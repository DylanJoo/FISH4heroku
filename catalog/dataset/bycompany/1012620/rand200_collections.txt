1012620_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	provide railcar switching services in the United States, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, we operate a railroad that runs approximately 1,400 miles north south between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	We operate in 28 states in the United States, four Australian states, one Australian territory and three Canadian provinces and provide rail service at 16 ports in North America and Europe.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Company s corporate predecessor was founded in 1899 as a 14-mile rail line serving a single salt mine in upstate New York.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we operated over approximately 7,400 miles of owned and leased track and approximately 1,400 additional miles under track access arrangements.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	Based on North American track miles, we believe that we are the second largest operator of short line and regional freight railroads in North America.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	By focusing our corporate and regional management teams on improving our return on invested capital, we intend to continue to increase our earnings and cash flow.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P1_S4	In addition, we expect that acquisitions will adhere to our return on capital targets and that existing operations will improve year-over-year financial returns and safety performance.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P1_S5	The two main drivers of our growth strategy are the execution of our disciplined acquisition and investment strategy as well as our operating strategy.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve customers in new projects.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Opportunities are generally of the following five types:
1012620_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Other regional railroads or short line railroads, such as our acquisitions of Rail Management Corporation (RMC), the Ohio Central Railroad System (OCR) and CAGY Industries, Inc. (CAGY).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	In the United States, there are approximately 500 short line and regional railroads not already owned by us, operating approximately 41,500 miles of track.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	International railroads, such as our acquisition of FreightLink (as defined below) and Rotterdam Rail Feeding (RRF).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also believe that there are additional acquisition and investment opportunities in Australia, Europe, Canada and other markets outside the United States.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Rail equipment and/or track infrastructure associated with new industrial and mineral development, such as new mining projects in Australia and North America.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	operating costs and increase equipment utilization.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	In new regions, we target rail properties that have adequate size to establish a presence in the region, provide a platform for growth in the region and attract qualified management.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	To help ensure accountability for the projected financial results of our potential acquisitions, we typically include the regional manager who would operate the rail property after the acquisition as part of our due diligence team.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S3	We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on additional acquisitions and investments and will continue to adhere to our disciplined approach when evaluating opportunities.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S4	Since 1985, we have completed 35 acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S5	In 2010, we acquired certain assets of FreightLink Pty Ltd (FL), Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd (APT) and the other APT joint venture sellers (together with FL and APT, FreightLink) in Australia (FreightLink Acquisition).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P7_S6	As a result of the FreightLink Acquisition, we are now the operator of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia, pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge and customer service that we view as necessary to achieve our financial goals.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our railroads operate under strong local management, with centralized administrative support and oversight.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our regional managers are continually focused on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following four principal elements:
1012620_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	Each year we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	Through the execution of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate per 200,000 man-hours worked from 5.89 injuries in 1998 to 0.51 in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We build each regional rail system on a base of large industrial customers, seek to grow that business through marketing efforts and pursue additional sources of revenue by attracting new customers and providing ancillary rail services.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	These ancillary rail services include railcar switching, repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enable shippers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our capacity to compete for new customers is enhanced by the open access environments in both Australia and Europe.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We focus on lowering operating costs and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than the companies from which we acquired these properties.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead, consolidating equipment and track maintenance contracts, reducing transportation costs and selling surplus assets.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	At the same time, we seek to maximize our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	For example, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for traffic type and density.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	In addition, because of the importance of certain customers and railroads to the regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state and/or federal grants to upgrade track.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our continuing operations were organized as nine businesses, which we refer to as regions.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In the United States, we have six regions: Illinois, New York/Ohio/Pennsylvania, Oregon, Rail Link (which includes industrial switching and port operations in various geographic locations), Rocky Mountain and Southern (principally consisting of railroads in the southern part of the United States).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	Outside the United States, we have three regions: Australia, Canada (which includes a contiguous railroad located in the United States) and the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	According to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), there are 563 railroads in the United States operating over 139,100 miles of track.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The AAR classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories (Class I, Regional and Local) based on the amount of revenues and track miles.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	Class I railroads, those with over $378.8 million in revenues, represent approximately 93% of total rail revenues.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	Regional and Local railroads combined account for approximately 7% of total rail revenues.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P16_S4	These Regional and Local railroads operate approximately 45,200 miles of track in the United States.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P16_S5	The primary function of these smaller railroads is to provide feeder traffic to the Class I carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	We operate one regional and 56 local (short line) railroads in the United States.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	The following table shows the breakdown of railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	(1) Includes CSX Transportation, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern, Kansas City Southern Railway Company, Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Source: AAR, Railroad Facts, 2010 Edition.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on these lines.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Divestiture of branch lines enabled Class I carriers to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment, and spurred the growth in the short line industry.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	According to Rail Trends 2010, published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are approximately 28,192 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We operate one regional and two local (short line) railroads in Canada.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Australia The Australian rail industry encompasses approximately 40,000 kilometers (25,000 miles) of both public and privately owned track linking mainland capital cities as well as regional centers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Australian network comprises three track gauges - broad, standard and narrow.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	There are three major public interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor from Sydney through Melbourne continuing across to Adelaide and Perth, the north-south corridor along the east coast from Cairns to Melbourne and the Darwin to Adelaide corridor.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks including those in central Queensland, Victoria, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, as well as several in Western Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Adelaide corridor that we operate pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are also an accredited rail-service provider in all mainland Australia states and the Northern Territory.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Australian rail freight industry is largely open access, and therefore is structured around two components operation of trains for freight haulage (above rail) and the operation and management of rail track access (below rail).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	RailCorp (New South Wales) and WestNet Rail (Western Australia).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	We are also a participant in the above rail industry along with QR National, Pacific National and SCT Logistics.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	Source: BITRE Transport Statistics Yearbook 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for the majority of the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,244 miles of track under its control on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Within the Netherlands, all train operators must have a license from the Inspectie Verkeer en Waterstaat, part of the Netherlands Department of Infrastructure, as well as licenses from ProRail and Keyrail, another rail infrastructure provider.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	According to the trade association, Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are currently 12 operators that provide freight rail services in the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2010, through our subsidiaries, we owned, leased or operated 62 short line and regional freight railroads with approximately 6,000 miles of track in the United States, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	In addition, we operated the approximately 1,400-mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	We also operated through various track access arrangements over approximately 1,400 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Freight Revenues We generate revenues primarily from the haulage of freight by rail over relatively short distances.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Freight revenues represented 62.2%, 61.2% and 61.5% of our total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Non-Freight Revenues We generate non-freight revenues primarily through the following activities:
1012620_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Other operating income includes, among others, revenues from providing crewing services and track access, as well as management fees.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Non-freight revenues represented 37.8%, 38.8% and 38.5% of our total operating revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Railcar switching represented 46.5%, 46.6% and 42.4% of our total non-freight revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	As of December 31, 2010, our operations served more than 850 freight customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	Freight revenues from our 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 22%, 21% and 20% of our total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	We typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Some of our railroads have a diversified commodity mix while others transport one or two principal commodities.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our coal and coke commodity revenues accounted for 12%, 10% and 12% of our total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	Our farm and food commodity freight revenues accounted for 9%, 6% and 6% of our total revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, see the discussion under Part II.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	The coal and coke commodity group consists primarily of shipments of coal to power plants and industrial customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	The pulp and paper commodity group consists primarily of outbound shipments of container board and finished papers and inbound shipments of wood pulp.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	The metals commodity group consists primarily of finished steel products such as coils, slabs and ingots, and pipe as well as scrap metal.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	The minerals and stone commodity group consists primarily of gypsum, salt used in highway ice control, cement, marble, limestone and sand.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S4	The lumber and forest products commodity group consists primarily of export logs, finished lumber, plywood, oriented strand board and particle board used in construction and furniture manufacturing, and wood chips and pulpwood used in paper manufacturing.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S5	The farm and food products commodity group consists primarily of wheat, barley, corn and other grains.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S6	The chemicals and plastics commodity group consists primarily of chemicals used in manufacturing, particularly in the paper industry.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S7	The petroleum products commodity group consists primarily of liquefied petroleum gases, asphalt and crude oil.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P36_S8	The autos and auto parts commodity group consists primarily of finished automobiles and stamped auto parts.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The metallic ores commodity group consists primarily of alumina, copper, manganese ore, iron ore and nickel ore.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	The intermodal commodity group consists of various commodities shipped in trailers or containers on flat cars.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	The other commodity group consists of all freight not included in the commodity groups set forth above, such as municipal solid waste, construction demolition and debris and haulage traffic.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our geographic areas, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Traffic Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized as interline, local or overhead traffic.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	Overhead traffic passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the carload originating or terminating on the line.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S4	Unlike overhead traffic, interline and local traffic provide us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S5	In 2010, revenues generated from interline and local traffic constituted approximately 96% of our freight revenues.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S6	Seasonality of Operations Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S7	In addition, due to adverse winter weather conditions, we also tend to incur higher operating costs during the first and fourth quarters.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S8	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P39_S9	In addition, as a result of the FreightLink Acquisition, we expect to experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season ( i.e. monsoonal rains).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our railroads and industrial switching locations had 2,502 full time employees.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Of this total, 878 employees are union members.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our railroads have 38 contracts with unions.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 12 of those agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 67 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Railway Labor Act (RLA) governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the United States.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	The RLA establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Le Code Canadian du Travail and the Federal Workplace Relations Act govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Canada and Australia, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	The RLA and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	In the Netherlands, RRF is not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also participate in safety committees of the AAR, governmental and industry sponsored safety programs and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association Safety Committee.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	Our reportable injury frequency rate, which is defined by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, was 0.51 and 0.74 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P46_S4	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads was 3.9 in 2010 (through November) and 3.7 in 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	We maintain liability and property insurance coverage.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our primary liability policies have self-insured retentions of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	Our property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, that are generally less than $1.0 million.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Employees of our United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under our liability policies.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	Employees of our industrial switching business are covered under workers compensation policies.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P48_S3	Employees of our Canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers compensation policy.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P48_S4	Employees of our Australian operations are covered by the respective state-based workers compensation legislation in Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P48_S5	Employees of RRF are covered by the workers compensation legislation of the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe our insurance coverage is adequate given our experience and the experience of the rail industry within the geographies we operate.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	In Australia and the Netherlands, however, our customers have access to other rail carriers under the open access regimes.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, our railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from motor carriers and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Most of the freight we handle is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	As a result, to the extent that other rail carriers are involved in transporting a shipment, we cannot necessarily control the cost and quality of such service.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	To a lesser degree, we also face competition with similar products made in other areas, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant versus paper plants in other locations.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	In acquiring rail properties, we generally compete with other short line and regional railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including private equity firms, operating in conjunction with short line rail operators.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	Competition for rail properties is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and operator of short line rail properties, combined with our managerial and financial resources, effectively positions us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	In addition to environmental laws, securities laws, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	The FRA, DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction over safety, which includes the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and rail car inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	In some cases, state and local laws and regulations may regulate certain aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise regulated by federal law.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	On January 12, 2010, the FRA issued final rules governing installation of positive train control (PTC) by the end of 2015.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Although still under development, PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	Certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC or PTC-related equipment by the end of 2015.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	We do not expect that our compliance with the final rules governing the installation of PTC will give rise to any significant financial expenditures.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	In addition, in 2010 the STB initiated several proceedings that explore the regulation of railroad operations and competition in the railroad industry.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	Congressional initiatives focused on the same topics are also underway.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	We are closely monitoring these proceedings and legislation.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P61_S4	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Canada St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec) is a federally regulated railroad and falls under the jurisdiction of the Canada Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and is subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Quebec Gatineau Railway Inc. and Huron Central Railway Inc. are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Ontario, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Provincially regulated railways operate only within one province and hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by a provincial authority.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	In the Province of Quebec, the Fitness Certificate is delivered by the Minist re des Transports du Quebec, while in Ontario, under the Shortline Railways Act, 1995, a license must be obtained from the Registrar of Shortline Railways.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	Construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated, as are railway services.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada s Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Australia In Australia, regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our Australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	Regulation of track access is governed by overriding federal legislation with state-based regimes operating in compliance with the federal legislation.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P66_S3	As a result, with respect to rail infrastructure access, our Australian subsidiaries are also subject to state-based access regimes and federal laws related to access and competition, including Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P66_S4	In addition, any new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management; the Transport, Public Works and Water Management Inspectorate; the Dutch railways manager, ProRail; and Keyrail, the Dutch railways manager for the Betuweroute, a high-speed freight railway connecting the Port of Rotterdam to the German border, and within the Port of Rotterdam.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition, at the European level, several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by railway.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	These directives generally cover the development of the railways, allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	The European Union (EU) legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach to railway safety.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network and EU Member States must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	These directives have been implemented in Dutch railway legislation such as the Railways Act.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Dutch Competition Authority (DCA) is charged with the supervision of compliance with the European Community s directives on the development of the railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are implemented principally by the Environmental Protection Agency and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	In Australia, these functions are administered primarily by the Department of Transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	In the Netherlands, national laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, while laws regulating the transportation of hazardous substances are primarily administered by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land acquired from them and used by our Australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	The Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession in Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	We believe that the facilities which we operate are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulation and agency agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	There are no material environmental claims currently pending or, to our knowledge, threatened against us or any of our railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S5	In addition, we believe our railroads operate in material compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S6	We estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P73_S7	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	In August of 2009, we completed the sale of 100% of the share of capital of Ferrocarriles Chiapas Mayab, S.A. de C.V. (FCCM), our Mexican operating subsidiary, to Viablis, S.A. de C.V. (Viablis).
1012620_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows on our remaining Mexican subsidiary, GW Servicios S.A. (Servicios), which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	We do not expect any material adverse financial impact from Servicios.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P74_S3	Results of our Mexican operations are included in results from discontinued operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on September 1, 1977.

1012620_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The global economy, which experienced a significant downturn starting in late 2008, including widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, began to improve in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	However, while some economic indicators trended positively, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2010 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad based and sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to us.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact our customers, our suppliers and our business in general.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Worsening of current macroeconomic and financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Since January 1, 1996, we have acquired interests in 55 railroads, all of which were purchased for cash.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had $27.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $192.2 million of undrawn revolver capacity available for acquisitions or other activities, subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In addition, from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S7	If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Our inability to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S9	We may not be able to acquire or integrate acquired companies or businesses successfully.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Evaluating acquisition targets gives rise to additional costs related to legal, financial, operating and industry due diligence.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S11	In addition, acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and, to the extent financed with debt, additional interest costs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant restructuring costs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P6_S13	The process of acquiring businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the diversion of management s attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on extensive analyses.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, operating costs and competitive factors, most of which are beyond our control and may not materialize.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	While we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Also, the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Finally, the physical conditions of the assets acquired may not be sufficient to support the operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our results of operations and rail structure are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the Northeastern United States and Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the Southeastern United States and Australia, could cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations, it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our minerals and stone revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the Northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our coal and coke revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the Midwestern United States, which lessen demand for coal.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues generated by our Australian operations are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the South Australian grain harvest and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the Northern Territory.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by such weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the Northeastern United States and Canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Such weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In the United States, these agencies include the STB, DOT, FRA of the DOT, OSHA, DHS and other federal agencies and state departments of transportation.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In Australia, we are subject to both Commonwealth and state regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In Canada, we are subject to regulation by the CTA, TC and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of Quebec and Ontario.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, the Transport, Public Works and Water Management Inspectorate and Dutch railways managers, ProRail and Keyrail.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Business Regulation for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	There are various legislative and regulatory actions being considered in the United States, including legislation proposed in the Senate in January 2011 that would modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry and various proceedings that have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Federal, state and local regulatory authorities may change the regulatory framework without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes may have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As a result, changes to legislation and the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our credit agreement and note purchase agreements contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our credit agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our failure to comply with the obligations in our credit agreement could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the credit agreement, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S4	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S8	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P21_S9	As a result, unexpected credit exposures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our operations served more than 850 freight customers in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Freight revenues from our 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a majority of our operations, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In 2010, approximately 85% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Deterioration in the operations of or service provided by those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For instance, we lease several railroads from Class I carriers under long-term lease arrangements, which collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our 2010 total revenues.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, we own several railroads that also lease portions of the track or right of way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Expiration or termination of these leases or failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	However, in certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia and the Netherlands, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally motor carriers and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our network.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P29_S5	In addition, competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S7	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P30_S8	For information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, see Additional Risks Associated with our Foreign Operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Market and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our operating costs and decrease demand for the commodities we transport.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Clean air laws, restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Any of these factors, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S7	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S9	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned by us.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Under some environmental statutes, such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several, whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs, including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate such risks could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	While these financial instruments reduce the Company s exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit the Company s ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We consumed 18.5 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses and an increase in diesel fuel costs could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Although we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset rising fuel prices, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 9% and 8% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P36_S5	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S4	For instance, recently enacted legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	On certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are commingled with passenger trains.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	For instance, in Oregon we operate certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon over our Portland Western Railroad.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed expected statutory limits, third-party insurance limits and our insurance limits.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Unless it is extended, the expiration of the short line tax credit on December 31, 2011, will increase our effective tax rate.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the short line tax credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of their tax year.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In 2010 and 2009, the Short Line Tax Credit lowered our effective tax rate by 9.3% and 15.0%, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	The most recent extension of the Short Line Tax Credit only extends the credit through December 31, 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, the loss of the credit will increase our effective tax rate and reduce our reported earnings per share.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our ability to obtain government funding.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	During 2010, we obtained government funding for 63 separate projects that were partially funded by United States and Canadian federal, state and municipal agencies.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 37% of our total capital expenditures during 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S5	In addition, competition for government funding from other short line railroads, Class I railroads and other companies is significant, and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S6	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations, such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S7	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo such capital projects.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S9	We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia and Canada.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S10	In North America, we are party to 37 contracts with national labor organizations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S11	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 12 of those agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P41_S12	We have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional 67 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S2	To date, we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S3	We are also subject to the risk of the unionization of our non-unionized employees.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S5	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S6	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S7	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S8	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 19% of the current workforce will become eligible for retirement.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S10	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S11	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S12	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S13	If any of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our profit margins could decrease and our growth strategy could be impaired.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S14	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain rail cars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S15	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as rail cars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P43_S16	If the number of available rail cars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these rail cars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain rail cars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	As of January 1, 2011, according to the AAR, approximately 21% of the North American railcar fleet was in storage.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In some cases we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and locomotives may not be available.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S6	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S7	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P44_S8	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	FELA s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker s compensation system.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our operations in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands accounted for 21.5%, 7.9% and 1.7% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Our operations in Australia, Canada and the Netherlands accounted for 30.7%, 6.3% and 1.2% of our long-lived assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be cancelled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S5	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Further, the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S7	Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Open access regimes in Australia and the Netherlands could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The Netherlands also has an open access regime that permits third-party rail operators to compete for RRF s business.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and the Netherlands could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P54_S7	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia and the Netherlands hold safety accreditations that are required to provide freight rail services.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in Australia is a requirement under our concession deeds.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal and expiration.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational performance and financial results.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Changes to the mining tax regime in Australia could have a negative impact on our existing customers and the prospects for new customer initiatives underway.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	On May 2, 2010, the Australian Government announced its intention to introduce a Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT).
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	On July 2, 2010, the Australian Government announced that it proposes to replace the RSPT with a new Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT).
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The MRRT would apply to Australian entities iron ore and coal projects after July 2012.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In the event that such a tax is implemented, this could result in an increase in operating costs for mining assets based in Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	This may render certain existing and proposed projects not economically viable and result in mining companies choosing to cancel projects currently planned to meet growing demand, as well as reducing the level of investment in the Australian resources sector.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Any of these changes could have an adverse effect on our Australian operations by reducing the volume of commodities mined in Australia for us to transport, as well as by reducing levels of demand for Australian commodities and our transportation of those commodities.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P58_S6	Consequently, the introduction of the MRRT could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Australia recognizes a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of indigenous inhabitants to their traditional lands, which could impact our GWA North operations.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	There are a number of native title claims registered with the National Native Title Tribunal that could give rise to native title rights on discrete parcels of land over which we operate.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	While no native title claims have been made against lots associated with our business to date, there is a risk that a claim could be made that native title exists.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	A successful claim could prevent or limit our use of the land or require us to make payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	GWA is subject to several contractual restrictions on its ability to compete.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	As a result of our June 2006 sale of the Western Australia operations and certain other assets of the Australian Railroad Group Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries (ARG) to Queensland Rail and Babcock Brown Limited (ARG Sale), GWA is subject to (a) a five-year non-compete (expiring June 2011) in the State of Western Australia, the Melbourne to Adelaide corridor and certain areas within the State of New South Wales historically served by ARG; (b) a right of first refusal for the benefit of Queensland Rail with respect to the sale of (i) GWA or a majority of the ownership of GWA and (ii) a number of high horsepower locomotives and intermodal wagons owned or operated by GWA and (c) a five-year restriction (expiring in June 2011) on hiring of ARG employees who remain employed by ARG after the sale.
1012620_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	These contractual restrictions may place limits on our ability to grow GWA s business or divest of certain assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	one is located in Australia and one is located in the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	In addition, we operate the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	These rail properties typically consist of the track and the underlying land.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Real estate adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way is generally owned by others, and our holdings of such real estate are not material.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Similarly, sellers typically retain mineral rights and rights to grant fiber optic and other easements in the properties acquired by us.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	Several of our railroads are operated under leases or operating licenses in which we do not assume ownership of the track or the underlying land.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our railroads operate over approximately 7,400 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	We also operate, through various trackage rights agreements, over approximately 1,400 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	The track miles listed below exclude 921 miles of sidings and yards located in the United States (769 miles), Canada (87 miles) and Australia (65 miles), as well as track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia and the Netherlands.

1012620_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	In addition, we recorded a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and $2.3 million of restructuring expense, which were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million related to HCRY.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	(3) In 2008, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Summit View, Inc., the parent company of 10 short line railroads known as the Ohio Central Railway System (OCR) with net assets of $227.8 million; CAGY Industries, Inc., the parent company of three short line railroads, with net assets of $107.2 million; Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V. in the Netherlands with net assets of $23.6 million; and Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Inc. with net assets of $17.1 million.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	(4) In 2007, we acquired 87.4% of Maryland Midland Railway, Inc. with net assets of $30.7 million.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P5_S1	Also in 2007, we ceased our Mexican rail operations and initiated formal liquidation proceedings of FCCM, our wholly owned Mexican subsidiary.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P5_S2	As a result of our formal notification to the Secretaria de Communicaciones y Transportes (SCT) of our intent to exercise our right to resign our Mexican operations, the SCT seized substantially all of our Mexican operating assets.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P5_S3	As a result of these and other actions, we recorded a $25.4 million loss from discontinued operations in 2007, partially offset by a United States tax benefit of $11.3 million, primarily related to a worthless stock and bad debt deductions to be claimed in the United States.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P6_S0	(5) In 2006, GWI and our former 50% partner in the Australian Railroad Group Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries (ARG), Wesfarmers Limited (Wesfarmers), completed the sale of the Western Australia operations and certain other assets of ARG to Queensland Rail and Babcock Brown Limited (ARG Sale).
1012620_11_ITEM6_P6_S1	As a result of the ARG Sale, we recognized a $218.8 million net gain, including a $22.8 million gain from the cumulative translation of the foreign currency investment and related equity earnings in ARG into United States dollars since 2000.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P6_S2	In connection with the ARG Sale, the Company also incurred $6.4 million of net transaction-related expenses, of which $5.8 million related to management bonuses and stock option awards.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P6_S3	Simultaneous with the ARG Sale, we purchased Wesfarmers 50% ownership of the remaining ARG operations for $15.1 million (GWA Purchase).
1012620_11_ITEM6_P7_S0	Since GWI previously held a 50% share of these assets through its ownership interest in ARG, it applied a step-method to the allocation of value among the assets and liabilities of GWA.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P7_S1	Because the $15.1 million purchase price for Wesfarmers 50% share was lower than 50% of the book value ARG had historically recorded on these assets, we recorded a non-cash loss of $16.2 million ($11.3 million, net of tax), representing our 50% share of the impairment loss recorded by ARG, which was included in equity income of unconsolidated international affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations in 2006.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P7_S2	Accordingly, we included 100% of the value of GWA s net assets ($30.1 million) in our consolidated balance sheet since June 1, 2006.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P7_S3	In addition, in 2006 we determined that our indirect investments in Bolivia had suffered an other-than-temporary decline in value as a result of the heightened political and economic unrest and uncertainties in that country and we wrote down $5.9 million of the investment with a corresponding charge to earnings.
1012620_11_ITEM6_P7_S4	Discontinued operations included a non-cash charge of $33.1 million ($34.1 million, net of tax) reflecting the write-down of non-current assets and related costs associated with FCCM.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our consolidated financial statements were determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Outlook for 2011 North American and European economic activity improved late in the first quarter of 2010 and then stabilized for the rest of the year.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We expect the North American and European economies to remain stable in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect the South Australia and Northern Territory economies to remain strong in 2011, benefitting from continued strength in the natural resources sector.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	We expect that the largest single impact on 2011 financial results for GWI will be the full year impact of the FreightLink Acquisition that closed on December 1, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	In addition to the impact of the FreightLink Acquisition, we expect same railroad revenues to increase in 2011 primarily due to two factors.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	First, we expect same railroad revenues to increase from additional carloads and overall higher average revenues per carload.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S6	Second, the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro versus the United States dollar are currently at levels higher than the average exchange rates experienced in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S7	If sustained, the translation impact of the change in exchange rates will increase our reported revenues in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S8	In 2011, we expect same railroad carload volumes to be higher than 2010 across nearly all commodity groups.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S9	We expect the most significant increases in the metals, other commodities and farm and food products groups.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S10	Metals traffic is expected to increase due to inclusion of carloads from the Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY) and a significant customer plant expansion.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S11	On January 1, 2011, HCRY started operating under a new agreement with certain customers and GWI has resumed reporting carloads for HCRY.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S12	Other commodities are expected to increase due to higher haulage traffic and increases in municipal solid waste traffic.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S13	Farm and food traffic is expected to increase, primarily due to a larger Australian grain harvest in 2010 that is expected to ship in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S14	We expect same railroad average revenues per carload to increase due to (1) increases in North American rail pricing, (2) the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars versus the United States dollar and (3) increases in fuel surcharges as a result of higher fuel prices.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S15	We expect same railroad non-freight revenues to increase in 2011 primarily due to the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars versus the United States dollar, which, if sustained, will result in higher industrial and port terminal switching revenues and stronger third party fuel sales volumes.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S16	We expect same railroad demurrage and storage income to decline, primarily due to fewer third party cars stored on our railroads.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S17	Same railroad operating expenses are expected to increase in 2011 primarily due to four factors.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S18	First, we expect an increase in transportation expenses and diesel fuel consumption due to the increase in carloads.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S19	Second, diesel fuel prices are currently much higher than the average prices experienced in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S20	If diesel fuel prices remain at current levels we expect that diesel fuel expense will be significantly higher in 2011 than in 2010, from both higher fuel prices and also higher levels of fuel consumption.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S21	Third, we expect higher depreciation expense in 2011 due to the higher levels of our capital spending in recent years.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S22	Fourth, we expect higher operating expenses as a result of the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro versus the United States dollar.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P2_S23	We expect that the full year contribution of the FreightLink Acquisition and higher revenues due to volume and rate increases at our existing operations will offset expected higher costs for transportation, fuel and depreciation resulting in an improvement in our operating ratio.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Overview We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching services in the United States, Australia, Canada and the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition, we operate the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Operations currently include 63 railroads organized in nine regions, with approximately 7,400 miles of owned and leased track and approximately 1,400 additional miles under track access arrangements.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	In addition, we provide rail service at 16 ports in North America and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	On December 1, 2010, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of FreightLink for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, included results from GWA (North) Pty Ltd (GWA North), our subsidiary that acquired certain assets from FreightLink, since the acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our 2010 results included $11.6 million of revenues from GWA North and a loss from operations of $13.6 million from GWA North.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	The $13.6 million loss from operations included A$16.9 million (or $16.4 million at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) of stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax), which was directly attributable to the acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	Our consolidated results also included an additional $11.8 million of FreightLink acquisition-related expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	GWI s subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), historically operated FreightLink s rail haulage services and provided its crews, managed its train operations and also leased locomotives and wagons to FreightLink.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Accordingly, in arriving at our consolidated results, we eliminated $2.9 million of non-freight revenues and operating expenses for these services provided to GWA North by GWA for the month of December 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	Net income attributable to GWI in the year ended December 31, 2010, was $81.3 million, compared with net income attributable to GWI of $61.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to common stockholders in the year ended December 31, 2010, were $1.94 with 41.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS attributable to common stockholders of $1.57 with 39.0 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	Income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2010, was $78.7 million, compared with income from continuing operations of $60.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S5	Our diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders in the year ended December 31, 2010, were $1.88 with 41.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders of $1.54 with 39.0 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S6	Operating revenues increased $85.3 million, or 15.7%, to $630.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $544.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P6_S7	The increase in our operating revenues was due to an increase of $76.6 million, or 14.1%, from existing operations and $8.7 million from GWA North.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	When we discuss either revenues from existing operations or same railroad revenues, we are referring to the change in our revenues, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Freight revenues increased $58.6 million, or 17.5%, to $392.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $333.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The $58.6 million increase consisted of a $47.3 million increase in freight revenues from existing operations and $11.3 million in freight revenues from new operations.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	The increase in freight revenues from existing operations included a $29.4 million increase due to an 8.4% increase in carloads, a $4.6 million increase due to higher fuel surcharges and an $8.3 million increase due to the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Non-freight revenues increased $26.8 million, or 12.7%, to $237.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $211.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	operations increased $29.3 million, or 13.9%.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The increase in non-freight revenues from existing operations included a $9.3 million increase in railcar switching revenues, a $7.2 million increase in other operating income and a $4.0 million increase in fuel sales to third parties.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by the depreciation of the Euro relative to the United States dollar, further increased non-freight revenues by $8.5 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	Operating income in the year ended December 31, 2010, increased $31.1 million, or 31.3%, to $130.4 million, compared with $99.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	Our operating ratio was 79.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with an operating ratio of 81.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S5	Our operating income in the year ended December 31, 2010, included $28.2 million of FreightLink acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by an $8.7 million gain associated with a legal settlement related to a past acquisition, a $6.4 million net gain on sale of assets and a $2.3 million reversal of accrued restructuring expenses associated with the second quarter of 2009 impairment of HCRY.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S6	Our operating income in the year ended December 31, 2009, included a net loss on the sale and impairment of assets of $4.0 million, restructuring and related expenses of $2.3 million and $1.1 million of legal expense associated with resolution of an arbitration proceeding, partially offset by gain on insurance recoveries of $3.1 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated $171.8 million in cash from operating activities from continuing operations.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S8	We paid $320.0 million for the acquisition of the assets of FreightLink and used $119.8 million for capital expenditures.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P8_S9	We received $26.4 million in grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in 2010, $14.4 million in cash from grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in prior years, $10.0 million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and $123.2 million net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Changes in Operations Australia On December 1, 2010, through our subsidiary, GWA North, we completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	GWI s statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the results from GWA North, GWI s subsidiary that acquired certain assets of FreightLink, since the acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Pursuant to the Business Sale Agreement, we acquired FreightLink's freight rail business between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, certain material contracts, equipment and property leases, as well as FreightLink's plant, equipment and business inventory.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P9_S3	In addition, as part of the acquisition, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represents the fair value of an A$50 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P9_S4	As a result of the acquisition, GWA North is now the concessionaire and operator of the approximately 1,400-mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P9_S5	The rail line is located on land leased to GWA North by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation (a statutory corporation established by legislation in the Northern Territory) under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	GWA North is both a provider of rail haulage to customers on its railroad (above rail services), as well as a track owner, charging access fees to any rail operators that run on its track (below rail services).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The track access rights are regulated under a statutory access regime established by legislation in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our subsidiary, GWA, has historically operated FreightLink's rail haulage services, provided its crews, managed its train operations and leased locomotives and wagons to FreightLink.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result of the acquisition, approximately A$25 million (or $25.5 million at the December 31, 2010 exchange rate) of annual GWA non-freight revenues generated from services that have historically been provided to FreightLink will be eliminated in consolidation, but this elimination will not have any effect on our operating income.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Prior to the completion of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, potential mining projects located in the Northern Territory had no economic transportation link to an export port.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Since the completion of the rail line in 2003, there has been an increase in mineral exploration and development in the Northern Territory and South Australia along the rail corridor.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe that the FreightLink Acquisition provides us significant organic growth opportunities as it positions us to capitalize on future mineral development in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	We accounted for the transaction using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of FreightLink have been recorded at their respective estimated acquisition-date fair values and have been consolidated with those of GWI as of the acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	The final determination of these estimated fair values is subject to completion of an ongoing assessment and may differ materially from the preliminary estimate.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the preliminary balance sheet to United States dollars was $0.96 for one Australian dollar (which was the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P13_S6	The preliminary acquisition-date fair values assigned to the acquired net assets were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	On January 1, 2009, we adopted a new accounting standard in accordance with U.S. GAAP that changed the accounting for mergers and acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Under the new accounting standard, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, rather than capitalized.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	We incurred $28.2 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2010, including $16.4 million related to stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	We financed the purchase of FreightLink s assets through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings of $100.0 million and A$97.0 million (or $94.0 million at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) under our Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	For a description of the material terms and conditions under our Credit Agreement, as amended, see the discussion under Item 7.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Agreement.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	In June 2009, we announced that our subsidiary, HCRY, intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Consequently, in the second quarter of 2009 we recorded charges of $5.4 million after-tax associated with HCRY.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	These charges reflected a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and restructuring expenses of $2.3 million, and were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In September 2010, the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario agreed to provide C$30 million (or $30 million at the December 31, 2010 exchange rate) to fund infrastructure improvements that, combined with certain customer agreements, will enable HCRY to continue operations on a long-term basis.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	In addition, HCRY expects to fund approximately $3 million for infrastructure improvements.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	longer intends to cease its operations.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Because of the substance of the temporary agreement HCRY was operating under from August 15, 2009, through December 31, 2010, HCRY s net operating earnings were included within non-freight revenues as other operating income.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	On January 1, 2011, HCRY began operating under a new agreement with certain customers.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Because of the substance of the new arrangement, we expect to resume reporting HCRY s operating revenues and operating expenses on a gross basis within each respective line item of our statement of operations in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	On September 29, 2009, in conjunction with our partner, UniRail LLC, we sold substantially all of our interests in Ferroviaria Oriental S.A., which is located in Eastern Bolivia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We recorded a net gain on the sale of our investment in Bolivia of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our portion of the sale proceeds totaled $3.9 million, against which we applied the remaining net book value of $3.4 million and direct costs of the sale of $0.1 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	In August 2009, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of our Mexican operating subsidiary, FCCM, to Viablis for a net sale price of $2.2 million, including the deposit of $0.5 million received in November 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	Accordingly, we recorded a net gain of $2.2 million on the sale within discontinued operations.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	In August 2010, we recognized a net gain of $2.8 million ($2.8 million after-tax) within discontinued operations due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to damages incurred by FCCM as a result of Hurricane Stan in 2005.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	GWI will utilize capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset any tax on this gain.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of our remaining Mexican subsidiary, GW Servicios S.A., which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	We do not expect any material future adverse financial impact from our remaining Mexican subsidiary.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Results from Continuing Operations When comparing our results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another, consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to economic conditions, acquisitions, competitive forces, one-time freight moves, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, droughts, heavy snowfall, freezing and flooding.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	In periods when these events occur, results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, including steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	However, shipments of other commodities are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at a customer power plant (coal), winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (South Australian grain).

1012620_11_ITEM7_P47_S8	For 2009, primary drivers of cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were $88.9 million of cash used for capital expenditures and $5.8 million of cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $17.9 million in cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in 2009, $6.7 million in cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in prior years, $8.3 million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment, $4.0 million of insurance proceeds and $3.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our investment in Bolivia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P47_S9	For 2008, primary drivers of cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were $345.5 million of cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $97.9 million of cash used for capital expenditures and $7.5 million of contingent consideration held in escrow, partially offset by $19.3 million in cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending completed in 2008, $9.3 million in cash received from outside parties for capital spending completed prior to 2008, $8.1 million in cash proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and $0.4 million of insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P47_S10	During 2010, 2009 and 2008, our cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations were $140.0 million, ($7.3) million and $279.5 million, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P47_S11	For 2010, primary drivers of cash provided by financing from continuing operations were a net increase in outstanding debt of $123.2 million and net cash inflows of $19.3 million from exercises of stock-based awards, partially offset by $2.5 million of debt amendment costs.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P47_S12	For 2009, primary drivers of cash used in financing activities from continuing operations were a net decrease in outstanding debt of $116.2 million and $4.4 million of cash paid for a change in our ownership of a noncontrolling interest, partially offset by $106.6 million of proceeds from the June 2009 public offering of 4,600,000 shares of our Class A common stock at $24.50 per share and $6.6 million from exercises of stock-based awards.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P47_S13	We used the offering proceeds along with cash on hand to repay $108.0 million of our revolving credit facility, which represented the entire balance then outstanding.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	For 2008, primary drivers of cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations were a net increase in outstanding debt of $275.0 million and net cash inflows of $8.8 million from exercises of stock-based awards, partially offset by $4.3 million of debt issuance costs.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had long-term debt, including current portion, totaling $578.9 million, which comprised 41.5% of our total capitalization and $192.2 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	At December 31, 2009, we had long-term debt, including current portion, totaling $449.4 million, which comprised 39.5% of our total capitalization and $299.9 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	We believe that our cash and cash equivalents combined with our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of our Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	We intend to use our cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes, including strategic investments and acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Credit Agreement On August 8, 2008, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the Credit Agreement).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	The Credit Agreement expanded the size of our senior credit facility from $256.0 million to $570.0 million and extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to October 1, 2013.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Credit Agreement included a $300.0 million revolving loan, a $240.0 million United States term loan and a C$31.2 million ($31.3 million at the December 31, 2010 exchange rate) Canadian term loan, as well as borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice referred to as swingline loans.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Credit Agreement provides lending under the revolving credit facility in United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	Interest rates for the revolving loans are based on a base rate plus applicable margin or the LIBOR rate plus applicable margin.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P50_S5	The Credit Agreement and revolving loans are guaranteed by substantially all of the United States subsidiaries for the United States guaranteed obligations and by substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries for the foreign guaranteed obligations.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	On June 30, 2010, we entered into Amendment No. 1 and Joinder to the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the Credit Agreement Amendment).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Credit Agreement Amendment facilitated the acquisition of the assets of FreightLink by GWA North.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Among other matters, the Credit Agreement Amendment (i) amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to add back acquisition costs incurred in connection with the Freightlink Acquisition to EBITDA in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million; (ii) amended the restrictions on indebtedness; and (iii) amended the restrictions on investments and restricted payments to permit certain intercompany obligations, investments and guarantees.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Credit Agreement Amendment also changed the definition of Consolidated EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rental payments on operating leases and non-cash compensation expense) to give pro forma effect to the FreightLink Acquisition, allowed for an additional United States borrower and amended certain covenants to permit the FreightLink Acquisition and the entry into related documentation.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	On October 15, 2010, we entered into Amendment No. 2 and Joinder to the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement, which provides, among other things, commitments for our United States and Australian borrowers to draw an additional $50 million revolving loan which effectively increased our revolving loan capacity from $300.0 million to $350.0 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Effective as of December 1, 2010, in each case dependent on a ratio of funded debt to EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rental payments on operating leases and non-cash compensation expense), the range of applicable margins applied to borrowings are as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Financial covenants, which are measured on a trailing 12-month basis and calculated quarterly, are as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	a. Maximum leverage of 3.5 times, measured as Funded Debt (indebtedness plus guarantees and letters of credit by any of the borrowers, plus certain contingent acquisition purchase price amounts, plus the present value of all operating leases) to EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rental payments on operating leases and non-cash compensation expense).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	b. Minimum interest coverage of 3.5 times, measured as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) divided by interest expense.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The financial covenant that is tested and reported annually is as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	c. Capital expenditures: Generally restricts us from making capital expenditures in any fiscal year that exceed, in the aggregate, 20% of the net revenues of the parties of the loan for the preceding fiscal year.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The 20% of net revenues limitation on capital expenditures may be increased under certain conditions.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create certain liens, make certain investments, sell assets, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain consolidations or mergers unless under permitted acquisitions, issue subsidiary stock, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain modifications to certain documents such as the senior notes and make other restricted payments consisting of stock repurchases and cash dividends.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Credit Agreement allows us to repurchase stock and pay dividends provided that the ratio of Funded Debt to EBITDAR, including any borrowings made to fund the dividend or distribution, is less than 3.0 to 1.0 but subject to certain limitations if the ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1.0.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of our Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	Subject to maintaining compliance with these covenants, the $192.2 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2010, is available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Senior Notes In 2005, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million of Series B senior notes and $25.0 million of Series C senior notes.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Series B senior notes bear interest at 5.36% and are due in August 2015.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Series C senior notes have a borrowing rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.70% and are due in August 2012.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Series C senior notes had an interest rate of 0.99%.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In 2004, we completed a $75.0 million private placement of Series A senior notes.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Series A senior notes bear interest at 4.85% and are due in November 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	We expect to refinance the Series A senior notes in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S3	The senior notes are unsecured but are guaranteed by substantially all of our United States and Canadian subsidiaries.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S4	The senior notes contain a number of covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, create certain liens, enter into certain consolidations or mergers and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S5	Financial covenants, which must be satisfied quarterly, include (a) maximum debt to capitalization of 65% and (b) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.75 times (measured as EBITDAR for the preceding 12 months divided by interest expense plus operating lease payments for the preceding 12 months).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P62_S6	As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the provisions of these covenants.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for rail cars, locomotives and other equipment.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we leased 10,196 rail cars and 48 locomotives.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	Related operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $13.1 million, $12.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	We lease certain real property, which resulted in operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, of $5.0 million, $4.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	In 2010, we purchased certain leased locomotive assets for $7.4 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S5	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers to operate over various rail lines in North America.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S6	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S7	Under certain other of these leases, no payments to the lessors are required as long as certain operating conditions are met.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P63_S8	No material payments were required under these lease agreements in 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, state and local agencies and other outside parties (e.g., customers) for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	We believe that the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	2011 Budgeted Capital Expenditures We have budgeted $109 million for capital expenditures in 2011, which consists of track and equipment improvements of $71 million, $1 million in equipment lease buyouts and new business development projects of $37 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	In addition, we expect to receive approximately $29 million of grants from outside parties to fund additional property and equipment expenditures related to our existing business in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	Including the grant-funded projects, we have budgeted a total of $138 million for capital expenditures in 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S4	We believe that our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the Credit Agreement.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S5	As of December 31, 2010, we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments that could affect our financial condition.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P65_S6	However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	(1) Excludes capital lease obligations of $0.4 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	(3) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swap of $9.1 million and the fair value of our cross currency swap of $7.6 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	(4) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	(5) Includes deferred compensation of $6.0 million, estimated casualty obligations of $2.9 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $0.4 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	In addition, the table includes estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $3.2 million and our 2011 estimated contributions of $0.1 million to our pension plans.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we 1) have made guarantees, 2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, 3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or 4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2010, consist of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues When comparing the effects on revenues of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2010, versus the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign currency translation had a net positive impact on our consolidated revenues due to the strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	Since the world s major crude oil and refined products are traded in United States dollars, we believe there was little, if any, impact of foreign currency translation on our fuel sales to third parties in Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P73_S3	Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to such estimates in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	We account for businesses we acquired subsequent to January 1, 2009, using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P76_S3	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P76_S4	Previously, we accounted for businesses we acquired using the purchase method of accounting.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P76_S5	We allocated the total cost of an acquisition, including certain acquisition-related costs, to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	Major renewals or improvements, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge s capacity to carry increased loading and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	Other than a de-minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	As a result, we typically incur minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
1012620_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the road property and equipment.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	3 20 years We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment, since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 th of each year, and no impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	We first compare the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including our assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as customer relationships or contracts, service agreements, track access agreements and proprietary software.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the customer relationship, the facility served or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain liability and property insurance coverage.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S4	Our primary liability policies have self-insured retentions of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S5	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S6	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P91_S7	Accruals for FELA claims by our railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, that are generally less than $1.0 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for grants to our employees under our Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P93_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment, the expected life and expected volatility of the stock.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	The expected life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P94_S2	The expected volatility of the stock is based on historical and implied volatility.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P94_S3	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, compensation cost from equity awards was $7.1 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $8.5 million, which will be recognized over the next three years with a weighted average period of 1.2 years.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for equity awards was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, compensation cost from equity awards was $6.5 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for equity awards was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2008, compensation cost from equity awards was $5.7 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P96_S3	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated income statement for equity awards was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	In our consolidated balance sheets, these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	A deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards, is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, our deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, was $116.8 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Other Uncertainties Our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward-looking statements.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	For a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject, and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented.
1012620_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	We do not trade or use such instruments with the objective of earning financial gains from interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations, nor do we use such instruments where there are no underlying cash exposures.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Management believes that our use of derivative financial instruments to manage risk is in our best interest.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	However, our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Interest Rate Risk Risk Sensitivity Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	The following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using United States LIBOR, Australia BBSW, Canadian LIBOR and Euro LIBOR (as of December 31, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 2.00% for United States, Australia, Canada and Europe borrowings under our Credit Agreement and 0.70% for our Series C senior notes.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $2.8 million.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Furthermore, if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment, we believe we would incur interest rates no worse, and potentially better, than our current rates.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We apply the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value:
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Since our long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, the future interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	These agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	To value the interest rate swaps, a discounted cash flow model is utilized.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	Management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income (loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	On October 2, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The swap has a notional amount of $120.0 million and requires us to pay 3.88% on the notional amount and allows us to receive one-month LIBOR.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P12_S2	This swap expires on September 30, 2013.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 valuation inputs.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The fair value of the interest rate swap represented a liability of $9.1 million as of December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P13_S2	The one-month LIBOR was set at 0.26% at December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Third-party debt related to our foreign operations, $133 million, is denominated in the currency of the countries in which our subsidiaries operate, including Australia, Canada and Europe.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P14_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P14_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P14_S3	However, in the event foreign currency debt service, either interest, principal amortization or repayment due at maturity in October 2013, if not refinanced, is funded from our United States operations, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P14_S4	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from our United States operations to our foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P15_S0	From time to time, we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P15_S1	To mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P16_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P17_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P17_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income(expense).
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P18_S0	On December 1, 2010, we completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P18_S1	We financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P18_S2	A portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to Australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of A$105.0 million (or $100.6 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S0	non-functional currency intercompany loan, we entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which Swap effectively converted the A$105.0 million loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S1	The Swap requires us to pay AUD BBSW plus 3.125% based on a notional amount of A$105 million and allows us to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.48% based on a notional amount of $100.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S2	The Company realized an expense of $0.4 million within interest income(expense) related to the quarterly settlement of the swap for the period ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S3	In addition, the Company recognized a net loss of $1.0 million within other income (expense) related to the mark-to-market of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate on December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S4	This net loss was caused by a loss of $7.6 million related to the mark-to-market of the cross-currency swap and a gain of $6.6 million related to the mark-to-market of the intercompany debt.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S5	The fair value of the cross-currency swap represented a liability of $7.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S6	The Swap expires on December 1, 2012.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P19_S7	The fair value of the cross-currency swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 valuation inputs.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P20_S0	On November 24, 2010, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, with funds to be delivered on December 1, 2010, to secure an exchange rate for A$45 million of the A$331.9 million purchase of the FreightLink assets.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P20_S1	The subsequent decrease in the value of Australian dollar versus the United States dollar between November 24, 2010 and December 1, 2010 and its impact on the A$45 million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of $0.7 million within other income (expense).
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P20_S2	The following table summarizes the impact of these foreign currency financial instruments on our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010:
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P21_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P21_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2010, fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 9.2% of our total expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P21_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_11_ITEM7A_P21_S4	As of December 31, 2010, each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $0.5 million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010, to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P0_S4	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company's internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company's Audit Committee.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_11_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2010, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.

1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Genesee Wyoming Inc.:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and changes in equity and comprehensive income present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P22_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P23_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1012620_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

1012620_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) currently have interests in 63 railroads, of which 57 are located in the United States, three are located in Canada, two are located in Australia and one is located in the Netherlands.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, the Company acquired 17 railroads in the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, sold its operations in Mexico and sold substantially all of its investments in South America.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Through its subsidiaries, the Company owns and operates short line and regional freight railroads and provides rail car switching and ancillary rail services.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	In addition, the Company also operates a railroad that runs approximately 1,400 miles north-south between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	See Note 3, Changes in Operations, for descriptions of the Company s changes in operations in recent years.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	A large portion of the Company s operating revenues is attributable to industrial customers operating in the paper and forest products, electricity generation and farm and food products industries.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	Freight revenues from the Company s 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 22%, 21% and 20% of the Company s operating revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Revenue Recognition Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company s tracks, which, due to the relatively short length of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies consist of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Materials and supplies are removed from inventory using the average cost method.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company accounts for businesses acquired subsequent to January 1, 2009 using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company records the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	As part of this process, the Company identifies and attributes values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	Previously, the Company accounted for businesses acquired using the purchase method of accounting.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S3	The Company allocated the total cost of an acquisition, including certain acquisition-related costs, to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S4	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S5	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S6	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P39_S7	Major renewals or improvements are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	Other than a de-minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company s short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P41_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the road property and equipment.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company s major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	3 20 years The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	When factors indicate that assets may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P43_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P43_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P44_S3	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment review as of November 30 th of each year.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P46_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company s assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company is required to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as customer relationships or contracts, service agreements, track access agreements and proprietary software.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the customer relationship, the facility served, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims The Company maintains property and liability insurance coverage.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company s primary liability policies have a self-insured retention of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P53_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company s liability policies.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company s property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, that are generally less than $1.0 million.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P55_S2	Earnings per Share Common shares issuable under unexercised stock options calculated under the treasury stock method and weighted average Class B common shares outstanding are the only reconciling items between the Company s basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P55_S3	The total number of options used to calculate weighted average share equivalents for diluted earnings per share as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, was as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P55_S4	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share amounts): On June 15, 2009, the Company completed a public offering of 4,600,000 shares of its Class A common stock at $24.50 per share.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, 1,390,026 shares of the Company s Class B common stock were converted into 1,390,026 shares of the Company s Class A common stock in a planned sale in compliance with Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	The following total number of Class A common stock issuable under the assumed exercises of stock options computed based on the treasury stock method were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share, as the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive: Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of its United States subsidiaries.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	Each of the Company s foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in its respective country.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P57_S2	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to the Company s employees through the Company s Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective terms as directors.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P61_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P61_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment, the expected life and expected volatility of the stock.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	The expected life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P62_S2	The expected volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries were prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	Currency translation adjustments are reflected within the equity section of the balance sheet and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P68_S2	Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations upon substantial or complete liquidation of the underlying investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Risks and Uncertainties Economic activity in the United States and throughout the world has incurred and could continue to incur significant volatility and disruption.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	Certain of the Company s customers and suppliers have been directly affected by the global financial crisis and are facing credit issues and have experienced cash flow problems that have given and could continue to give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P70_S3	Continued macroeconomic volatility and disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company s statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, included the results from GWA (North) Pty Ltd (GWA North), the Company s subsidiary that acquired certain assets of FreightLink, since the acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Pursuant to the Business Sale Agreement, the Company acquired FreightLink s freight rail business between Tarcoola, South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, certain material contracts, equipment and property leases, as well as FreightLink s plant, equipment and business inventory and the assumption of debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represents the fair value of an A$50 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	As a result of the acquisition, GWA North is now the concessionaire and operator of the approximately 1,400-mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, linking the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	The rail line is located on land leased to GWA North by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation (a statutory corporation established by legislation in the Northern Territory) under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	FreightLink is both a provider of rail haulage to customers on its railroad (above rail services), as well as a track owner, charging access fees to any rail operators that run on its track (below rail services).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	The track access rights are regulated under a statutory access regime established by legislation in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company s subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), has historically operated FreightLink s rail haulage services and provided its crews, managed its train operations and also leased locomotives and wagons to FreightLink.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	As a result of the acquisition, approximately A$25 million (or $25.5 million at the December 31, 2010 exchange rate) of annual GWA non-freight revenues generated from services that have historically been provided to FreightLink will be eliminated in consolidation, but this elimination will not have any effect on operating income of the Company.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	The Company accounted for the transaction using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P74_S3	Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of FreightLink have been recorded at their respective estimated acquisition-date fair values and have been consolidated with those of the Company as of the acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P74_S4	The final determination of these estimated fair values is subject to completion of an ongoing assessment.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the preliminary balance sheet to United States dollars was $0.96 for one Australian dollar (which was the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	The preliminary acquisition-date fair values assigned to the acquired net assets were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted a new accounting standard in accordance with U.S. GAAP that changed the accounting for mergers and acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	Under the new accounting standard, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred, rather than capitalized.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P76_S2	The Company incurred $28.2 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2010, including $16.4 million related to stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P76_S3	The $28.2 million of acquisition-related costs were recorded in earnings as follows: $16.4 million within stamp duty, $11.0 million within other expenses and $0.8 million within labor and benefits.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company financed the purchase of FreightLink s assets through a combination of cash on hand and borrowing $100.0 million and A$97.0 million (or $94.0 million at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) under its Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	For a description of the material terms and conditions under the Credit Agreement, as amended, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	In June 2009, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY), intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	Consequently, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded charges of $5.4 million after-tax associated with HCRY.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	These charges reflected a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and restructuring charges of $2.3 million and were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P79_S0	In September 2010, the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario agreed to provide C$30 million (or $30 million at the December 31, 2010 exchange rate) to fund infrastructure improvements that, combined with certain customer agreements, will enable HCRY to continue operations on a long-term basis.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P79_S1	In addition, HCRY expects to fund approximately $3 million of infrastructure improvements.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P79_S2	As a result, the Company reversed $2.3 million ($1.5 million after-tax) of accrued restructuring charges related to HCRY in September 2010, as HCRY no longer intends to cease its operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	United States Ohio Central Railroad System: On October 1, 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Summit View, Inc., the parent company of 10 short line railroads known as the Ohio Central Railroad System (OCR) for cash consideration of approximately $212.6 million (net of $2.8 million cash acquired).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	In addition, the Company placed $7.5 million of contingent consideration into escrow at the acquisition date.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	This amount was paid to the seller due to the satisfaction of certain conditions and recorded as an additional cost of the acquisition in 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P80_S3	An additional $4.8 million was paid to the seller in the first quarter of 2009 to reflect adjustments for final working capital, of which $4.4 million was recorded as additional purchase price in 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P80_S4	The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company has included 100% of the value of OCR s net assets in its consolidated balance sheet since October 1, 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	In 2010, the Company recognized a gain of $8.7 million associated with a legal settlement related to the OCR acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Inc.: On October 1, 2008, the Company acquired 100% of Georgia Southwestern, Inc. (Georgia Southwestern) for cash consideration of approximately $16.5 million (net of $0.4 million cash acquired).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	An additional $0.2 million was paid to the seller in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reflect adjustments for final working capital.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	The allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	The Company has included 100% of the value of Georgia Southwestern s net assets in its consolidated balance sheet since October 1, 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	On September 29, 2009, in conjunction with its partner UniRail LLC, the Company sold substantially all of its interests in Ferroviaria Oriental S.A., which is located in Eastern Bolivia.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	The Company recorded a net gain on the sale of its investment in Bolivia of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P84_S2	The Company s portion of the sale proceeds totaled $3.9 million, against which it applied the remaining net book value of $3.4 million and direct costs of the sale of $0.1 million.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	In August of 2009, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab, S.A. de C.V. (FCCM) to Viablis, S.A. de C.V. (Viablis) for a net sale price of $2.2 million, including a deposit of $0.5 million received in November 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	Accordingly, the Company recorded a net gain of $2.2 million on the sale within discontinued operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P85_S2	In August 2010, the Company recognized a net gain of $2.8 million ($2.8 million after-tax) within discontinued operations due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to damages incurred by FCCM as a result of Hurricane Stan in 2005.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P85_S3	The Company will utilize capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset any tax on this gain.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of our remaining Mexican subsidiary, GW Servicios S.A. (Servicios), which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company does not expect any material future adverse financial impact from its remaining Mexican subsidiary.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P86_S2	See Note 20, Discontinued Operations, for additional information regarding the Company s discontinued operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	Results from Continuing Operations When comparing the Company s results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another, consider that the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to economic conditions, acquisitions, competitive forces, one-time freight moves, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, droughts, heavy snowfall, freezing and flooding.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	In periods when these events occur, results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P87_S2	Finally, certain of the Company s railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, including steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P87_S3	However, shipments of other commodities are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at a customer power plant (coal), winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (South Australian grain).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P87_S4	As a result of these and other factors, the Company s operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to its operating results in other reporting periods.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s unaudited pro forma operating results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as if the FreightLink Acquisition was consummated as of January 1, 2009 and the CAGY and OCR acquisitions were consummated as of January 1, 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S1	The following pro forma financial statements do not include the impact of any potential operating efficiencies, savings from expected synergies, costs to integrate the operations or costs necessary to achieve savings from expected synergies or the impact of derivative instruments that the Company has entered into or may enter into to mitigate interest rate or currency exchange rate risk (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): The 2010 and 2009 unaudited pro forma operating results include the FreightLink Acquisition adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the property and equipment assets based on the preliminary assignment of fair values, an adjustment to interest income for the reduction in available cash and cash equivalents due to the use of cash on hand to fund the acquisition, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to amendments to the Company s Credit Agreement, the elimination of FreightLink s deferred grant income for a liability not acquired and FreightLink s interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S2	In addition, the 2010 and 2009 unaudited pro forma operating results include an additional tax provision to report FreightLink as a tax paying entity using the Australian statutory income tax rate of 30%.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S3	The Company s 2010 results included $11.6 million of revenues and a net loss of $10.3 million from GWA North for the month of December.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S4	The $10.3 million net loss included A$11.8 million, net of tax ($11.5 million, net of tax, at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) of stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax), which was directly attributable to the acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S5	Since the pro forma financial results assume the acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2009, the 2009 unaudited pro forma operating results included A$11.8, net of tax ($8.3 million, net of tax, at the January 1, 2009 exchange rate) of stamp duty and $7.8 million, net of tax, of other FreightLink Acquisition costs.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S6	The 2010 unaudited pro forma operating results exclude A$11.8 million, net of tax ($11.5 million, net of tax, at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) of stamp duty and $7.8 million, net of tax, of other FreightLink acquisition costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S7	FreightLink s fiscal year end is June 30 and the Company s fiscal year end is December 31.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S8	Since FreightLink and the Company have different fiscal year end dates, the unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements are prepared based on comparable periods.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S9	The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, was based upon the Company s consolidated statement of operations, which includes one month of GWA North s results and the sum of FreightLink s historical quarterly statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, 2010, and two months ended November 30, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P88_S10	The foreign exchange rates used to translate FreightLink s statements of operations to United States dollars were $0.90, $0.88, $0.91 and $0.99 for one Australian dollar for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, 2010, and two months ended November 30, 2010, respectively (which were calculated based on average daily exchange rates during each of those periods).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, was based upon the Company s historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the sum of FreightLink s historical quarterly statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2009.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	The foreign exchange rates used to translate FreightLink s statements of operations to United States dollars were $0.66, $0.76, $0.83 and $0.91 for one Australian dollar for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2009, respectively (which were calculated based on average daily exchange rates during each of those periods).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	The 2008 unaudited pro forma operating results include the acquisitions of CAGY and OCR adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the property and equipment and intangible assets based on assigned values and the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	CAGY s results for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflected in these pro forma operating results include $3.5 million, net of tax, of discretionary compensation to CAGY s management that the Company does not believe would have continued as an ongoing expense but do not qualify for elimination under the treatment and presentation of pro forma financial results.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	OCR s results for the year ended December 31, 2008, reflected in these pro forma operating results include $5.3 million, net of tax, of discretionary bonuses to OCR s prior management that the Company does not believe would have continued as an ongoing expense but do not qualify for elimination under the treatment and presentation of pro forma financial results.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P90_S3	The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of the assumed dates and for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P91_S0	4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P91_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses on existing accounts receivable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P91_S2	Management determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience within each of the Company s regions.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P91_S3	Management reviews material past due balances on a monthly basis.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P91_S4	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P91_S5	Receivables consisted of the following at December 31, 2010 and 2009, which included $14.1 million resulting from the operations of GWA North for the month of December 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P92_S0	Activity in the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows (dollars in thousands): The Company s business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P92_S1	There is a risk that a customer or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations when due.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P92_S2	Customers and counterparties that owe the Company money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P92_S3	Although the Company has procedures for reviewing its receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P92_S4	Some of the Company s risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are not publicly available or otherwise accessible by the Company and this information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P92_S5	As a result, unexpected credit exposures could adversely affect the Company s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P93_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND LEASES: Property and Equipment Major classifications of property and equipment as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

1012620_11_ITEM15_P99_S1	The perpetual track access agreements on one of the Company s railroads have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and, therefore, are not subject to amortization.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P99_S2	However, these assets are tested for impairment annually or in interim periods if events indicate possible impairment.

1012620_11_ITEM15_P108_S2	Among other matters, the Credit Agreement Amendment (i) amended the definition of Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to add back acquisition costs incurred in connection with the acquisition to EBITDA in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million; (ii) amended the restrictions on indebtedness; and (iii) amended the restrictions on investments and restricted payments to permit certain intercompany obligations, investments and guarantees.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P108_S3	The Credit Agreement Amendment also changed the definition of Consolidated EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rental payments on operating leases and non-cash compensation expense) to give pro forma effect to the FreightLink Acquisition, allowed for an additional United States borrower and amended certain covenants to permit the FreightLink Acquisition and the entry into related documentation.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P108_S4	On October 15, 2010, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 and Joinder to the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement, which provided, among other things, commitments for the Company s United States and Australian borrowers to draw an additional $50 million revolving loan, which effectively increased the Company s revolving loan capacity from $300.0 million to $350.0 million.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P108_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the United States, Australian and European revolving Credit Agreement had interest rates of 2.26%, 6.85% and 2.72%, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P108_S6	The United States term loan and Canadian term loan had interest rates of 2.26% and 3.09%, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	Effective as of December 1, 2010, in each case dependent on a ratio of funded debt to EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rental payments on operating leases and non-cash compensation expense), the range of applicable margins applied to borrowings are as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	Financial covenants, which are measured on a trailing 12-month basis and calculated quarterly, are as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	a. Maximum leverage of 3.5 times, measured as Funded Debt (indebtedness plus guarantees and letters of credit by any of the borrowers, plus certain contingent acquisition purchase price amounts, plus the present value of all operating leases) to EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rental payments on operating leases and non-cash compensation expense).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	b. Minimum interest coverage of 3.5 times, measured as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) divided by interest expense.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	The financial covenant that is tested and reported annually is as follows:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	c. Capital expenditures: Generally restricts the Company from making capital expenditures in any fiscal year that exceed, in the aggregate, 20% of the net revenues of the parties of the loan for the preceding fiscal year.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P114_S1	The 20% of net revenues limitation on capital expenditures may be increased under certain conditions.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants restricting the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create certain liens, make certain investments, sell assets, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain consolidations or mergers unless under permitted acquisitions, issue subsidiary stock, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into certain modifications to certain documents such as the senior notes and make other restricted payments consisting of stock repurchases and cash dividends.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P115_S1	The Credit Agreement allows the Company to repurchase stock and pay dividends provided that the ratio of Funded Debt to EBITDAR, including any borrowings made to fund the dividend or distribution, is less than 3.0 to 1.0 but subject to certain limitations if the ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1.0.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P115_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with the provisions of the covenant requirements of its Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P115_S3	Subject to maintaining compliance with these covenants, the $192.2 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2010, is available for general corporate purposes including acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	Senior Notes In 2005, the Company completed a private placement of $100.0 million of Series B senior notes and $25.0 million of Series C senior notes.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	The Series B senior notes bear interest at 5.36% and are due in August 2015.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P116_S2	The Series C senior notes have a borrowing rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.70% and are due in August 2012.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P116_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Series C senior notes had an interest rate of 0.99%.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	In 2004, the Company completed a $75.0 million private placement of Series A senior notes.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P117_S1	The Series A senior notes bear interest at 4.85% and are due in November 2011.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P117_S2	The senior notes are unsecured but are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company s United States and Canadian subsidiaries.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P117_S3	The senior notes contain a number of covenants limiting the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, create certain liens, enter into certain consolidations or mergers and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P117_S4	Financial covenants, which must be satisfied quarterly, include (a) maximum debt to capitalization of 65% and (b) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.75 times (measured as EBITDAR for the preceding 12 months divided by interest expense plus operating lease payments for the preceding 12 months).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P117_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with the provisions of these covenants.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	The following is a summary of the maturities of long-term debt, including capital leases, as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): 8.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S1	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S2	The Company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S3	The Company does not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone, nor does the Company use derivative instruments where there are not underlying exposures.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S4	Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S5	The Company manages its hedging position and monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S6	Management believes that its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the Company s best interest.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S7	However, the Company s use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P118_S8	The Company s instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	The portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge that is offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P119_S2	As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line as the hedged item.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P119_S3	The portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P120_S1	At hedge inception and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P120_S2	When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the periods it no longer qualifies as a hedge.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	The gains or losses from the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income(expense).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P124_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P124_S2	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P124_S3	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	On October 2, 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rates on a portion of its outstanding borrowings.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P126_S1	The swap has a notional amount of $120.0 million and requires the Company to pay a fixed rate of 3.88% on the notional amount.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P126_S2	In return, the Company receives one-month LIBOR on the notional amounts of the swap, which is equivalent to the Company s variable rate obligation on the notional amounts under its Credit Agreement.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P126_S3	This swap expires on September 30, 2013.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	The Company s effectiveness testing as of December 31, 2010, resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Third-party debt related to the Company s foreign operations, $133 million, is denominated in the currency in which its subsidiaries operate, including Australia, Canada and Europe.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P129_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P129_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to the Company s debt service payments is limited.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P129_S3	However, in the event foreign currency debt service, either interest, principal amortization or repayment due at maturity in October 2013, if not refinanced, is funded from the Company s United States operations, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P129_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from the Company s United States operations to its foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P129_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P130_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P131_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P131_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P131_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income(expense).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S0	On December 1, 2010, the Company completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S1	The Company financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under its Credit Agreement, as amended.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S2	A portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to Australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of A$105.0 million (or $100.6 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S3	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan, the Company entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which Swap effectively converted the A$105.0 million loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S4	The Swap requires the Company to pay AUD BBSW plus 3.125% based on a notional amount of A$105 million and allows the Company to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.48% based on a notional amount of $100.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S5	The Company realized an expense of $0.4 million within interest income(expense) related to the quarterly settlement of the Swap for the period ended December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S6	In addition, the Company recognized a net loss of $1.0 million within other income(expense) related to the mark-to-market of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate on December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S7	This net loss was caused by a loss of $7.6 million related to the mark-to-market of the cross-currency swap and a gain of $6.6 million related to the mark-to-market of the intercompany debt.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P132_S8	Accordingly, the fair value of the cross-currency swap represented a liability of $7.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P133_S0	The fair value of the cross-currency swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 valuation inputs.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P133_S1	The Swap expires on December 1, 2012.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P134_S0	On November 24, 2010, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, with funds to be delivered on December 1, 2010, to secure an exchange rate for A$45 million of the A$331.9 million purchase of the FreightLink assets.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P134_S1	The subsequent decrease in the value of Australian dollar versus the United States dollar between November 24, 2010 and December 1, 2010 and its impact on the A$45 million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of $0.7 million within other income(expense).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P135_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P136_S0	The following table shows the effect of the Company s derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 in other comprehensive income(loss) (OCI) (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P136_S1	The following table shows the effect of the Company s derivative instruments not designated as hedges for the year ended December 31, 2010 in the consolidated statement of operations (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P137_S0	Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument held by the Company:
1012620_11_ITEM15_P139_S0	Long-term debt: Since the Company s long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available to it for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P140_S0	Derivative instruments: Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P140_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company s derivative financial instruments consisted of an interest rate swap agreement and a cross-currency swap agreement.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P140_S2	The Company estimates the fair value of its interest rate swap agreement based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P140_S3	The Company estimates the fair value of its cross-currency swap agreement based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including LIBOR implied forward interest rates, AUD BBSW implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P140_S4	The following table presents the Company s financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P141_S0	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value using Level 2 inputs of the Company s financial instruments carried at historical cost at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands): 10.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P142_S0	The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of two classes of common stock designated as Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P142_S1	The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote and 10 votes per share, respectively.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P142_S2	Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P142_S3	In addition, pursuant to the Class B Stockholders Agreement dated as of May 20, 1996, certain transfers of the Class B common stock, including transfers to persons other than our executive officers, will result in automatic conversion of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P142_S4	Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock shall have identical rights in the event of liquidation.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S0	Dividends declared by the Company s Board of Directors are payable on the outstanding shares of Class A common stock or both Class A common stock and Class B common stock, as determined by the Board of Directors.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S1	If the Board of Directors declares a dividend on both classes of stock, then the holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to receive a dividend that is 10% more than the dividend declared on each share of Class B common stock.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S2	Stock dividends declared can only be paid in shares of Class A common stock.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S3	The Company currently intends to retain all earnings to support its operations and future growth and, therefore, does not anticipate the declaration or payment of cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S4	On June 15, 2009, the Company completed a public offering of 4,600,000 shares of its Class A common stock at $24.50 per share.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S5	The Company received net proceeds of $106.6 million from the sale of its Class A common stock.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S6	The Company used the proceeds along with cash on hand to repay $108.0 million of its revolving credit facility, which represented the entire balance then outstanding.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P143_S7	The Company intends to use its cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes, including strategic investments and acquisitions.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS: Employee Bonus Programs The Company has performance-based bonus programs that include a majority of non-union employees.

1012620_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company s Canadian subsidiaries administer two different retirement benefit plans.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	Both plans qualify under Section 146 of the federal and provincial income tax law and are Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP).
1012620_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	Under each plan employees may elect to contribute a certain percentage of their salary on a pre-tax basis.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P147_S1	Under the first plan, the Company matches 5% of gross salary up to a maximum of C$1,900 (or $1,905 at the December 31, 2010 exchange rate).

1012620_11_ITEM15_P183_S4	As a result, the Company recorded a net gain of $2.2 million on the sale within discontinued operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P183_S5	The Company s Mexican operations described above are presented as discontinued operations and its results of operations are, therefore, excluded from continuing operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of Servicios were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P184_S1	The Company does not expect any material adverse financial impact from its remaining Mexican subsidiary, Servicios.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The results of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S1	Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, included a net gain of $2.8 million due to the receipt of insurance proceeds in August 2010 related to damages incurred by FCCM as a result of Hurricane Stan in 2005.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S2	The Company will utilize capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset any tax on this gain.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S3	Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, included a $2.2 million gain as a result of the sale of FCCM to Viablis, partially offset by $0.8 million of expenses related to shutting down the Mexican operations.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S4	The benefit for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily due to tax deductions identified in conjunction with the filing of the Company s 2007 United States income tax return.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S5	These tax deductions represented $0.9 million in deferred income tax assets, which were previously fully offset by a valuation allowance.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P185_S6	Accordingly, the Company reduced the related valuation allowance during the period.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P186_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements , which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P186_S1	This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P186_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations , which requires reporting entities that present comparative financial statements to present the pro forma disclosures as if the business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	The guidance also expands the supplementary pro forma disclosures to include additional disclosures describing the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P187_S2	This guidance is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P187_S3	The Company chose to early adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts , which requires reporting entities with zero or negative carrying amounts of goodwill to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	This guidance is effective for impairment tests performed during an entity s fiscal year, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010.
1012620_11_ITEM15_P188_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1012620_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	The global economy, which experienced a significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009 that included widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, began to improve in 2010.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	While some economic indicators have trended positively, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2011 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	The recent economic improvements may not be broad-based and sustainable and may not enhance conditions in the markets relevant to us.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	For instance, in Australia a significant portion of the commodities we transport are supporting economic growth and industrial development in Asia, and a sustained slowdown in these markets could impact us.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P1_S4	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact our customers, our suppliers and our business in general.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	We are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from economic activity and industrialization in developing countries could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P2_S3	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with partners.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past; principally through the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	We may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future, or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P5_S4	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P5_S5	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Since January 1, 1996, we have acquired interests in 57 railroads, all of which were purchased for cash.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , we had $27.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $227.2 million of undrawn revolver capacity available for acquisitions or other activities, subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P6_S7	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our inability to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	We may not be able to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	Evaluating acquisition targets gives rise to additional costs related to legal, financial, operating and industry due diligence.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S4	In addition, acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and, to the extent financed with debt, additional interest costs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S5	Integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant restructuring costs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P7_S6	The process of acquiring businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	the diversion of management s attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	The expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on extensive analyses.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	These analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, operating costs and competitive factors, most of which are beyond our control and may not materialize.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	While we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	Also, the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P9_S5	Finally, the physical conditions of the assets acquired may not be sufficient to support the operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our results of operations and rail structure are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the Northeastern United States and Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States and Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment or other substantial disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	Even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations, it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the Northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States, which lessen demand for coal.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our revenues generated by our Australian operations are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the South Australian grain harvest and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the Northern Territory.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the Northern United States and Canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Such weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	In the United States, these agencies include the STB, DOT, FRA of the DOT, OSHA, DHS and other federal agencies and state departments of transportation.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	In Australia, we are subject to both Commonwealth and state regulations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	In Canada, we are subject to regulation by the CTA, TC and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of Quebec and Ontario.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, the Transport, Public Works and Water Management Inspectorate and the Dutch railways managers, ProRail and Keyrail.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations, which is currently hosted by FPS Mobility and Transport, and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	Business Regulation for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P19_S5	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	There are various legislative and regulatory actions being considered in the United States, including legislation proposed in the Senate in January 2011 that would modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry and various proceedings that have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition and competitive access and legislation proposed in the House of Representatives in 2012 that would modify limitations on truck size and weight.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, specific initiatives being considered by Congress and the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	Significant legislative or regulatory activity could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our credit agreement and note purchase agreement contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our credit agreement and note purchase agreement contain numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
1012620_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our credit agreement and note purchase agreement also contain financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our failure to comply with the obligations in our credit agreement and note purchase agreement could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the credit agreement or note purchase agreement, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	For interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	When we are the invoicing railroad, therefore, we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and we are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S4	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S5	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S6	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular those in the mining and natural resources industry, before the customer commences operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S7	In those cases, we may be exposed to start-up risks that we would not be exposed to in respect of customers with active operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P24_S8	As a result, unexpected credit exposures or start-up delays could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our operations served more than 840 freight customers in 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Freight revenues from our 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 24% of our total revenues in 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	Six of our 10 largest freight customers in 2011 were located in Australia and accounted for approximately 16% of our total revenues.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	In 2011 , our largest freight customer was a company in the farm and food products industry and represented approximately 5% of our total revenues.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	In Australia, a number of our customer contracts contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the variable portion based on the volumes shipped.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	In 2011 , approximately 86% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	The quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P30_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	Deterioration in the operations of or service provided by those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	For instance, we lease several railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under long-term lease arrangements, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 8% of our 2011 total revenues.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, we own several railroads that also lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	In addition, competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S5	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S6	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S7	Also, commodities we transport by rail could be substituted for another commodity that is not transported by rail.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S8	For example, coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S9	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S10	The extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S11	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S12	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S13	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S14	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S15	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P35_S16	For information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, see Additional Risks Associated with our Foreign Operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Market and regulatory responses to climate change and climate change itself could adversely affect our operating costs and decrease demand for the commodities we transport.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	Clean air laws, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S4	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S5	Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S6	Any of these factors, including climate change and the impact of global warming, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S7	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S8	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S9	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P36_S10	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned or operated by us.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	Environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs, including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	We design our operating plan to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	For instance, recently enacted legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S5	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S6	We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S7	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S8	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S9	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S10	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P39_S11	We have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	On certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are commingled with passenger trains.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	For instance, in Oregon we operate certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon over our Portland Western Railroad.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed expected statutory limits, third-party insurance limits and our insurance limits.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	In addition, deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property casualties and subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims expenses and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The United States short line tax credit expired on December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate in 2012 will be higher if the credit is not extended.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States short line tax credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of their tax year.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	In 2011 and 2010, the Short Line Tax Credit lowered our effective tax rate by 6.5% and 9.3% , respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S4	The most recent extension of the Short Line Tax Credit only extended the credit through December 31, 2011.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S5	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, the loss of the credit will increase our effective tax rate and reduce our reported earnings per share.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P42_S6	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate such risks could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	While these financial instruments reduce the Company s exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit the Company s ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	We consumed 26.1 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	An increase in diesel fuel costs could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	Although we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset rising fuel prices, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 14% and 9% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P46_S6	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our ability to obtain government funding.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	During 2011 , we obtained government funding for 53 separate projects that were partially or completely funded by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 18% of our total capital expenditures during 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S5	In addition, competition for government funding from other short line railroads, Class I railroads and other companies is significant, and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S6	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations, such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S7	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S8	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S9	We are a party to 39 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and Belgium.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P47_S10	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 10 of those agreements.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	Approximately 945 of our 2,620 full time employees are union members.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	We have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional 125 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S4	If such Class I railroads were to have a work stoppage or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S5	To date, we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S6	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S7	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S8	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P49_S9	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 15% of the current workforce will become eligible for retirement.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S2	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S3	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S4	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S5	Finally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S6	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S7	Our ability to manage all of these risks is further complicated by the geographic diversity of our operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S8	If any of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our profit margins could decrease and our growth strategy could be impaired.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S9	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain rail cars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S10	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as rail cars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P50_S11	If the number of available rail cars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these rail cars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain rail cars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	As of January 1, 2012 , according to the AAR, approximately 18% of the North American railcar fleet was in storage.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	In some cases we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S4	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S5	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S6	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S7	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P51_S8	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	FELA s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker s compensation system.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe accounted for 33% , 8% , and 2% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe accounted for 32% , 7% and 1% of our long-lived assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P57_S4	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be cancelled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	If our concession agreement or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider, but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P60_S4	Further, the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P60_S5	Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Netherlands and Belgium also have open access regime that permits third-party rail operators to compete for RRF s business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S3	The loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S4	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S5	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S6	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P62_S7	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	Continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in Australia is a requirement under our concession deeds.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P64_S2	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal and expiration.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P64_S3	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational performance and financial results.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P64_S4	Changes to the mining tax regime in Australia could have a negative impact on our existing customers and the prospects for new customer initiatives underway.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	On May 2, 2010, the Australian Government announced its intention to introduce a Resource Super Profits Tax (RSPT).
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	On July 2, 2010, the Australian Government announced that it proposes to replace the RSPT with a new Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT).
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	The MRRT would apply to Australian entities iron ore and coal projects after July 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S3	The MMRT passed the Australian house of representatives on November 23, 2011 and is expected to be considered by the Australian senate in 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S4	In the event that such a tax is implemented, this could result in an increase in operating costs for mining assets based in Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S5	The tax could also have an adverse effect on our Australian operations by reducing the volume of commodities mined in Australia for us to transport, as well as by reducing levels of demand for Australian commodities and our transportation of those commodities.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S6	Consequently, the introduction of the MRRT could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S7	Australia recognizes a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of indigenous inhabitants to their traditional lands, which could impact our GWA North operations.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S8	There are a number of native title claims registered with the National Native Title Tribunal that could give rise to native title rights on discrete parcels of land over which we operate.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S9	While no native title claims have been made against lots associated with our business to date, there is a risk that a claim could be made that native title exists.
1012620_12_ITEM1_P65_S10	A successful claim could prevent or limit our use of the land or require us to make payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 7,600 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line that we operate under a concession agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also operate, through various trackage rights agreements, over 1,405 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	The track miles listed below exclude 929 miles of sidings and yards located in the United States ( 777 miles), Canada ( 87 miles) and Australia ( 65 miles), as well as track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2011 , with respect to our railroads:
1012620_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	(1) See Legend of Connecting Carriers following this table.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	(3) In addition, RSR has haulage contracts over 52 miles of NS that are terminable at will and 70 miles of CSX that expire in 2013.

1012620_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	If the lease terminates, UP is obligated to reimburse us for leasehold improvements, subject to certain limitations.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P2_S3	In addition, WPRR operates over 41 miles of UP under a concurrent trackage rights agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P2_S4	(9) Includes more than four miles under lease with POTB expiring in 2012 and 60 miles under lease with UP expiring in 2015 with a 10-year renewal unless terminated by either party.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P2_S5	If the lease terminates, UP is obligated to reimburse us for pre-approved leasehold improvements, subject to certain limitations.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	Includes over 76 miles under lease with BNSF, expiring in 2017.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S1	If the lease terminates, BNSF is obligated to reimburse us for leasehold improvements, subject to certain limitations.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S2	In addition, PNWR operates by trackage rights over two miles of UP expiring in 2015 and three miles under temporary agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S3	PNWR also has haulage contracts over 49 miles of UP, 13 miles of BNSF and two miles of Portland Terminal Railroad Company (PTR), expiring in 2016, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S4	Includes 56 miles and 92 miles operated pursuant to a perpetual rail service easement from the State of Oregon.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S5	In addition, IMR operates by perpetual trackage rights over 15 miles of CN.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S6	IMR also operates by trackage rights over nine miles of TZPR and 48 miles of UP that expire in 2024 and 2099, respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM2_P3_S7	(12) Includes 12.5 miles of previously leased rail line, which was purchased from NS in April 2008 and five miles under lease from the State of Virginia expiring in 2109.

1012620_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	On December 1, 2010, we acquired $320.0 million of net assets from FreightLink.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	In 2010, we incurred $28.2 million of acquisition-related expenses charged to earnings related to this transaction.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	In addition, we reversed $2.3 million of accrued restructuring expense related to our Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY).
1012620_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	In addition, with respect to HCRY, we recorded a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and $2.3 million of restructuring expense, which were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	(4) In 2008, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Summit View, Inc., the parent company of 10 short line railroads known as the Ohio Central Railway System (OCR) with net assets of $227.8 million; CAGY Industries, Inc., the parent company of three short line railroads, with net assets of $107.2 million; Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V. in the Netherlands with net assets of $23.6 million; and Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Inc. with net assets of $17.1 million.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P3_S2	(5) In 2007, we acquired 87.4% of Maryland Midland Railway, Inc. with net assets of $30.7 million.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P3_S3	Also in 2007, we ceased our Mexican rail operations and initiated formal liquidation proceedings of FCCM, our wholly owned Mexican subsidiary.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P3_S4	As a result of our formal notification to the Secretaria de Communicaciones y Transportes (SCT) of our intent to exercise our right to resign our Mexican operations, the SCT seized substantially all of our Mexican operating assets.
1012620_12_ITEM6_P3_S5	As a result of these and other actions, we recorded a $25.4 million loss from discontinued operations in 2007, partially offset by a United States tax benefit of $11.3 million, primarily related to a worthless stock and bad debt deductions to be claimed in the United States.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Outlook for 2012 Safety Operating safe railroads benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	We have led the railroad industry in safety for the past three years and our goal for 2012 is to continue this trend.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	A reduction of grade crossing incidents is also an important aspect of our safety programs, and we remain actively involved in this effort through our participation in Operation Lifesaver in the communities where we operate.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We expect the North American and Australian economies to be relatively stable in 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	We expect the European economy to be somewhat weaker.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We expect our revenues to increase due to the full year impact of the Arizona Eastern Railway acquisition and growth in same railroad freight revenues.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	However, during the first quarter of 2012 we expect the same railroad revenues to be negatively impacted by the Edith River Derailment and the interruptions in service on the Adelaide to Darwin corridor.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	We maintain insurance for damages and claims associated with the Edith River Derailment and expect our insurance recovery to reimburse a portion of the lost revenues and associated expenses during the remainder of 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	Specifically, we expect same railroad freight revenues to increase in 2012 primarily due to higher average revenues per carload as a result of (1) increases in North American rail pricing, (2) the current strength of the Australian and Canadian dollars versus the United States dollar and (3) increases in fuel surcharges as a result of higher fuel prices.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	Finally, we anticipate the start up of a new iron ore contract with Southern Iron in the fourth quarter of 2012 that should contribute approximately $50 million annually in revenue when the customer begins to ship at full capacity.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	We anticipate same railroad carload volumes will be relatively flat year over year as growth across most commodity groups is offset by a decline in coal traffic.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	During the first half of 2012, coal traffic is expected to decline primarily due to a combination of warm winter weather in the United States, low natural gas prices and temporary outages at two of the coal fired power plants we serve for repairs and upgrades.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	In addition, repairs associated with the Edith River Derailment will be ongoing during the first quarter of 2012, which will negatively impact our carload volumes in Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect same railroad non-freight revenues to be relatively flat in 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	We expect higher industrial and port terminal switching revenues, but we expect same railroad demurrage and storage income to decline, primarily due to fewer third-party cars stored on our railroads.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	We also closed our drayage (trucking) business in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	We expect same railroad operating expenses to increase in 2012 primarily due to four factors.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	First, we expect an increase in transportation expense due to the expansion of our business in Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Second, we expect that diesel fuel expense will be higher in 2012 than in 2011 due to higher fuel prices.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Third, we anticipate higher depreciation expense in 2012 due to the higher levels of our capital spending in recent years.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Fourth, we expect higher operating expenses as a result of the current strength of the Australian and Canadian dollar and the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	Overall, we believe our operating income will increase in 2012 as a result of the growth in our same railroad revenues and contributions from acquisitions.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P4_S5	Further, we expect the final delivery of new high horsepower locomotives in the second quarter of 2012 to increase our operating efficiency.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	United States Short Line Tax Credit The United States Short Line Tax Credit expired on December 31, 2011.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	In 2011, the Short Line Tax Credit lowered our effective tax rate by 6.5%.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	Bipartisan support for an extension of the Short Line Tax Credit exists, but the likelihood of a retroactive extension of the tax credit in 2012 is uncertain.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	We expect to make capital investments totaling approximately $134 million in 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	Of this total, approximately $76 million is planned for same railroad track and equipment improvements, approximately $13 million is planned for track and equipment expenditures on our newly acquired properties and approximately $9 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	business development related capital, primarily new locomotives for Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	In addition, we operate the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Operations currently include 65 railroads organized into 10 regions, with approximately 7,600 miles of owned and leased track and 1,405 additional miles under track access arrangements.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	In addition, we provide rail service at 17 ports in North America and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	In 2011 and 2010, we completed the acquisition of the Arizona and Eastern Railway Company (AZER) in the United States and the acquisition of FreightLink in Australia, respectively, in each case described in more detail below.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	Income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2011 was $119.5 million , compared with income from continuing operations of $78.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	Our diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders in the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2.79 with 42.8 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders of $1.88 with 41.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S5	Operating revenues increased $198.9 million , or 31.6% , to $829.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $630.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P7_S6	The increase in our operating revenues included $141.8 million in net revenues from new operations and an $82.9 million , or 13.2% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	When we discuss either revenues from existing operations or same railroad revenues, we are referring to the change in our revenues, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Operating income in the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $61.4 million , or 47.1% , to $191.8 million , compared with $130.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our operating ratio was 76.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with an operating ratio of 79.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Our operating income in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included certain significant items that are set forth below (dollars in millions): Significant items:
1012620_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011 we generated $173.5 million in cash from operating activities from continuing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	During the same period, we purchased $178.7 million of property and equipment, including $78.2 million for the investment in new Australian equipment, and we paid $89.9 million in net cash for acquisitions.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	These payments were partially offset by $22.6 million in cash received largely from government grants as well as other outside parties for capital spending and $9.5 million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Changes in Operations United States On September 1, 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of AZER.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We paid the seller $89.5 million in cash at closing, which included a reduction in purchase price of $0.6 million for the estimated working capital adjustment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Based on the final working capital adjustment, we recorded an additional $0.8 million of purchase price in December 2011, which was paid to the seller in January 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	We incurred $0.6 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2011 , which were expensed as incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	The results from AZER s operations have been included in our statement of operations since September 1, 2011 and are included in our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Headquartered near Miami, Arizona, with 43 employees and 10 locomotives, AZER owns and operates two rail lines totaling approximately 200 track miles in southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico that are connected by 52 miles of trackage rights over the Union Pacific Railroad.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The largest customer on AZER is Freeport-McMoRan Copper Gold Inc.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	AZER provides rail service to Freeport-McMoRan s largest North American copper mine and its North American smelter, hauling copper concentrate, copper anode, copper rod and sulfuric acid.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	In conjunction with the transaction, AZER and Freeport-McMoRan have entered into a long-term operating agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	On December 1, 2010, through our subsidiary, GWA (North) Pty Ltd (GWA North), we completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A $331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The results of operations for GWA North have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Pursuant to the Business Sale Agreement, we acquired FreightLink s freight rail business between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, certain material contracts, equipment and property leases, as well as FreightLink s plant, equipment and business inventory.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	In addition, as part of the acquisition, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A $1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represents the fair value of an A $50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	As a result of the acquisition, GWA North is now the concessionaire and operator of the approximately 1,400-mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	The rail line is located on land leased to GWA North by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation (a statutory corporation established by legislation in the Northern Territory) under a concession agreement that expires in 2054 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	GWA North is both a provider of rail haulage to customers on its railroad (above rail services), as well as a track access provider, charging access fees to any rail operators that run on its track (below rail services).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The track access rights are regulated under a statutory access regime established by legislation in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), historically operated FreightLink s rail haulage services, provided its crews, managed its train operations and leased locomotives and wagons to FreightLink.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	As a result of the acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2011 , $33.9 million of GWA non-freight revenues generated from services that have historically been provided to FreightLink were eliminated in consolidation, but this elimination did not have any effect on our operating income.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Prior to the completion of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line in 2004, potential mining projects located in the Northern Territory had no economically viable transportation link to an export port.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Since the completion of the rail line, there has been an increase in mineral exploration and development in the Northern Territory and South Australia along the rail corridor.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	We believe the FreightLink Acquisition provides us significant organic growth opportunities as it positions us to capitalize on future mineral development in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	We financed the purchase of FreightLink s assets through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings of $100.0 million and A $97.0 million (or $94.0 million at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) under the United States and Australian revolving loans, respectively, of our credit agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	For a description of the material terms and conditions under our credit agreement, see the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	In June 2009, we announced that our subsidiary, Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY), intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Consequently, in the second quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $5.4 million after-tax associated with HCRY.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	These charges reflected a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and restructuring expenses of $2.3 million and were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	In September 2010, the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario agreed to provide C $30 million (or $29 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) to fund infrastructure improvements that, combined with certain customer agreements, will enable HCRY to continue operations on a long-term basis.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	In addition, HCRY committed to fund approximately C $3 million (or $3 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) for infrastructure improvements.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	As a result, we reversed $2.3 million ( $1.5 million after-tax) of accrued restructuring expenses related to HCRY in September 2010, as HCRY no longer intends to cease its operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Because of the substance of the temporary agreement HCRY was operating under from August 15, 2009 through December 31, 2010, HCRY s net operating earnings were included within non-freight revenues as other operating income.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	On January 1, 2011, HCRY began operating under a new agreement with certain customers.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Because of the substance of the new arrangement, on January 1, 2011, we resumed reporting HCRY s operating revenues, including freight revenues and corresponding carloads, and operating expenses within each respective line item of our statement of operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	South America On September 29, 2009, in conjunction with our partner, UniRail LLC, we sold substantially all of our interests in Ferroviaria Oriental S.A., which is located in Eastern Bolivia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	We recorded a net gain on the sale of our investment in Bolivia of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Our portion of the sale proceeds totaled $3.9 million, against which we applied the remaining net book value of $3.4 million and direct costs of the sale of $0.1 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Purchase Price Allocation We accounted for the AZER and FreightLink acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of AZER and FreightLink have been recorded at their respective acquisition-date fair values and have been consolidated with those of GWI as of their respective acquisition dates.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the FreightLink balance sheet to United States dollars was $0.96 for one Australian dollar (which was the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The acquisition-date fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of AZER and FreightLink were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Discontinued Operations In August 2009, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of our Mexican operating subsidiary, Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab, S.A. de C.V. (FCCM) to Viablis, S.A. de C.V. for a net sale price of $2.2 million, including the deposit of $0.5 million received in November 2008.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Accordingly, we recorded a net gain of $2.2 million on the sale within discontinued operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	In August 2010, we recognized income from net insurance proceeds of $2.8 million ($2.8 million after-tax) in discontinued operations related to damage incurred by FCCM as a result of Hurricane Stan in 2005.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	We utilized capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset the tax on this gain.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of our remaining Mexican subsidiary, GW Servicios S.A., which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	We do not expect any material future adverse financial impact from our remaining Mexican subsidiary.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Results from Continuing Operations When comparing our results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another, consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to economic conditions, acquisitions, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably warm or cool weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	In periods when these events occur, results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	However, shipments of other commodities are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at customer plants (coal), winter weather (salt and coal) and seasonal rainfall (South Australian grain).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	As a result of these and other factors, our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010 Operating Revenues Overview Operating revenues were $829.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $630.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $198.9 million or 31.6% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The $198.9 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $141.8 million in revenues from new operations and an $82.9 million , or 13.2% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	New operations are those that were not included in our consolidated financial results for a comparable period in the prior year.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	On a consolidated basis, results from new operations reflected the elimination of $25.8 million of non-freight revenues for services provided to GWA North by GWA.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	The $82.9 million increase in revenues from existing operations included increases of $56.7 million in freight revenues and $26.2 million in non-freight revenues.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	The $82.9 million increase in revenues from existing operations included $26.5 million due to a 6.3% increase in carloads, $17.8 million due to an increase in railcar switching revenues, $10.1 million due to an increase in fuel surcharge revenues, $3.8 million due to an increase in fuel sales to third parties and a benefit of $16.2 million from the impact of foreign currency appreciation.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	The following table breaks down our operating revenues and total carloads into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following table compares freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands, except average freight revenues per carload):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Total freight traffic increased by 133,326 carloads, or 15.4% , in 2011 compared with 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Carloads from existing operations increased by 54,145 carloads, or 6.3% , and new operations contributed 79,181 carloads.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	Average freight revenues per carload increased 28.9% to $585 in 2011 compared with 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	Average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 7.7% to $489 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	The impact on average freight revenues per carload driven by changes in the intermodal and metallic ores commodity groups were primarily the result of new operations acquired from FreightLink, which have a relatively longer length of haul than our other operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S5	The increase in average freight revenues per carload from existing operations included a 2.0% benefit from the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S6	In addition, higher fuel surcharges and changes in the commodity mix increased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S7	Other than the impacts from these factors, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 3.1%.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P29_S8	The following table sets forth freight revenues by commodity group segregated into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in freight revenues by commodity group from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates, fuel surcharges, appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Coal and coke revenues increased $3.2 million , or 4.4% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	Average freight revenues per carload increased 2.7%, which increased revenues by $1.9 million, and coal and coke traffic volume increased 3,494 carloads, or 1.7%, which increased revenues by $1.3 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	The carload increase was primarily due to increased demand for coal and the return of traffic to power plants that had maintenance and construction-related outages in 2010.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	Farm and food products revenues increased $11.5 million , or 20.6% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S6	Farm and food products traffic volume increased 14,485 carloads, or 13.3%, which increased revenues by $7.9 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 6.4%, which increased revenues by $3.6 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S7	The carload increase was primarily due to an increase in export grain traffic in Australia and an increase in grain traffic in the midwestern United States.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S8	The increase in average freight revenues per carload included a benefit of $4.4 million due to the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S9	This benefit was partially offset by a decrease in average freight revenues per carload of 1.4%, which decreased revenues by $0.8 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S10	Because rates for Australian grain traffic have both a fixed and variable component, the increase in Australian grain traffic resulted in lower average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P30_S11	Pulp and paper revenues increased $7.7 million , or 14.3% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The carload increase was primarily due to higher pulpboard traffic in the southeastern United States and 2,730 carloads from HCRY.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	Metals revenues increased $12.8 million , or 34.8% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Metals traffic volumes increased 12,495 carloads, or 16.4%, which increased revenues by $7.0 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 15.8%, which increased revenues by $5.8 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	The carload increase was primarily due to 8,623 carloads from HCRY and an increase in carloads due to the expansion of a plant we serve in the southeastern United States, partially offset by a decrease in carloads due to start-up issues and low carbon steel demand at a plant we serve in the northeastern United States and truck competition at another plant we serve in the northeastern United States .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	Minerals and stone revenues increased $6.9 million , or 16.9% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S5	Minerals and stone average freight revenues per carload increased 8.9%, which increased revenues by $3.7 million, and traffic volumes increased 9,305 carloads, or 7.2%, which increased revenues by $3.2 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S6	The increase in average freight revenues per carload included a benefit of $1.5 million due to the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S7	The carload increase was primarily due to the expansion of a plant we serve, an increase in rock salt shipments due to restocking of stockpiles in the northeastern United States and the general improvement in the economy.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S8	Chemicals and plastics revenues increased $4.5 million , or 11.6% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S9	Average freight revenues per carload increased 7.3%, which increased revenues by $2.8 million, and chemicals and plastics traffic volumes increased 2,318 carloads, or 4.1%, which increased revenues by $1.7 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S10	The carload increase was primarily due to the general improvement in the economy.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S11	Lumber and forest products revenues increased $2.7 million , or 9.4% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S12	Lumber and forest products average freight revenues per carload increased 6.6%, which increased revenues by $1.9 million, and traffic volumes increased 1,567 carloads, or 2.5%, which increased revenues by $0.8 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S13	Petroleum products revenues increased $2.8 million , or 13.6% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S14	Petroleum products average freight revenues per carload increased 11.7%, which increased revenues by $2.4 million, and traffic volumes increased 513 carloads, or 1.8%, which increased revenues by $0.4 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S15	Other freight revenues increased $2.7 million , or 14.2% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S16	Average freight revenues per carload increased 9.7%, which increased revenues by $1.9 million, and other traffic volumes increased 3,172 carloads, or 4.0%, which increased revenues by $0.8 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S17	Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined increased by $1.7 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P31_S18	The following table compares non-freight revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table sets forth non-freight revenues by new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	In order to compare our non-freight revenues from existing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 to our total operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 , the 2011 existing operations data includes $25.8 million of non-freight revenues for services provided to GWA North by GWA for the 11-month period ended November 30, 2011, which were eliminated in our consolidated results.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in non-freight revenues from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Railcar switching revenues increased $17.8 million , or 16.1% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	The increase included an $8.7 million increase in industrial switching revenues primarily as a result of new and expanded customer service contracts, a $5.5 million increase in port switching revenues primarily due to an increase in export grain and intermodal container traffic at our United States port operations, as well as new customer shipments in the Port of Rotterdam, and a $3.7 million benefit due to the impact from the change in foreign currency.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S3	Car hire and rental income revenues increased $4.4 million , or 18.2% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S4	The increase included a $1.5 million benefit from the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar and an increase in car hire income resulting from increased carload traffic in North America.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S5	Fuel sales to third parties increased $3.8 million , or 20.1% , of which $4.0 million resulted from a 21.4% increase in the average price per gallon, partially offset by $0.2 million from a 1.0% decrease in gallons sold.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S6	Demurrage and storage revenues decreased $2.3 million , or 9.5% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S7	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of third-party rail cars being stored.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S8	Car repair services revenues increased $0.9 million , or 12.5% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S9	Other non-freight revenues increased $1.7 million , or 3.1% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S10	The increase included a benefit of $3.5 million due to the impact from the change in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease of $1.9 million primarily due to presenting HCRY's operating expenses as a direct offset within its operating revenues in 2010.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S11	Operating Expenses Overview Operating expenses were $637.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $499.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $137.5 million , or 27.5% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S12	The increase in operating expenses was attributable to $102.8 million from new operations and $60.5 million from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S13	The appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar resulted in a $12.0 million increase in operating expenses from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S14	Labor and benefits expense from existing operations increased $18.7 million primarily due to the hiring of new employees and increased overtime costs, which resulted primarily from increased traffic volumes, and annual wage and benefit increases in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P33_S15	Operating expenses from existing operations were adversely affected by a $16.2 million increase in the price of diesel fuel, all or a substantial portion of which will be recovered through fuel surcharges and rate changes.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Operating expenses from existing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 also included $10.5 million from HCRY that were not in the year ended December 31, 2010 due to presenting HCRY's operating expenses as a direct offset within its operating revenues in 2010.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	On a consolidated basis, results from new operations reflect the elimination of $25.8 million of operating expenses for GWA related to services provided to GWA North.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Operating Ratio Our operating ratio, defined as total operating expenses divided by total operating revenues, improved to 76.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 from 79.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	While changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a material impact on our operating revenues and operating expenses, they should not have a material impact on our operating ratio.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	The following table sets forth a comparison of our operating expenses in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Labor and benefits expense was $236.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $207.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $28.4 million , or 13.7% , of which $23.9 million was from existing operations and $4.6 million was from new operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase from existing operations consisted of $6.5 million due to an increase in the average number of employees, approximately $5.5 million of benefit increases (primarily United States health care costs), $5.2 million due to the impact from the change in foreign currency exchange rates, $4.0 million from HCRY, $3.0 million from annual wage increases and $2.7 million from an increase in overtime costs.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $3.0 million in performance-based bonus awards.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 65 employees compared with our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2010 .

1012620_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase was primarily attributable to $19.9 million from new operations, partially offset by the elimination of $7.0 million of expenses incurred by GWA related to services provided to GWA North and a decrease of $1.4 million from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	The decrease from existing operations included $2.2 million from reductions in locomotive and freight car rents in Europe and Canada and property rents in Australia, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase due to the impact from the change in foreign currency exchange rates.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Purchased services expense, which consists of the costs of services provided by outside contractors for repairs and maintenance of track property, locomotives, freight cars and other equipment as well as contract labor costs for crewing and drayage services, was $78.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $52.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $26.5 million , or 50.8% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase was attributable to $35.6 million from new operations and a $4.8 million increase from existing operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The increase from existing operations included $3.4 million due to the impact from the change in foreign currency exchange rates.

1012620_12_ITEM7_P71_S5	The senior notes contain a number of covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, create certain liens, enter into certain consolidations or mergers and enter into certain transactions with affiliates.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P71_S6	Financial covenants, which must be satisfied quarterly, include, among others, (a) maximum debt to capitalization of 65% and (b) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.75 times (measured as EBITDAR for the preceding 12 months divided by interest expense plus operating lease payments for the preceding 12 months).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P71_S7	As of December 31, 2011 , we were in compliance with these covenants.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	In 2004, we completed a $75.0 million private placement of Series A senior notes.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Series A senior notes bore interest at 4.85% and matured in November 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	On November 1, 2011, we repaid the $75.0 million of senior notes through $67.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Agreement and $8.0 million from cash and cash equivalents.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	In 2010, as part of the FreightLink Acquisition, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A $1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A $50.0 million (or $51.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2011) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the carrying value of the loan was $2.0 million with an effective interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for rail cars, locomotives and other equipment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , we leased 10,315 rail cars and 21 locomotives.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Related operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $19.0 million , $13.1 million and $12.6 million , respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 of $4.6 million , $5.0 million and $4.6 million , respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	In 2011 , we purchased certain leased locomotive assets for $0.5 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers to operate over various rail lines in North America.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	Under certain other of these leases, no payments to the lessors are required as long as certain operating conditions are met.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	No material payments were required under these lease agreements in 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties (e.g., customers) for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P76_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the Credit Agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments that could affect our financial condition.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	(3) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swap of $7.0 million and the fair value of our cross-currency swap of $7.2 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	(4) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	(5) Includes deferred compensation of $7.2 million , estimated casualty obligations of $2.0 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $1.5 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	In addition, the table includes estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $3.6 million and our 2012 estimated contributions of $0.1 million to our pension plans.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011 consist of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses When comparing the effects on revenues of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2011 versus the year ended December 31, 2010 , foreign currency translation had a positive impact on our consolidated revenues due to the strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Since the world s major crude oil and refined products are traded in United States dollars, we believe there was little, if any, impact of foreign currency translation on our fuel sales to third parties in Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	Currency effects related to operating revenues and expenses are presented within the discussion of these respective items included within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to such estimates in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	We account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P85_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P85_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	Major renewals or improvements, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge s capacity to carry increased loading and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	As a result, we typically incur minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P89_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P89_S4	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment, since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year, and no impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	We first compare the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including our assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S4	Our primary liability policies have self-insured retentions of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S5	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S6	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S7	Accruals for FELA claims by our railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P101_S8	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	Our property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for grants to our employees under our Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P103_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P103_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	The assumption for the life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on historical and implied volatility.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.7 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $8.9 million , which will be recognized over the next three years with a weighted average period of 1.2 years.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.1 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2009 , compensation cost from equity awards was $6.5 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	In our consolidated balance sheets, these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	A deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards, is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, our deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 was $155.4 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Other Uncertainties Our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward-looking statements.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	For a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations, see Part 1.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject, and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented.
1012620_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Risk Sensitivity Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	(1) Includes an A $50.0 million (or $51.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2011) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 assumed in the FreightLink Acquisition with a carrying value of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2011 with an effective interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using United States LIBOR, Australia BBSW, Canadian LIBOR and Euro LIBOR (as of December 31, 2011 ).
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 1.50% for United States, Australian, Canadian and European borrowings under our Credit Agreement and 0.70% for our Series C senior notes.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $4.0 million .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Furthermore, if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment, we believe we would incur interest rates no worse, and potentially better, than our current rates.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We apply the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value:
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Since our long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, the future interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	These agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	Management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income (loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	On October 2, 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The swap has a notional amount of $120.0 million and requires us to pay 3.88% on the notional amount and allows us to receive one-month LIBOR.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P11_S2	This swap expires on September 30, 2013.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 valuation inputs.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The fair value of the interest rate swap represented a liability of $7.0 million as of December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The one-month LIBOR was set at 0.27% at December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2011, $181.8 million of third-party debt related to our foreign operations was denominated in the currency of the countries in which our subsidiaries operate, including Australia, Canada and Europe.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P13_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P13_S3	However, in the event foreign currency debt service, either interest, principal amortization or repayment due at maturity in July 2016 , if not refinanced, is funded from our United States operations, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P13_S4	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from our United States operations to our foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P14_S0	From time to time, we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P14_S1	To mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P15_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P16_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P16_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income(expense).
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S0	On December 1, 2010, we completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A $331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S1	We financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S2	A portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to Australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of A $105.0 million (or $100.6 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S3	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan, we entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A $105.0 million loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S4	The Swap requires us to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.125% based on a notional amount of A $105.0 million and allows us to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.48% based on a notional amount of $100.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S5	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, we realized a net expense of $5.9 million within interest (expense)/income related to the quarterly settlements of the Swap for the period ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S6	In addition, we recognized a net gain of $0.2 million within other income/(expense) related to the mark-to-market of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate on December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P17_S7	The fair value of the cross-currency swap represented a current liability of $7.2 million as of December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P18_S0	The fair value of the cross-currency swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 valuation inputs.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P18_S1	The Swap expires on December 1, 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The following table summarizes the impact of these foreign currency financial instruments on our statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P20_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P20_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2011 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 13.9% of our total expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P20_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P20_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_12_ITEM7A_P20_S4	As of December 31, 2011 , each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $0.9 million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company s internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company s Audit Committee.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2011 , we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_12_ITEM9A_P4_S3	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report which is included herein under Part IV.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Genesee Wyoming Inc.:
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and changes in equity and comprehensive income present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P36_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Through its subsidiaries, the Company owns and operates short line and regional freight railroads and provides rail car switching and ancillary rail services.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	In addition, the Company also operates a railroad that runs approximately 1,400 miles between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	A large portion of the Company s operating revenues is attributable to industrial customers operating in the electricity generation, farm and food products and paper and forest products industries.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	Freight revenues from the Company s 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 24% , 22% and 21% of the Company s operating revenues in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Revenue Recognition Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company s tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies consist of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	Materials and supplies are removed from inventory using the average cost method.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company accounts for businesses it acquires using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company records the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	As part of this process, the Company identifies and attributes values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P51_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P51_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company s short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P55_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company s major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	When factors indicate that assets may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P58_S3	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 or 2009 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment review as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company s assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company is required to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the the facility served, customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims The Company maintains property and liability insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company s primary liability policies have a self-insured retention of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company s liability policies.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P66_S4	Accruals for Federal Employment Liability Act (FELA) claims by the Company s railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P66_S5	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company s property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Earnings per Share Common shares issuable under unexercised stock options calculated under the treasury stock method and weighted average Class B common shares outstanding are the only reconciling items between the Company s basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	The total number of options used to calculate weighted average share equivalents for diluted earnings per share as of December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , was as follows (in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	On June 15, 2009, the Company completed a public offering of 4.6 million shares of its Class A common stock at $24.50 per share.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	The following total number of Class A common stock issuable under the assumed exercises of stock options computed based on the treasury stock method were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share, as the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of its United States subsidiaries.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	Each of the Company s foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of their respective countries.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P72_S2	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to the Company s employees through the Company s Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective terms as directors.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P78_S1	The assumption for the life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P78_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value:
1012620_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries were prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P84_S1	Currency translation adjustments are reflected within the equity section of the balance sheet and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P84_S2	Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations upon substantial or complete liquidation of the underlying investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	Risks and Uncertainties The global economy, which experienced a significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009 that included widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, began to improve in 2010.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	While some economic indicators trended positively, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2011 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to the Company.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact the Company s customers, suppliers and business in general.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	CHANGES IN OPERATIONS: United States On September 1, 2011, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of Arizona Eastern Railway Company (AZER).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	The Company paid the seller $89.5 million in cash at closing, which included a reduction to the purchase price of $0.6 million for the estimated working capital adjustment.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	$0.8 million of purchase price in December 2011, which was paid to the seller in January 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Company incurred $0.6 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2011, which were expensed as incurred.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	The results from AZER s operations have been included in the Company s statement of operations since September 1, 2011, and are included in the Company s North American European Operations segment.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	Headquartered near Miami, Arizona, with 43 employees and 10 locomotives, AZER owns and operates two rail lines totaling approximately 200 track miles in southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico that are connected by 52 miles of trackage rights over the Union Pacific Railroad.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	The largest customer on AZER is Freeport-McMoRan Copper Gold Inc. (Freeport-McMoRan).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	AZER provides rail service to Freeport-McMoRan s largest North American copper mine and its North American smelter, hauling copper concentrate, copper anode, copper rod and sulfuric acid.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P90_S3	In conjunction with the transaction, AZER and Freeport-McMoRan have entered into a long-term operating agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	On December 1, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities (together, FreightLink) for A $331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) (FreightLink Acquisition).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P91_S1	The Company has included the results from GWA (North) Pty Ltd (GWA North), the Company s subsidiary that acquired certain assets of FreightLink, in its statement of operations since December 1, 2010.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P91_S2	Pursuant to the Business Sale Agreement, the Company acquired FreightLink s freight rail business between Tarcoola, South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, certain material contracts, equipment and property leases, as well as FreightLink s plant, equipment and business inventory and the assumption of debt with a carrying value of A $1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represents the fair value of an A $50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P91_S3	As a result of the acquisition, GWA North is now the concessionaire and operator of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P91_S4	The rail line is located on land leased to GWA North by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation (a statutory corporation established by legislation in the Northern Territory) under a concession agreement that expires in 2054 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	GWA North is both a provider of rail haulage to customers on its railroad (above rail services), as well as a track access provider, charging access fees to any rail operators that run on its track (below rail services).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The track access rights are regulated under a statutory access regime established by legislation in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company s subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), has historically operated FreightLink s rail haulage services and provided its crews, managed its train operations and also leased locomotives and wagons to FreightLink.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	As a result of the acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2011 , $33.9 million of GWA non-freight revenues generated from services that have historically been provided to FreightLink were eliminated in consolidation, but this elimination did not have any effect on operating income of the Company.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company incurred $28.2 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2010, which were recorded in earnings as follows: $16.4 million within stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax), $11.0 million within other expenses and $0.8 million within labor and benefits.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company financed the purchase of FreightLink s assets through a combination of cash on hand and borrowing $100.0 million and A $97.0 million (or $94.0 million at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) under the United States and Australian revolving loans, respectively, of the Company's credit agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	For a description of the material terms and conditions under the credit agreement, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	In June 2009, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY), intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P96_S1	Consequently, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded charges of $5.4 million after-tax associated with HCRY.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P96_S2	These charges reflected a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and restructuring charges of $2.3 million and were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	In September 2010, the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario agreed to provide C $30 million (or $29 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) to fund infrastructure improvements that, combined with certain customer agreements, will enable HCRY to continue operations on a long-term basis.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	In addition, HCRY committed to fund approximately C $3 million (or $3 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) of infrastructure improvements.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P97_S2	As a result, the Company reversed $2.3 million ( $1.5 million after-tax) of accrued restructuring charges related to HCRY in September 2010, as HCRY no longer intends to cease its operations.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P97_S3	Because of the substance of the temporary agreement HCRY was operating under from August 15, 2009, through December 31, 2010, HCRY s net operating earnings were included within non-freight revenues as other operating income.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	On January 1, 2011, HCRY began operating under a new agreement with certain customers.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	Because of the substance of the new arrangement, on January 1, 2011, the Company resumed reporting HCRY s operating revenues, including freight revenues and corresponding carloads, and operating expenses within each respective line item of the statement of operations.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	South America On September 29, 2009, in conjunction with its partner UniRail LLC, the Company sold substantially all of its interests in Ferroviaria Oriental S.A., which is located in Eastern Bolivia.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	The Company recorded a net gain on the sale of its investment in Bolivia of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P99_S2	The Company s portion of the sale proceeds totaled $3.9 million , against which it applied the remaining net book value of $3.4 million and direct costs of the sale of $0.1 million .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P99_S3	The Company accounted for the AZER and FreightLink acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P99_S4	Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of AZER and FreightLink have been recorded at their respective acquisition-date fair values and have been consolidated with those of the Company as of their respective acquisition dates.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the FreightLink balance sheet to United States dollars was $0.96 for one Australian dollar (which was the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	The acquisition-date fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of AZER and FreightLink were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	In August 2009, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab, S.A. de C.V. (FCCM) to Viablis, S.A. de C.V. (Viablis) for a net sale price of $2.2 million , including a deposit of $0.5 million received in November 2008.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	Accordingly, the Company recorded a net gain of $2.2 million on the sale within discontinued operations.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	Management determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience within each of the Company s regions.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P107_S3	Management reviews material past due balances on a monthly basis.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P107_S4	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P109_S2	Customers and counterparties that owe the Company money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	For interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	When the Company is the invoicing railroad, therefore, it is exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and the Company is required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if the Company is not paid by the customer.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	Although the Company has procedures for reviewing its receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	Some of the Company s risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are not publicly available or otherwise accessible by the Company and this information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P139_S7	The Company s instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line as the hedged item.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	The portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P142_S1	At hedge inception and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P142_S2	When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the periods it no longer qualifies as a hedge.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P143_S1	For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P143_S2	The Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	The gains or losses from the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(expense).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P145_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P145_S2	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P145_S3	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	On October 2, 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rates on a portion of its outstanding borrowings.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P147_S1	The swap has a notional amount of $120.0 million and requires the Company to pay a fixed rate of 3.88% on the notional amount.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P147_S2	In return, the Company receives one-month LIBOR on the notional amount of the swap, which is equivalent to the Company s variable rate obligation on the notional amounts under its credit agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P147_S3	This swap expires on September 30, 2013.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	The Company s effectiveness testing during the year ended December 31, 2011 , resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	See Note 16, Comprehensive Income, for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedge.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , $181.8 million of third-party debt related to the Company s foreign operations was denominated in the currencies in which its subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of the Company s debt service payments is limited.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P150_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid from the Company's foreign operations, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P150_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from the Company s United States operations to its foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business to the extent such acquisition is funded with United States dollars.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P150_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(expense), net.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	On December 1, 2010, the Company completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A $331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	The Company financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under its credit agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	A portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to Australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of A $105.0 million (or $100.6 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S3	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan, the Company entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A $105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S4	The Swap requires the Company to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.125% based on a notional amount of A $105.0 million and allows the Company to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.48% based on a notional amount of $100.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S5	BBSW is the wholesale interbank reference rate within Australia, which the Company believes is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S6	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, the Company realized a net expense of $5.9 million within interest (expense)/income related to the quarterly settlements of the Swap for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S7	In addition, the Company recognized a net gain of $0.2 million within other income/(expense) related to the mark-to-market of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S8	The fair value of the cross-currency swap represented a current liability of $7.2 million as of December 31, 2011 .
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S9	The fair value of the Swap was estimated based on Level 2 valuation inputs.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P154_S10	The Swap expires on December 1, 2012.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P155_S0	On November 24, 2010, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, with funds to be delivered on December 1, 2010, to secure an exchange rate for A $45 million of the A $331.9 million purchase of the FreightLink assets.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P155_S1	The subsequent decrease in the value of Australian dollar versus the United States dollar between November 24, 2010 and December 1, 2010 and its impact on the A $45 million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of $0.7 million within other (expense)/income, net.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P162_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company s derivative financial instruments consisted of an interest rate swap agreement and a cross-currency swap agreement.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P162_S2	The Company estimates the fair value of its interest rate swap agreement based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.

1012620_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	Long-term debt: Since the Company s long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available to it for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_12_ITEM15_P163_S1	The following table presents the Company s financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, we operate a longer-haul railroad that runs approximately 1,400 miles between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we operated in 39 states in the United States, four Australian states, one Australian territory and four Canadian provinces and provide rail service at 35 ports in North America, Australia and Europe.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , we operated over approximately 14,700 miles of owned, jointly owned or leased track (inclusive of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line operated under a concession agreement) and 3,270 additional miles under other contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	On October 1, 2012, we acquired RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion plus net debt of $659.2 million ), which is our largest acquisition to date.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	RailAmerica owned and operated 45 short line freight railroads in North America, with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces as of the acquisition date.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our acquisition of RailAmerica combined the two largest short line railroad operators in North America.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S3	The acquisition is expected to provide a wide national footprint for future industrial and commercial development along our 108 railroads in North America, and to allow us to realize significant cost savings.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S4	Following our acquisition of RailAmerica, we believe we are the largest operator of short line and regional freight railroads in North America.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S5	GROWTH STRATEGY Since our initial public offering in 1996 through December 31, 2012 , our revenues increased at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3% , from $77.8 million in 1996 to $874.9 million in 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S6	We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P1_S7	The two main drivers of our growth strategy are the execution of (1) our operating strategy and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our railroads operate under strong local management teams, with centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of January 1, 2013, our continuing operations were organized as 11 regions, which include one new region that we created following the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	In the United States, we have eight regions: Rail Link (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Pacific, Mountain West, Central, Southern, Midwest, Ohio Valley and Northeast.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	Outside the United States, we have three regions: Australia, Canada (which includes a contiguous railroad located in the United States) and Europe (which consists of operations in the Netherlands and Belgium).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge and customer service that we view as necessary to achieve our financial goals.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our regional managers continually focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P2_S6	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following four principal elements:
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	In 2012 , G W achieved a consolidated Federal Railroad Association (FRA) reportable injury frequency rate of 0.48 per 200,000 man-hours worked, which does not include RailAmerica's 2012 safety results.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 75% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S4	In 2012, RailAmerica achieved a consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate of 1.75 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S5	On a pro forma basis, G W's reportable injury frequency rate combined with RailAmerica was 0.88 for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S6	For comparative purposes, in January through November 2012, the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average was 3.1 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 3.1 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P3_S7	Based on these results, in 2012, G W was more than six times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages, and also safer than any U.S. Class I railroad.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We generally build and operate each of our regions on a base of large industrial customers and seek to grow rail traffic through marketing efforts.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, we expect our expanded North American footprint will provide us with greater visibility to new commercial and industrial development opportunities in North America and increase the success of our marketing efforts.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	We also pursue additional sources of revenue by marketing to new industrial customers and providing ancillary rail services.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	These ancillary rail services include railcar switching, repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enable shippers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	Separately, in Australia and Europe, where there are open access regimes, we are able to compete for new business opportunities with customers anywhere on the open access rail network.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	We focus on lowering operating costs and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated before our acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead, consolidating equipment and track maintenance contracts, reducing transportation costs and selling surplus assets.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	At the same time, we seek to maximize our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for traffic type and density.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, because of the importance of certain customers and railroads to the regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S5	To assist our local management teams, we provide commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from centralized expertise.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S6	Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I relationship management.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S7	Our operations department assists with the implementation of our safety culture and training programs, manages a centralized purchasing staff to leverage our scale in purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, assists with efficient equipment utilization and service design, and provides mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S8	In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S9	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S10	Since 1985, we have completed 37 acquisitions and made several significant rail equipment investments to serve customers that are developing natural resource projects, such as iron ore mines.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P6_S11	Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:
1012620_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Acquisitions of other regional railroads or short line railroads in the United States and Canada, such as our acquisitions of RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company (AZER) in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Acquisitions of international railroads, such as our acquisitions of FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia and Rotterdam Rail Feeding (RRF) in the Netherlands.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Acquisitions of rail lines of industrial companies, such as our acquisition of railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	When we make acquisitions, we seek to derive revenues and cost synergies wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead functions, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans and equipment utilization and enhanced customer service.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	For instance, with the acquisition of RailAmerica we have identified duplicative corporate overhead costs and general administrative expenses, which we believe are not necessary for the combined operations, and that we anticipate will result in ongoing annual cost savings of approximately $36 million, excluding implementation costs we expect to incur to realize these savings.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	In addition, we intend to leverage RailAmerica's real estate department and plan to implement best practices that are identified as part of the integration across all our railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	Following the RailAmerica acquisition, we are continuing to target these five sources of acquisition and investment opportunities.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S5	We also believe that our larger footprint of railroads in North America will increase the number of future opportunities to make contiguous short line acquisitions due to a higher number of touch points with other railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S6	On a global basis, we believe that our increased scale and greater financial resources will improve our ability to invest in rail opportunities worldwide.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P9_S7	We have played a significant role in the consolidation of the short line industry in North America and have made a number of important railroad investments in international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	According to the AAR, there are 567 railroads in the United States operating over 138,500 miles of track.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The STB classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on the amount of an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Under current classification levels, Class I railroads are individual railroads (not including holding companies) with over $433.2 million in revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Regional and Local railroads operate approximately 43,000 miles of track in the United States.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	The primary function of these smaller railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I networks.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	The following table shows the breakdown of railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	(1) CSX Corp, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern Corp., Kansas City Southern Railway Company, Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Source: AAR 2012 Railroad Facts Book Class I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density intercity traffic lanes.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Typically, short line (or local) railroads serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Short line railroads have more predictable and straightforward operations as they generally perform point-to-point service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the large Class I railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Regional and short line railroad traffic is largely driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	Divestiture of branch lines enabled Class I carriers to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment, and spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We operate one regional and 100 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 9,500 miles of track.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	According to Rail Trends 2012 , published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are 27,652 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	We operate seven local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,200 miles of track.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Australia Australia has over 25,000 miles (approximately 40,000 kilometers) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers together, as well as key mining regions to ports.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, standard and narrow gauge.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Adelaide, South Australia to Darwin, Northern Territory).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,900 miles (approximately 4,700 kilometers) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles (approximately 2,200 kilometers) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Australian rail freight industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland Australian states and in the Northern Territory.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	The rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use, and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The rail industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track they own or lease.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Through our concession agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the primary tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Because Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition from other rail carriers, as well as competition from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks for above rail business.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	The open access nature of the Australian rail freight industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take or pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator more difficult.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for a substantial majority of the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,350 miles of track under its control on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	According to the trade association, Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are currently 17 rail operators that provide freight rail services in the Netherlands.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	In the Netherlands, we operate primarily in the Port of Rotterdam pursuant to the open access regime.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,225 miles of track under its control on the Belgian rail network and 13 rail operators certified for freight transport in Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	In Belgium, we operate primarily in the Port of Antwerp pursuant to the open access regime.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2012 , through our subsidiaries, we owned or leased 111 freight railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	Of these, 109 are short line railroads and one is a regional freight railroad with a total of approximately 13,300 miles of track in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P34_S3	We also operated one longer-haul 1,400 -mile railroad, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia, pursuant to a concession agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P34_S4	Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over 3,270 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Freight Revenues We generate freight revenues primarily from the haulage of freight by rail.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Freight revenues represented 71.4% , 70.3% and 62.2% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	Non-Freight Revenues We generate non-freight revenues primarily from the following activities:
1012620_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Railroad construction revenues earned by Atlas Railroad Construction (Atlas) for railroad engineering, construction, maintenance and repair, primarily in the midwestern, northeastern and southeastern United States, for short line and regional railroads, public-transit agencies and industrial customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	Non-freight revenues represented 28.6% , 29.7% and 37.8% of our total operating revenues in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	Railcar switching represented 54.0% , 52.1% and 46.5% of our total non-freight revenues in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Customers As of December 31, 2012 , our operations served over 2,000 freight customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Freight revenues from our 10 largest freight customers (not including RailAmerica customers) accounted for approximately 25% , 24% and 22% of our operating revenues in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	Six of our 10 largest freight customers (not including RailAmerica customers) in 2012 were located in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	Freight revenues from RailAmerica's 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 13% of their operating revenues in 2012 and their largest freight customer was a company in the steel and metals industry and represented approximately 2.8% of their total revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms ranging from less than one year to 20 years.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	These contracts generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion linked to our invested capital and the variable portion based on the volumes shipped.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 , see the discussion under Part II Item 7.

1012620_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Haulage traffic is shipped by other rail carriers, but moves over our rail lines for a fee pursuant to contractual arrangements with those carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our geographic areas, see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV Item 15.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Traffic Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized as interline, local or overhead traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	Interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	Overhead traffic passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the carload originating or terminating on the line.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S4	Unlike overhead traffic, interline and local traffic in North America provide us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S5	However, the open access regime in Australia permits other participants in the above rail industry to compete for our existing traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P45_S6	In 2012 , revenues generated from interline and local traffic constituted approximately 98% of our freight revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Seasonality of Operations Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or the demand cycle for the commodity.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	For instance, certain agricultural and food products, like winter wheat in Canada, ship only during certain months each year.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations as a result of weather patterns.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	In addition, due to adverse winter weather conditions, we also tend to incur higher operating costs during the first and fourth quarters.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season ( e.g., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , our railroads and industrial switching locations had approximately 4,600 full time employees.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P47_S6	Of this total, approximately 1,750 employees were union members.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our railroads have 77 contracts with unions.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 17 of those agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 68 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Railway Labor Act (RLA) governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the United States.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	The RLA establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Canada Labour Code and the relevant provincial labor laws govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Canada.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	The Federal Fair Work Act governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	The RLA and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	RRF is not party to any collective bargaining agreements in the Netherlands, but it is party to a collective bargaining agreement in Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We believe we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	and industry sponsored safety programs and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association Safety Committee.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	G W's consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate (excluding the RailAmerica railroads), as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, was 0.48 and 0.53 in 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	RailAmerica's consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate was 1.75 and 1.93 in 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	On a pro forma basis, G W's FRA reportable injury frequency rate combined with RailAmerica was 0.88 for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads in the rail industry was 3.1 in 2012 (through November) and 3.5 in 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	We expect that the extension of G W's safety culture to the RailAmerica railroads will be a significant focus as we integrate the RailAmerica railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	RailAmerica's legacy liability and property insurance coverage will remain in place until our annual insurance renewal later in 2013, following which it is expected that all of our operations will be covered under one insurance program.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	RailAmerica's primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $ 1.0 million per occurrence and prior self-insured retentions have been as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	The liability policies cover sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P57_S5	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	G W's property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $1.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	RailAmerica's primary property damage policies have self-insured retentions that are currently up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	The property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Employees of our United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under our liability policies.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Employees of our industrial switching and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers compensation policies.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S3	Employees of our Canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers compensation policy.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S4	Employees of our Australian operations are covered by the respective state-based workers compensation legislation in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S5	Employees of our European operations are covered by the workers compensation legislation of the Netherlands and Belgium, as applicable.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P59_S6	We believe our insurance coverage is adequate given our experience and the experience of the rail industry within the geographies we operate.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	COMPETITION The unique and difficult to replicate infrastructure associated with railroads is a key benefit of the industry as compared to other modes of transportation, such as trucking (which uses public highways, toll roads, etc.) and shipping (which uses river systems and ports).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	However, railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes, ships, barges and pipelines.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	In North America, a railroad typically is the only rail carrier directly serving a customer on its line, which is a key differentiating factor versus trucking and shipping.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	Most freight is interchanged between other railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	In Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	To a lesser degree, we also face competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments in projects, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P64_S3	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and operator of rail properties, combined with our managerial and financial resources, positions us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P64_S4	In addition to environmental laws, securities laws, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	The FRA, DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction over safety, which includes the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and rail car inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	The STB launched wide-ranging proceedings to explore whether to expand rail regulation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	The STB has not taken further action and denied a petition seeking one form of access regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Several bills were introduced in the United States Senate in early 2011 that would expand the regulatory authority of the STB and could include new antitrust provisions.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	Additionally, a two-year DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits, which commenced in 2012, could result in subsequent federal legislation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, we continue to monitor these proposed bills.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	In 2010, the FRA issued final rules governing the installation of positive train control (PTC) by the end of 2015.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC or PTC-related equipment by the end of 2015.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P72_S2	We do not expect that our compliance with the final rules governing the installation of PTC will give rise to any material financial expenditures.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Canada St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec) and Ottawa Valley Railway are federally regulated railroads that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canada Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	In addition, Huron Central Railway, Goderich-Exeter Railway and Southern Ontario Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	Provincially regulated railways operate only within one province and hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by a provincial authority.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	In the Province of Quebec, the Fitness Certificate is delivered by the Minist re des Transports du Quebec, while in Ontario, under the Shortline Railways Act, 1995, a license must be obtained from the Registrar of Shortline Railways.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated, as are railway services.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada s Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Australia In Australia, regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our Australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	Regulation of track access is governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P77_S3	The state access regimes are required to be certified by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P77_S4	As a result, with respect to rail infrastructure access, our Australian subsidiaries are subject to the state-based access regimes.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P77_S5	In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	At the European level, several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	These directives generally cover the development of railways, allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	The European Union (EU) legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network and EU Member States must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	These directives have been implemented in Dutch railway legislation such as the Railways Act and in Belgian railway legislation such as the Law on Railway Safety.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Rotterdam to the German border and within the Port of Rotterdam).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	All railways in the Netherlands must have a license and a safety certificate issued by the regulator, the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate, part of the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	A rail operator must also have a license from ProRail and/or Keyrail, the Dutch rail infrastructure authorities, to use the rail infrastructure.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	The Dutch Competition Authority is charged with the supervision of compliance with the European Community's directives on the development of the railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations, which is currently hosted by FPS Mobility and Transport, and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	Rail service providers based in Belgium must obtain a rail operator license from the Federal Minister for Mobility and Transport.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	Rail service providers that wish to operate in Belgium must obtain a safety certificate, which is comprised of Parts A and B. Part A must be obtained from the Railway Safety and Interoperability Service (SSICF) if the rail service provider is based in Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P83_S3	Part B must be obtained from SSICF regardless of where the rail service provider is based.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	In Belgium, the Belgium Competition Authority is responsible for promoting and safeguarding active competition in Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	Both the Dutch Competition Authority and the Belgium Competition Authority work together with other competition authorities and are part of the European Competition Network, the European Competition Authorities and the International Competition Network .
1012620_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions, and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	In Australia, these functions are administered primarily by the Department of Transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	In the Netherlands, European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	European, national and local environmental policies are administered within the FPS Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment in Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our Australian operations were subject to three Directions issued by the Department of Natural Resources, Environment, the Arts and Sport of the Northern Territory following the December 27, 2011 derailment of a GWA freight train in flood waters associated with Cyclone Grant.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	The derailment spilled freight, including copper concentrate, into the Edith River (Edith River Derailment).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	The Directions required us to clean up and rectify pollution, namely any and all freight that fell from the train into the Edith River, and to prevent further pollution or future harm.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P88_S3	GWA was informed on February 4, 2013 that it is no longer subject to the Directions.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Separately, the Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our Australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	Consequently, the Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P89_S2	Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	We estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	In August of 2009, we completed the sale of 100% of the share capital of Ferrocarriles Chiapas Mayab, S.A. de C.V. (FCCM), our Mexican operating subsidiary, to Viablis, S.A. de C.V. (Viablis).
1012620_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of our remaining Mexican subsidiary, GW Servicios S.A. (Servicios), which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1_P92_S2	We do not expect any material adverse financial impact from Servicios.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P92_S3	Results of our Mexican operations are included in results from discontinued operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on September 1, 1977.

1012620_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	It is difficult to predict how general global macroeconomics and business conditions will impact our business, our customers, our suppliers and freight rail transportation in general.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	An economic downturn or a recession that affects the countries where we operate or to where the goods we transport are exported, could negatively impact our business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	While the global economy has recovered in recent years from the significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been uneven, and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The recent economic improvements may not be broad-based or sustainable and may not enhance conditions in the markets relevant to us.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	For instance, in Australia, a significant portion of the commodities we transport are supporting economic growth and industrial development in Asian countries, particularly China, and a sustained slowdown in such countries could impact us.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Slower growth in China, and the resulting impact on demand for, and lower prices of, natural resources could be a factor influencing decisions to delay and cancel certain mining projects in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition, we anticipate benefiting from development of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from shale regions in the United States, but continued low natural gas prices could reduce such development and the benefit we could realize.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Further, the United States debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns and the possibility that the United States lawmakers may be unable to effectively reduce budget deficits have increased the possibility of a new economic slowdown or recession in the United States.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Moreover, the eurozone debt crisis could lead to further political and financial turmoil, and to a destabilization of financial markets and the overall financial and euro monetary system.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In addition, we are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from economic activity and industrialization could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our inability to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We may not be able to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Evaluating acquisition targets gives rise to additional costs related to legal, financial, operating and industry due diligence.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	In addition, acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and, to the extent financed with debt, additional interest costs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Integrating acquired businesses, including RailAmerica, could also result in significant unexpected costs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Further, the process of acquiring businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	For example, while we expect the acquisition of RailAmerica to result in approximately $36 million of annual savings and other financial and operational benefits as described in "Part I Item I. Business" of this Annual Report, we may be unable to realize these savings or other benefits in the time frame that we expect or at all.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements, including renewals of leases with Class I railroads, operating costs, competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	There is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that the Company will not discover unanticipated liabilities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Further, while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Also, the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S8	For example, if key employees of RailAmerica depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of RailAmerica could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S9	Finally, the physical conditions of the assets acquired may not materialize.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S10	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S11	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S12	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P4_S13	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past, principally through the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Since January 1, 1996, we have acquired interests in 103 railroads, all of which were purchased for cash, and our growth strategy contemplates additional acquisitions.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , we had $64.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $396.3 million of undrawn revolver capacity available for acquisitions or other activities, subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S8	To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S9	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S11	If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P10_S12	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We lease several railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under long-term lease arrangements, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 8% of our 2012 total revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, certain of the RailAmerica railroads we acquired are also operated pursuant to lease agreements with Class I railroads that will expire and may not be extended, which could give rise to a loss in revenues and a potential write down in the book value of our assets.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Leases from Class I railroads that could expire in each of the next 10 years would represent less than 3% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on the estimated combined revenues of G W and RailAmerica for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	For example, our revenues associated with leases from Class I railroads subject to expiration in each of the next five years would represent approximately 0.2%, 2.7%, 0.2%, 0.0% and 1.7% of our revenues in each of those years, respectively, based on the estimated combined revenues of G W and RailAmerica for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our operations served over 2,000 freight customers in 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Freight revenues from our 10 largest freight customers (not including RailAmerica customers) accounted for approximately 25% of our operating revenues in 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Six of our 10 largest freight customers in 2012 were located in Australia and accounted for approximately 15.6% of our operating revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In 2012 , our largest freight customer was a company in the farm and food products industry and represented approximately 4.4% of our operating revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Freight revenues from RailAmerica's 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 13% of its operating revenues in 2012 and its largest freight customer was a company in the steel and metals industry and represented approximately 2.8% of its total revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Under these contracts, freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In Australia, a number of our customer contracts contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the variable portion based on the volumes shipped.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In 2012 , approximately 87% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements, freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	During 2012 , we obtained government funding for 55 separate projects that were partially or completely funded by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 19% of our total capital expenditures during 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S7	In addition, competition for government funding from other short line railroads, Class I railroads and other companies is significant, and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S8	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations, such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P19_S9	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects, incur additional debt or use additional cash.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our results of operations and rail structure are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the northeastern United States and Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States and Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment or other substantial disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations, it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States, which lessen demand for coal.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our revenues generated by our Australian operations are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the South Australian grain harvest and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the Northern Territory.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by such weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the northern United States and Canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Such weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In the United States, these agencies include the STB, DOT, FRA of the DOT, MSHA, OSHA, EPA, DHS and other federal and state agencies.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In Australia, we are subject to both Commonwealth and state regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In Canada, we are subject to regulation by the CTA, TC and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, the Transport, Public Works and Water Management Inspectorate and the Dutch railways managers, ProRail and Keyrail.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations, which is currently hosted by FPS Mobility and Transport, and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Business Regulation for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	There are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the United States in recent years, including legislation to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, various proceedings have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition, interchange commitments and competitive access .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	A two-year DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits also commenced in 2012, and could result in subsequent federal legislation.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, specific initiatives being considered by Congress and the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Significant legislative or regulatory activity could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our Senior Secured Syndicated Facility Agreement (the New Credit Agreement) contains numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our New Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our New Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and tests.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our failure to comply with the obligations in our New Credit Agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the New Credit Agreement or other debt agreements, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , we had a total indebtedness of $1.9 billion , and we had unused commitments of $396.3 million under our New Credit Agreement (after giving effect to $3.6 million of undrawn letters of credit which reduces such availability).
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Subject to the limits contained in the New Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition, the New Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt and foreclosure on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	For interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	When we are the invoicing railroad, therefore, we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and we are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S5	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular those in the mining and natural resources industry, before the customer commences operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S7	In those cases, we may be exposed to start-up risks that we would not be exposed to in respect of customers with active operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P33_S8	As a result, unexpected credit exposures or start-up delays could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S5	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S6	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Also, commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S8	For example, natural gas can compete with coal we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P35_S9	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S4	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S5	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P36_S6	For information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, see Additional Risks Associated with our Foreign Operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Market and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our operating costs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, as well as its physical impacts, could materially affect us.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	For example, federal, state and local laws, regulations, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives, equipment, vehicles and machinery or our rail yards.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, including the closure of coal-fired power plants we serve, climate change litigation and climate change itself could decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including, for example, coal mining operations, natural gas developers and producers, coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, such as by resulting in the closure of coal-fired power plants that we serve, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change including claims alleging impact of our operations on climate change.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Any such market or regulatory responses or litigation, as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming, such as floods, rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and intense storms, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned or operated by us.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Under some environmental statutes, such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several, whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs, including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of cost or risk.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	For instance, existing legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S8	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S9	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P39_S11	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We have insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading, accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other incidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub-limits.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, on certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are commingled with passenger trains.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	For instance, in Oregon, our Portland Western Railroad operates certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon and our New England Central Railroad is also used by Amtrak for passenger service in New England.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Further, we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Derailments, collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property casualties and subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us, including such things as derailments, accidents, discharge of toxic or hazardous materials, or other like occurrences in the industry, may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims' expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to operations which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	For instance, we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the floating interest rate payments under our New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	While these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In 2012 , G W and RailAmerica consumed 25.2 million gallons and 15.5 million gallons of diesel fuel, respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	However, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease and could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 13% and 14% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P45_S6	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S4	We are a party to 77 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 17 of those agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Approximately 1,750 of our approximately 4,600 full time employees are union members.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P47_S7	We have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional 68 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If such Class I railroads were to have a work stoppage or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S5	To date, we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S7	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, or attract and retain senior leadership, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S8	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S9	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S10	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S11	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 15% of our current workforce, including employees we obtained from the recent RailAmerica acquisition, will become eligible for retirement.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S12	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S13	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S14	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S15	In addition, if key employees of RailAmerica depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of RailAmerica could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S16	Finally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S17	The loss of any key personnel could require the remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S18	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership, and the inability to find a suitable replacement, could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S19	Our ability to manage all of these risks is further complicated by the geographic diversity of our operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P48_S20	If any of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our profit margins could decrease and our growth strategy could be impaired.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain rail cars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as rail cars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	If the number of available rail cars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these rail cars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain rail cars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As of January 1, 2013 , according to the AAR, approximately 21% of the North American railcar fleet was in storage.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In some cases we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	For example, in Australia the availability of new locomotives is limited, with long lead times for delivery.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe accounted for 33% , 9% , and 2% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the acquisition of RailAmerica, our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe accounted for 19% , 8% and 1% of our long-lived assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be cancelled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If our concession or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider, but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P58_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Further, the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The Netherlands and Belgium also have open access regimes that permit third-party rail operators to compete for the business of RRF, our subsidiary in the Netherlands.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in Australia is a requirement under our concession deeds and some customer contracts.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Following significant derailments, the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operational performance and financial results.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Changes to the mining tax regime in Australia could have a negative impact on our existing customers and the prospects for new customer initiatives underway.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The Australian Government approved a new Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) that was effective as of July 1, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The MRRT is a tax on profits generated from the exploitation of certain non-renewable resources in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The implementation of the MRRT could result in an increase in operating costs for mining assets based in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S3	The tax could also have an adverse effect on our Australian operations by reducing the volume of commodities mined in Australia for us to transport, as well as by reducing levels of demand for Australian commodities and our transportation of those commodities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Consequently, the introduction of the MRRT could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Our ability to use RailAmerica's Section 45G tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation due to a change in the ownership of its stock.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P66_S6	As of December 31, 2012 , RailAmerica had tax benefits totaling approximately $135.9 million of Section 45G tax credit carryforwards and federal net operating loss carryforwards.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited and may result in a partial or full write down of the related deferred tax assets.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	An ownership change is defined generally for these purposes as a greater than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period, taking into account shareholders that own 5% or more by value of our common stock.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	While we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax attributes, our acquisition of RailAmerica may limit our ability to use RailAmerica's net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future tax liabilities.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit expires on December 31, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate in 2014 will be higher if the credit is not extended.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P70_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of their tax year.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P70_S3	On January 2, 2013, the Short Line Tax Credit (which had previously expired on December 31, 2011) was extended for 2012 and 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P70_S4	The most recent extension of the Short Line Tax Credit only extended the credit through December 31, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P70_S5	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, the loss of the credit will increase our effective tax rate and reduce our reported earnings per share.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If the earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries were required to be distributed, our effective tax rate could be higher.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of their respective countries.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P71_S3	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P71_S4	The amount of those earnings was $251.4 million as of December 31, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Although it is our current intention to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of our controlled foreign subsidiaries, if the earnings were required to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, and could result in a higher effective tax rate for us, thereby reducing our earnings.

1012620_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of the shares of Class A common stock.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	It is possible that we are a United States real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	If we are or become a United States real property holding corporation, so long as Class A common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder (i.e., a holder that is not a United States citizen or resident, a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and certain trusts and estates) who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more than 5% of Class A common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of Class A common stock.
1012620_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 14,700 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire and may not be extended in the next few years.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Leases from Class I railroads that could expire in each of the next 10 years would represent less than 3% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on the estimated combined revenues of G W and RailAmerica for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	For additional information on these lease expirations see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also operate, through various trackage and operating rights agreements, over 3,270 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	The track miles listed below exclude 1,774 miles of sidings and yards located in the United States ( 1,544 miles), Canada ( 159 miles) and Australia ( 71 miles), as well as track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	In addition, during 2013 we expect to record mortgages on many of the owned properties described in the table below as additional security for our outstanding obligations under our New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2012 , with respect to our railroads:
1012620_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	(1) The GNWR and DMM are now operated by RSR (2) ALY merged with BPRR in January 2004 (3) BR merged with BPRR in January 2004 (4) PS merged with BPRR in January 2004 EQUIPMENT As of December 31, 2012 , our rolling stock, including the rolling stock we obtained as a result of the recent RailAmerica acquisition, consisted of 1,055 locomotives, of which 873 were owned and 182 were leased, and 22,336 rail cars, of which 4,025 were owned and 18,311 were leased.
1012620_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	A breakdown of the types of rail cars owned and leased by our continuing operations is set forth in the table below:
1012620_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The two lawsuits filed in the Florida Circuit Court alleged, among other things, that the RailAmerica directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their decision to sell RailAmerica to Genesee Wyoming via an allegedly flawed process and failed to obtain the best financial and other terms and that RailAmerica and Genesee Wyoming aided and abetted those alleged breaches of duty.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaints requested, among other relief, an order to enjoin consummation of the merger and attorneys' fees.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	On July 31, 2012, plaintiffs in the Florida actions filed a motion to consolidate the two Florida actions, appoint plaintiffs Langan and Sambuco as lead plaintiffs and appoint lead counsel in the proposed consolidated action.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	Plaintiffs in the Florida actions also filed an emergency motion for expedited proceedings on August 7, 2012 and an amended complaint on August 8, 2012, which included allegations that the information statement filed by RailAmerica on August 3, 2012, omitted material information about the proposed merger.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	On August 17, 2012, the parties in the Florida actions submitted a stipulation for expedited proceedings, which the Florida Circuit Court ordered on August 20, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	The three lawsuits filed in Delaware Court named the same defendants, alleged substantially similar claims, and sought similar relief as the Florida actions.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	The parties to the Delaware actions submitted orders of dismissal in November 2012, which the Delaware Court has granted.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	On December 7, 2012, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, we and the other parties to the Florida actions executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release to settle all related claims.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	The settlement is not material and is subject to, among other things, final approval by the Florida Circuit Court.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P2_S4	On January 28, 2013, the Florida Circuit Court gave preliminary approval of the settlement and scheduled a hearing on final approval of the settlement for May 15, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	In addition to the lawsuits set forth above, from time to time, we are a defendant in certain lawsuits resulting from our operations in the ordinary course.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits.
1012620_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	Based upon currently available information, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

1012620_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	Dividends We did not pay cash dividends to our common stockholders in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future and intend to retain earnings, if any, for future operation and expansion of our business.
1012620_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	Any determination to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and, subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in our credit agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM5_P4_S3	In accordance with the Carlyle Group Investment Agreement, we paid $4.4 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock dividends in 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM5_P4_S4	On February 13, 2013, we converted the $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with a 5% coupon, issued to The Carlyle Group, into 5,984,232 shares of G W Class A common stock.

1012620_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) On October 1, 2012, we acquired 100% of RailAmerica for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion , or $27.50 per share, plus the payoff of RailAmerica's debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P2_S2	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(3) On December 1, 2010, we acquired $320.0 million of net assets from FreightLink.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	In 2010, we incurred $28.2 million of acquisition-related expenses charged to earnings related to this transaction.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P3_S2	In addition, we reversed $2.3 million of accrued restructuring expense related to our Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY).
1012620_13_ITEM6_P3_S3	(4) In 2009, we acquired the 12.6% interest in Maryland Midland Railway, Inc. that we did not already own for $4.4 million.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P3_S4	In addition, with respect to HCRY, we recorded a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and $2.3 million of restructuring expense, which were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million.
1012620_13_ITEM6_P3_S5	(5) In 2008, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Summit View, Inc., the parent company of 10 short line railroads known as the Ohio Central Railway System (OCR), with net assets of $227.8 million; CAGY Industries, Inc., the parent company of three short line railroads, with net assets of $107.2 million; Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V. in the Netherlands with net assets of $23.6 million; and Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Inc. with net assets of $17.1 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Outlook for 2013 Safety Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We have led the railroad industry in safety for the past four years and our goal for 2013 is continuous improvement in safety and a consolidated injury frequency ratio of 0.45 reportable injuries per 200,000 man hours.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	We have a significant challenge and opportunity as we integrate the RailAmerica railroads and implement our safety culture, with the ultimate goal of having zero injuries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financial Expectations North America and Europe - We expect that the most significant impact on our financial results in 2013 will be the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Primarily as a result of the acquisition, we anticipate revenues from our North America and Europe reporting segment to increase significantly in 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	In addition to the impact of the RailAmerica acquisition, we expect growth in our same railroad freight revenues due to increases in traffic across most of our commodity groups.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	In particular, we anticipate growth in petroleum products traffic due to new crude oil and natural gas liquids customers.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	We expect coal traffic to remain stable and agricultural products traffic to decrease due to the impact of drought on the 2012 United States grain harvest.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Australia - We expect revenue and operating income growth from the continued ramp up of our new standard gauge iron ore service that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	We also anticipate the delivery of new narrow gauge locomotives in the first quarter of 2013 and the expansion of our narrow gauge iron ore service in the second quarter of 2013, which is expected to improve our Australian financial results.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	We expect our intermodal revenues to increase in 2013 as a result of a reduction in slow orders on the track, increased operational efficiency and new business, as well as the non-recurrence of the disruptions caused by the Edith River Bridge incident in late December 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	We expect to make capital investments totaling approximately $255 million in 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	Of this total, $145 million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital, $20 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in eight of our North American operating regions (all except for Mountain West) and $17 million is planned for specific 2013 projects, including certain track upgrades and locomotive lease buyouts.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	In addition, we expect to spend $73 million on business development related capital, primarily new locomotives for our operations in Australia, the construction of a new rail spur in Canada and track improvements in the United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	An extension of the Short Line Tax Credit for the 2012 and 2013 tax years was passed in January 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result, our 2013 financial results will include the tax credits for both the 2012 and 2013 tax years.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	We expect the extension of the Short Line Tax Credit to produce book income tax benefits of approximately $35 million and $25 million , respectively, for fiscal years 2012 and 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Because the extension became law in 2013, the 2012 impact will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	In addition to the integration of the RailAmerica acquisition, we will continue to work on a number of potential projects located across the geographic markets in which we currently operate.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	For example, in Australia and Canada, we will continue to work on additional bulk minerals export projects.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	In the United States, opportunities to acquire additional short line railroads are numerous.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	In addition, we expect with the expanded rail footprint provided by the RailAmerica acquisition, we will increase our industrial development focus with the goal of adding new customers and/or facilities to our railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Specific areas of focus will be on shale oil and gas related projects as well as on additional energy and industrial projects related to coal, wood pellets and biomass.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	In addition, we may explore acquisitions in countries or markets in which we do not operate currently.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	In addition, we operate the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	Our operations currently include 111 railroads organized into 11 regions, with approximately 14,700 miles of owned and leased track and 3,270 additional miles under track access arrangements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P5_S7	In addition, we provide rail service at 35 ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	On October 1, 2012, we completed the acquisition of RailAmerica for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of $1.4 billion plus net debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	For additional information regarding RailAmerica, see " Changes in Operations" and " RailAmerica Equity Method Investment" below.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	RailAmerica, owned and operated 45 short line freight railroads in North America with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces as of the acquisition date.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Net income in the year ended December 31, 2012 was $52.4 million , compared with net income of $119.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table below of $77.3 million that primarily relate to the RailAmerica acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2012 and significant items listed in the table below of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , net income in the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been $129.7 million , compared with net income of $105.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	Our diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders in the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.02 with 51.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to our common stockholders of $2.79 with 42.8 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table below of $1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $0.33 for the year ended December 31, 2011 , diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been $2.53 with 51.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS of $2.47 with 42.8 million weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our results in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included certain significant items that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Operating revenues increased $45.8 million , or 5.5% , to $874.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $829.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase in our operating revenues included $22.7 million in net revenues from new operations and a $23.1 million , or 2.8% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	When we discuss either revenues from existing operations or same railroad revenues, we are referring to the change in our revenues, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	Operating income in the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $1.5 million , or 0.8% , to $190.3 million , compared with $191.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table above of $20.9 million and $2.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, operating income in the year ended December 31, 2012 would have been $211.2 million , compared with operating income of $189.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	Our operating ratio was 78.2% in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with an operating ratio of 76.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S6	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table above, our operating ratio would have been 75.9% in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with an operating ratio of 77.1% in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we generated $170.8 million in cash from operating activities from continuing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S8	During the same period, we purchased $231.7 million of property and equipment, including $101.9 million for the investment in new Australian equipment, and we paid $1.9 billion in net cash for acquisitions.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P9_S9	These payments were partially offset by $39.6 million in cash received largely from government grants as well as other outside parties for capital spending and $15.3 million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Changes in Operations United States RailAmerica, Inc.: On October 1, 2012 , we acquired 100% of RailAmerica, Inc.'s (RailAmerica) outstanding shares for cash at a price of $27.50 per share and in connection with such acquisition, we repaid RailAmerica's term loan and revolving credit facility.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	The calculation of the total consideration for the RailAmerica acquisition is presented below (in thousands, except per share amount):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	We financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's common stock, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of G W's and RailAmerica's outstanding debt prior to the acquisition, as well as transaction and financing related expenses with approximately $1.9 billion of debt from our new five-year Senior Secured Syndicated Facility Agreement (the New Credit Agreement) (See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), $475.5 million of gross proceeds from the public offerings of our Class A common stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) (See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and $350.0 million through a private issuance of mandatorily convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle) (see Notes 4 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and is included in our North American and European Operations segment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), a new accounting basis was established for RailAmerica on October 1, 2012 for its stand-alone financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Condensed consolidated financial information for RailAmerica as of and for the period ended December 28, 2012 is included in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , as discussed more fully under Contingent Forward Sale Contract in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition (the Investment Agreement).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The expense resulted from the significant increase in G W's share price between July 23, 2012 (the date we entered into the Investment Agreement) and September 28, 2012 (the last trading date prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	We also incurred $18.6 million of acquisition-related costs and $11.5 million of integration costs related to this transaction during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	We recognized $15.6 million of net income from our equity investment in RailAmerica during the three months ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	The income from equity investment included $3.5 million of after-tax acquisition/integration costs incurred by RailAmerica in the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	With the acquisition of RailAmerica, we have identified duplicative corporate overhead costs and general administrative expenses, which we believe are not necessary for the combined operations, and that we anticipate will result in ongoing annual cost savings of approximately $36 million, excluding implementation costs we expect to incur to realize these savings.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	In April 2012, our newly formed subsidiary, the Columbus Chattahoochee Railroad, Inc. (CCH), signed an agreement with Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NS) to lease and operate a 26 -mile segment of NS track that runs from Girard, Alabama to Mahrt, Alabama.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Operations commenced on July 1, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The CCH interchanges with NS in Columbus, Georgia where our Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Inc. also has operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	The results from CCH s operations have been included in our statement of operations effective July 1, 2012 and are included in our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	In November 2011, our newly formed subsidiary, the Hilton Albany Railroad, Inc. (HAL), signed an agreement with NS to lease and operate a 56 -mile segment of NS track that runs from Hilton, Georgia to Albany, Georgia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Operations commenced on January 1, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The HAL handles primarily overhead traffic between NS and our following railroads: The Bay Line Railroad, L.L.C.; Chattahoochee Bay Railroad, Inc.; Chattahoochee Industrial Railroad; and Georgia Southwestern Railroad, Inc.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	In addition, the HAL serves several local agricultural and aggregate customers in southwest Georgia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	The results from HAL s operations have been included in our statement of operations since January 1, 2012 and are included in our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Arizona Eastern Railway Company: On September 1, 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of AZER.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	We paid the seller $89.5 million in cash at closing, which included a reduction in purchase price of $0.6 million based on the estimated working capital adjustment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Following the final working capital adjustment, we recorded an additional $0.8 million of purchase price in December 2011, which was paid to the seller in January 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	We incurred $0.6 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2012 , which were expensed as incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P18_S4	The results from AZER s operations have been included in our statement of operations since September 1, 2011 and are included in our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Headquartered near Miami, Arizona, with 43 employees and 10 locomotives, AZER owned and operated two rail lines totaling approximately 200 track miles in southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico connected by 52 miles of trackage rights over the Union Pacific Railroad as of the acquisition date.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The largest customer on AZER is Freeport-McMoRan Copper Gold Inc. (Freeport-McMoRan).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	AZER provides rail service to Freeport-McMoRan s largest North American copper mine and its North American smelter, hauling copper concentrate, copper anode, copper rod and sulfuric acid.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	In conjunction with the transaction, AZER and Freeport-McMoRan have entered into a long-term operating agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	In July 2012, GWA announced that it had expanded two existing rail haulage contracts with Arrium Limited (formerly OneSteel) to transport an additional 2.7 million tons per year of export iron ore in South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	To support the increased shipments under the two contracts, GWA invested A$52.1 million (or $54.1 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) in 2012 to purchase narrow gauge locomotives and wagons, as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	GWA expects to invest an additional A$17.9 million (or $18.7 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) in 2013 to support the increased shipments.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Alice Springs and Cook: In May 2012, our subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), entered into an agreement with Asciano Services Pty Ltd (AIO), a subsidiary of Asciano Pty Ltd, whereby GWA agreed to purchase an intermodal and freight terminal in Alice Springs, Northern Territory from AIO and we agreed to sell AIO certain assets in the township of Cook, South Australia that included our third-party fuel-sales business.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	We completed the purchase of the Alice Springs intermodal and freight terminal in June 2012 for A$9.0 million (or $9.2 million at the exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) plus A$0.5 million (or $0.6 million at the exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) tax liability for stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Previously, GWA had leased the facility from AIO.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	The sale of the assets in Cook closed in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	We received A$4.0 million (or $4.1 million at the exchange rate on September 30, 2012) in pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale and recognized an after-tax book gain of A$1.3 million (or $1.3 million at the exchange rate on September 30, 2012), or approximately $0.03 per share.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	On December 1, 2010, through our subsidiary, GWA (North) Pty Ltd (GWA North), we completed the acquisition of the assets of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities (together, FreightLink) for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) (FreightLink Acquisition).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The results of operations for GWA North have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Pursuant to the Business Sale Agreement, we acquired FreightLink s freight rail business between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, certain material contracts, equipment and property leases, as well as FreightLink s plant, equipment and business inventory.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	In addition, as part of the acquisition, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A$50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	As a result of the acquisition, GWA North is now the concessionaire and operator of the approximately 1,400-mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The rail line is located on land leased to GWA North by the AustralAsia Railway Corporation (a statutory corporation established by legislation in the Northern Territory) under a concession agreement that expires in 2054 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	GWA North is both a provider of rail haulage to customers on its railroad (above rail services), as well as a track access provider, charging access fees to any rail operators that run on its track (below rail services).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The track access rights are regulated under a statutory access regime established by legislation in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our subsidiary, GWA, historically operated FreightLink s rail haulage services, provided its crews, managed its train operations and leased locomotives and wagons to FreightLink.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Prior to the completion of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line in 2004, potential mining projects located in the Northern Territory had no economically viable transportation link to an export port.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Since the completion of the rail line, there has been an increase in mineral exploration and development in the Northern Territory and South Australia along the rail corridor.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	We believe the FreightLink Acquisition provides us significant organic growth opportunities as it positions us to capitalize on future mineral development in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	We incurred $28.2 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction in 2010, which were recorded in earnings as follows: $16.4 million within stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax), $11.0 million within other expenses and $0.8 million within labor and benefits.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	We financed the purchase of FreightLink s assets through a combination of cash on hand and borrowing of $100.0 million and A$97.0 million (or $94.0 million at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) under the United States and Australian revolving loans, respectively, of our credit agreement then in effect.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Canada Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd.:
1012620_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	On August 2, 2012, we announced that our newly formed subsidiary, KeRail Inc. (KeRail), entered into a long-term agreement with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd. (TSMC), for KeRail to provide rail transportation services to the direct shipping iron ore mine TSMC is developing near Schefferville, Quebec in the Labrador Trough (the Mine).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	In addition, KeRail will construct an approximately 21 -kilometer rail line (Rail Line) that will connect the Mine to the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation (TSH) interchange point in Schefferville.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Operated as part of our Canada Region, KeRail will haul unit trains of iron ore from its rail connection with the Mine, which will then travel over three privately owned railways to the Port of Sept- les for export primarily to Tata Steel Limited's European operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	The agreement and construction are contingent on certain conditions being met, including the receipt of necessary governmental permits and approvals.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	Once the track construction commences, the Rail Line is expected to be completed three to six months thereafter.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	In June 2009, we announced that our subsidiary, Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY), intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Consequently, in the second quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $5.4 million after-tax associated with HCRY.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	These charges reflected a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and restructuring charges of $2.3 million and were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	In September 2010, the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario agreed to provide C $30 million (or $30 million at the December 31, 2012 exchange rate) to fund infrastructure improvements that, combined with certain customer agreements, will enable HCRY to continue operations on a long-term basis.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	In addition, HCRY committed to fund approximately C $3 million (or $3 million at the December 31, 2012 exchange rate) for infrastructure improvements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a result, we reversed $2.3 million ( $1.5 million after-tax) of accrued restructuring charges related to HCRY in September 2010, as HCRY no longer intends to cease its operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Because of the substance of the temporary agreement HCRY was operating under from August 15, 2009 through December 31, 2010, HCRY s net operating earnings were included within non-freight revenues as other operating income.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	On January 1, 2011, HCRY began operating under a new agreement with certain customers.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Because of the substance of the new arrangement, on January 1, 2011, we resumed reporting HCRY s operating revenues, including freight revenues and corresponding carloads, and operating expenses within each respective line item of our statement of operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Purchase Price Allocation We accounted for the RailAmerica, AZER and FreightLink acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Under the acquisition method of accounting:
1012620_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The assets and liabilities of RailAmerica were recorded at their respective estimated acquisition-date fair values by RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012, which is referred to as the application of push-down accounting, and were included in G W's consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date (see RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Upon receipt of approval from the STB to control RailAmerica, our preliminary allocation of fair value to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with our assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2012 (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Between October 1, 2012 and December 28, 2012, we recognized income from our equity investment in RailAmerica of $15.6 million and other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million , primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, we recognized $21.8 million , representing the change in RailAmerica's cash and cash equivalents from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012, as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	The final allocation of fair value to RailAmerica's assets and liabilities is subject to completion of an assessment of the acquisition-date fair values of acquired non-current assets, deferred taxes and other tax matters, and contingent liabilities.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The assets and liabilities of AZER and FreightLink were recorded at their respective acquisition-date fair values and were consolidated with those of G W as of their respective acquisition dates (see AZER and FreightLink columns in the following table).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the FreightLink balance sheet to United States dollars was $0.96 for one Australian dollar (which was the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of RailAmerica, AZER and FreightLink were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Discontinued Operations In August 2010, we recognized income from net insurance proceeds of $2.8 million ( $2.8 million after-tax) within discontinued operations related to damages incurred as a result of Hurricane Stan in 2005 by our Mexican operating subsidiary, FCCM, which we sold in August 2009.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	We utilized capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset the tax on this gain.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of Servicios, which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	We do not expect any material future adverse financial impact from Servicios.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Results from Continuing Operations When comparing our results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another, consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to economic conditions, acquisitions, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably warm or cool weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	In periods when these events occur, results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S4	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products as well as product specific economic conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S5	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at customer plants (coal), winter weather (salt and coal) and seasonal rainfall (grain).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P38_S6	As a result of these and other factors, our operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our operating results in other reporting periods.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011 Operating Revenues Overview Operating revenues were $874.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $829.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $45.8 million , or 5.5% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The $45.8 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $22.7 million in revenues from new operations and a $23.1 million , or 2.8% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	New operations are those that were not included in our consolidated financial results for a comparable period in the prior year.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The $23.1 million increase in revenues from existing operations included increases of $20.8 million in freight revenues and $2.3 million in non-freight revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	The following table breaks down our operating revenues and total carloads into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table compares freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands, except average freight revenues per carload):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Total freight traffic decreased 69,954 carloads, or 7.0% , in 2012 compared with 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Carloads from existing operations decreased by 90,735 carloads, or 9.1% , and new operations contributed 20,781 carloads.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	The same railroad traffic decrease was principally due to decreases of 40,401 carloads of other commodity group traffic (primarily overhead coal haulage traffic), 39,522 carloads of coal and coke traffic, 20,054 carloads of farm and food products traffic and 10,952 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, partially offset by increases of 6,241 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 6,115 carloads of lumber and forest products traffic and 4,720 carloads of intermodal traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	All remaining traffic increased by a net 3,118 carloads.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	Average freight revenues per carload increased 15.2% to $674 in 2012 compared with 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	Average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 13.8% to $666 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	Changes in the commodity mix and higher fuel surcharges increased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 5.4% and 0.5%, respectively, partially offset by the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, which decreased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 0.2%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S7	Other than the impacts from these factors, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 8.1%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P41_S8	Average freight revenues per carload were also positively impacted by the changes in the mix of customers within certain commodity groups, primarily coal and coke traffic, metals traffic and other commodities.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table sets forth freight revenues by commodity group segregated into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in freight revenues by commodity group from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates, fuel surcharges, net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Intermodal revenues increased $7.1 million , or 8.1% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Intermodal traffic volume increased 4,720 carloads, or 7.6%, which increased revenues by $6.7 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	The carload increase was primarily due to increased traffic in Australia and a new customer in the southern United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S5	Coal and coke revenues decreased $7.8 million , or 10.1% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S6	Coal and coke traffic volume decreased 39,522 carloads, or 19.2%, which decreased revenues by $16.5 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 11.2%, which increased revenues by $8.7 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S7	The decrease in traffic was driven by customer-specific circumstances (such as temporary plant shut-downs, high inventory and a plant closing) as well as by warm winter weather, low natural gas prices and lower levels of export coal.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S8	Farm and food products revenues decreased $3.9 million , or 5.7% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S9	Farm and food products traffic volume decreased 20,054 carloads, or 16.3%, which decreased revenues by $12.4 million, while average revenues per carload increased 12.6%, which increased revenues by $8.5 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S10	The carload decrease was primarily due to a mechanical failure at an export grain terminal in Australia and a modal shift from rail to truck in the southern United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S11	Because rates for Australian grain traffic have both a fixed and a variable component, the decrease in Australian grain traffic resulted in higher average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S12	Pulp and paper revenues increased $1.2 million , or 1.9% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S13	Average freight revenues per carload increased 2.4%, which increased revenues by $1.4 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P43_S14	Metallic ores revenues increased $14.8 million , or 26.3% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, a metallic ores customer in Australia switched its mode of transportation from using railcars to using containers.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result, our metallic ores traffic count increased 6,048 carloads for an equivalent volume of product shipped.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	Otherwise, metallic ores traffic volume increased 193 carloads, or 0.6%, and average freight revenues per carload increased 25.6%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	The carload increase was primarily due to a new iron ore contract in Australia, partially offset by a decrease in traffic in Canada.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and an increase in long-haul iron ore shipments in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Metals revenues increased $7.0 million , or 13.6% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Average freight revenues per carload increased 11.0%, which increased revenues by $5.7 million, and metals traffic volume increased 2,032 carloads, or 2.3%, which increased revenues by $1.3 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	The carload increase was primarily due to an increase in carloads due to the expansion of a plant we serve in the southern United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to a change in the mix of customer traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	Minerals and stone revenues decreased $2.9 million , or 6.1% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	Minerals and stone traffic volume decreased 10,952 carloads, or 7.9%, which decreased revenues by $3.9 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 2.0%, which increased revenues by $0.9 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S6	The carload decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rock salt shipments due to high stockpiles as a result of mild 2011-2012 winter weather in the northeastern United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S7	Chemicals and plastics revenues increased $1.6 million , or 3.4% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S8	The increase was primarily due to a 3.1% increase in average freight revenues per carload, which increased revenues by $1.5 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S9	Lumber and forest products revenues increased $3.0 million , or 9.4% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S10	Lumber and forest products traffic volume increased 6,115 carloads, or 9.4%, which increased revenues by $3.0 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S11	The carload increase was primarily due to an increase in United States housing starts.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S12	Petroleum products revenues increased $2.3 million , or 8.8% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S13	Petroleum products traffic volume increased 1,614 carloads, or 5.4%, which increased revenues by $1.4 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 3.2%, which increased revenues by $0.8 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S14	Auto and auto parts revenues increased $0.5 million , or 6.2% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S15	Other freight revenues decreased $2.1 million , or 9.5% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S16	Other freight traffic volume decreased 40,401 carloads, or 49.6%, which decreased revenues by $19.6 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 79.3%, which increased revenues by $17.5 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S17	The carload decrease was largely driven by a decline in coal haulage traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S18	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to the change in mix of customer traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P45_S19	The following table compares non-freight revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in non-freight revenues from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Railcar switching revenues increased $5.9 million , or 4.6% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase included a $5.1 million increase in industrial switching revenues primarily due to a new and expanded customer service contracts and a $1.9 million increase in port switching revenues, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease due to the net depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	Car hire and rental income revenues decreased $0.9 million , or 3.9% , primarily due to decreased export coal traffic in the United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	Fuel sales to third parties decreased $6.1 million , or 34.1% , primarily as a result of the sale of our fuel-sales business in the township of Cook, South Australia in July 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	Demurrage and storage revenues increased $3.6 million , or 16.5% , primarily due to an increase in the number of third-party rail cars being stored in the United States and Canada.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	Car repair services revenues decreased $0.5 million , or 6.6% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S7	Other non-freight revenues increased $0.4 million , or 0.7% .

1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S9	The increase in operating expenses was attributable to $33.9 million from existing operations and $13.4 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S10	The increase in existing operations was primarily due to $18.6 million of acquisition-related expenses from the RailAmerica acquisition, $11.5 million of severance costs and expenses from the acceleration of stock-based compensation of RailAmerica employees and a $17.9 million increase in labor and benefits, partially offset by a $7.8 million decrease in equipment rents, $5.6 million increase in net (gain)/loss on the sale and impairment of assets and $4.7 million increase in gain on insurance recoveries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S11	In addition, the net depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar resulted in a $0.8 million decrease in operating expenses from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S12	Operating Ratio Our operating ratio, defined as total operating expenses divided by total operating revenues, was 78.2% in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with 76.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P47_S13	Included in our operating ratio calculation for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $18.6 million of acquisition-related expenses from the RailAmerica acquisition and $11.5 million of severance costs and expenses from the acceleration of stock-based compensation of RailAmerica employees.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a material impact on our operating revenues and operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	However, the net impact of these foreign currency translation effects should not have a material impact on our operating ratio.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table sets forth a comparison of our operating expenses in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Labor and benefits expense was $257.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $236.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $21.5 million , or 9.1% , of which $17.5 million was from existing operations and $4.0 million was from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The increase from existing operations consisted of $8.2 million due to an increase in the average number of employees, $5.9 million from annual wage increases and $3.8 million of benefit increases (health care costs), partially offset by $0.4 million due to the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollar and the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S2	Our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 50 employees compared with our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2011 .

1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S4	The decrease was primarily due to the replacement of leased locomotives in Australia with new owned units and a decrease in freight car rents in the United States, which was partially offset by $1.3 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S5	Purchased services expense, which consists of the costs of services provided by outside contractors for repairs and maintenance of track property, locomotives, freight cars and other equipment as well as contract labor costs for crewing and drayage services, was $80.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $78.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $1.9 million , or 2.4% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S6	The increase was primarily related to increased use of contract services for repairs and maintenance of the locomotive and wagon fleets in Australia, partially offset by the decrease in expense related to the sale of our drayage business in 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S7	Depreciation and amortization expense was $73.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $66.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $6.9 million , or 10.4% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S8	The increase was attributable to a $4.9 million increase from existing operations, primarily due to new locomotives and wagons in Australia, and $2.0 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S9	The cost of diesel fuel used in operations was $88.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $88.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , a decrease of $0.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S10	The decrease was attributable to a $2.6 million decrease in existing operations, partially offset by $2.5 million increase in new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S11	The decrease from existing operations was composed of $5.7 million due to a 6.3% decrease in diesel fuel consumption, primarily related to a 9.1% decrease in carloads, partially offset by $3.1 million from a 3.5% increase in average fuel cost per gallon.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S12	The cost of diesel fuel sold to third parties was $11.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , a decrease of $5.7 million , or 33.3% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P50_S13	The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our fuel-sales business in the township of Cook, South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets was $11.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.3 million gain on sale of land and track in Canada and a $1.8 million gain on sale of certain assets in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	Gain on insurance recoveries in the year ended December 31, 2012 of $5.8 million was related primarily to a business interruption claim associated with the Edith River Derailment (described in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Insurance recoveries in the year ended December 31, 2011 of $1.1 million related to a business interruption claim associated with Cyclone Carlos.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P51_S5	The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in trackage rights and property tax expenses and $1.3 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	RailAmerica acquisition-related costs in the year ended December 31, 2012 of $18.6 million consisted of acquisition and financing-related expenses from the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	RailAmerica integration costs in the year ended December 31, 2012 of $11.5 million consisted primarily of severance costs and expenses from the acceleration of stock-based compensation of RailAmerica employees.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Other Income (Expense) Items Interest Income Interest income was $3.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	Interest Expense Total interest expense was $62.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $38.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our New Credit Agreement entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of RailAmerica, including a $12.6 million make-whole payment resulting from the redemption of pre-existing senior notes, the write-off of $3.2 million of debt issuance costs and higher outstanding debt due to the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	In conjunction with our announcement on July 23, 2012 of our plan to acquire RailAmerica, we entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Carlyle agreed to purchase a minimum of $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible into our Class A common stock in certain circumstances.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	Our closing price was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and, accordingly, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details on the contingent forward sale contract and Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for details regarding the conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract included in our income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 is a non-deductible expense for income tax purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	As a result, our provision for income tax was $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which represents 34.8% of income from continuing operations other than the mark-to-market expense.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Our effective income tax rate was 24.4% in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	The increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the expiration of the Short Line Tax Credit on December 31, 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	On January 2, 2013, the Short Line Tax Credit was extended for 2012 and 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S5	We expect the extension of the Short Line Tax Credit to produce book income tax benefits of approximately $35 million and $25 million for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S6	Since the extension became law in 2013, the 2012 impact will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S7	Income and Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations, net of tax, in the year ended December 31, 2012 was $52.6 million , compared with income from continuing operations, net of tax, of $119.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S8	Our income from continuing operations, net of tax, in the year ended December 31, 2012 included the $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S9	Our basic EPS from continuing operations were $1.13 with 42.7 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with basic EPS from continuing operations of $2.99 with 39.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S10	Our diluted EPS from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.02 with 51.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2011 of $2.79 with 42.8 million weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P54_S11	The weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2012 included 1,066,867 shares as a result of the public offering of Class A common stock and 850,773 shares as a result of the public offering of TEUs, which both took place in September of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our various railroad lines are organized into 11 operating regions.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Since all of the regions have similar characteristics, they previously had been aggregated into one reportable segment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Beginning January 1, 2011, we decided to present our financial information as two reportable segments North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table sets forth our North American European Operations and Australian Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Revenues from our North American European Operations were $585.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $557.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $28.3 million , or 5.1% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The $28.3 million increase in revenues from our North American European Operations included a $24.0 million increase in freight revenues and a $4.2 million increase in non-freight revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The $24.0 million increase in freight revenues consisted of an increase of $2.9 million from existing operations and $21.1 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Operating expenses from our North American European Operations were $470.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $428.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $42.5 million , or 9.9% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The $42.5 million increase in operating expenses from our North American European Operations included $29.1 million from existing operations and $13.4 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	The $29.1 million increase in operating expenses from existing operations was primarily due to an increase of $18.6 million of RailAmerica acquisition-related costs, and an $11.5 million of RailAmerica integration expenses, partially offset by $1.3 million decrease due to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar and the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	Revenues from our Australian Operations were $289.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $271.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $17.5 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S4	The increase in revenues included a $17.8 million increase in freight revenues and a $5.9 million increase in non-freight revenues, partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S5	The $17.8 million increase in freight revenues was primarily driven by a new iron ore contact in South Australia which began in October 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S6	The $5.9 million increase in non-freight revenues was primarily driven by an increased level of activity with existing customers.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S7	The $6.1 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties was primarily due to the sale of our fuel-sales business in the township of Cook, South Australia in July 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S8	Operating expenses from our Australian Operations were $214.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $209.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $4.7 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P58_S9	The increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from the additional resources required to support a new iron ore contract in South Australia, including approximately 50 new employees and additional depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of new equipment, as well as an increase in other operating expenses primarily due to increased trackage rights and property tax expenses, partially offset by higher insurance recoveries in 2012 primarily related to a business interruption claim associated with the Edith River Derailment (described in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and a decrease in equipment rents due to the replacement of leased locomotives with new owned units.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010 Operating Revenues Overview Operating revenues were $829.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $630.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $198.9 million or 31.6%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The $198.9 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $141.8 million in revenues from new operations and an $82.9 million, or 13.2%, increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	New operations are those that were not included in our consolidated financial results for a comparable period in the prior year.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	On a consolidated basis, results from new operations reflected the elimination of $25.8 million of non-freight revenues for services provided to GWA North by GWA.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	The $82.9 million increase in revenues from existing operations included increases of $56.7 million in freight revenues and $26.2 million in non-freight revenues.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	The $82.9 million increase in revenues from existing operations included $26.5 million due to a 6.3% increase in carloads, $17.8 million due to an increase in railcar switching revenues, $10.1 million due to an increase in fuel surcharge revenues, $3.8 million due to an increase in fuel sales to third parties and a benefit of $16.2 million from the impact of foreign currency appreciation.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P59_S6	The following table breaks down our operating revenues and total carloads into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Total freight traffic increased by 133,326 carloads, or 15.4% , in 2011 compared with 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Carloads from existing operations increased by 54,145 carloads, or 6.3% , and new operations contributed 79,181 carloads.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Average freight revenues per carload increased 28.9% to $585 in 2011 compared with 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	Average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 7.7% to $489 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	The impact on average freight revenues per carload driven by changes in the intermodal and metallic ores commodity groups were primarily the result of new operations acquired from FreightLink, which have a relatively longer length of haul than our other operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S5	The increase in average freight revenues per carload from existing operations included a 2.0% benefit from the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S6	In addition, higher fuel surcharges and changes in the commodity mix increased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P61_S7	Other than the impacts from these factors, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 3.1%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table sets forth freight revenues by commodity group segregated into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in freight revenues by commodity group from existing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates, fuel surcharges, appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	Coal and coke revenues increased $3.2 million , or 4.4% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	Average freight revenues per carload increased 2.7%, which increased revenues by $1.9 million, and coal and coke traffic volume increased 3,494 carloads, or 1.7%, which increased revenues by $1.3 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S4	The carload increase was primarily due to increased demand for coal and the return of traffic to power plants that had maintenance and construction-related outages in 2010.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S5	Farm and food products revenues increased $11.5 million , or 20.6% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S6	Farm and food products traffic volume increased 14,485 carloads, or 13.3%, which increased revenues by $7.9 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 6.4%, which increased revenues by $3.6 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S7	The carload increase was primarily due to an increase in export grain traffic in Australia and an increase in grain traffic in the midwestern United States.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S8	The increase in average freight revenues per carload included a benefit of $4.4 million due to the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S9	This benefit was partially offset by a decrease in average freight revenues per carload of 1.4%, which decreased revenues by $0.8 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S10	Because rates for Australian grain traffic have both a fixed and variable component, the increase in Australian grain traffic resulted in lower average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S11	Pulp and paper revenues increased $7.7 million , or 14.3% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S12	Pulp and paper traffic volumes increased 7,745 carloads, or 8.7%, which increased revenues by $4.9 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 5.1%, which increased revenues by $2.8 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S13	The carload increase was primarily due to higher pulpboard traffic in the southeastern United States and 2,730 carloads from HCRY.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S14	Metals revenues increased $12.8 million , or 34.8% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S15	Metals traffic volumes increased 12,495 carloads, or 16.4%, which increased revenues by $7.0 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 15.8%, which increased revenues by $5.8 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P63_S16	The carload increase was primarily due to 8,623 carloads from HCRY and an increase in carloads due to the expansion of a plant we serve in the southeastern United States, partially offset by a decrease in carloads due to start-up issues and low carbon steel demand at a plant we serve in the northeastern United States and truck competition at another plant we serve in the northeastern United States .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Minerals and stone revenues increased $6.9 million , or 16.9% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Minerals and stone average freight revenues per carload increased 8.9%, which increased revenues by $3.7 million, and traffic volumes increased 9,305 carloads, or 7.2%, which increased revenues by $3.2 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increase in average freight revenues per carload included a benefit of $1.5 million due to the appreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	The carload increase was primarily due to the expansion of a plant we serve, an increase in rock salt shipments due to restocking of stockpiles in the northeastern United States and the general improvement in the economy.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P64_S4	Chemicals and plastics revenues increased $4.5 million , or 11.6% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P64_S5	Average freight revenues per carload increased 7.3%, which increased revenues by $2.8 million, and chemicals and plastics traffic volumes increased 2,318 carloads, or 4.1%, which increased revenues by $1.7 million.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our various railroad lines are organized into 10 operating regions.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	Since all of the regions have similar characteristics, they previously had been aggregated into one reportable segment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	Beginning January 1, 2011, we decided to present our financial information as two reportable segments North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P73_S4	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth our North American European Operations and Australian Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Revenues from our North American European Operations were $557.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $494.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $62.8 million, or 12.7%.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	Average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 7.0%, which increased revenues by $23.6 million, and traffic volume from existing operations increased 43,793 carloads, or 5.9%, which increased revenues by $21.4 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S4	The increase in average freight revenues per carload from existing operations included $9.9 million due to a 2.8% increase in fuel surcharge revenues, $1.5 million from the appreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar and a 0.4% increase from the change in mix.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S5	Other than the impacts from these factors, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 3.4%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S6	The $10.8 million increase in non-freight revenues included an increase of $7.6 million in industrial switching revenues primarily as a result of new and expanded customer contracts, a $5.5 increase in port switching revenues primarily due to an increase in export grain and intermodal traffic at our United States port operations and new customers in the Port of Rotterdam, partially offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in demurrage and storage revenues.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S10	The increase in operating expenses from existing operations also included an $8.6 million increase in labor and benefits expense, including $4.6 million due to increased health care costs in the United States, as well as increases due to the hiring of new employees and increased overtime costs, which resulted primarily from increased traffic volumes, and annual wage increases.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S11	Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 included an $8.7 million gain from a legal settlement associated with a past acquisition and $2.3 million due to the reversal of restructuring charges associated with the second quarter 2009 impairment of HCRY.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S17	The $11.7 million increase in freight revenues from existing operations was primarily due to a benefit of $5.8 million from the appreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar and $4.0 million from an increase of 10,352 carloads, or 8.1%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S18	The carload increase was primarily due to export grain traffic.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P75_S19	Operating expenses from our Australian Operations were $209.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , compared with $124.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 , an increase of $84.4 million.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	RailAmerica Equity Method Investment Because we did not control RailAmerica until December 28, 2012, we accounted for the fourth quarter earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	We are providing the following analysis of RailAmerica's fourth quarter 2012 results in order to provide a comparison to its fourth quarter 2011 results.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details on RailAmerica's fourth quarter 2012 results.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	RailAmerica's revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 2.6% to $151.1 million, compared with $147.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increase included $5.9 million from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	RailAmerica's same railroad revenues decreased $2.1 million, or 1.5%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	Same railroad freight revenues increased $3.9 million, or 6.5%, to $110.0 million, with average revenue per carload up 7.6%.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P77_S4	Non-freight revenues declined $6.0 million, or 13.7%, to $38.0 million, primarily due to lower activity at RailAmerica's subsidiary, Atlas Railroad Construction Company (Atlas).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	RailAmerica's traffic in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 214,272 carloads, an increase of 2,424 carloads, or 1.1%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Traffic in the fourth quarter of 2012 included 4,709 carloads from new operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	Same railroad traffic decreased 2,285 carloads, or 1.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	The same railroad traffic decrease was principally due to a decrease of 7,421 carloads, or 18.0%, in coal traffic, partially offset by an increase of 3,127 carloads, or 3.4%, in industrial products traffic (primarily chemicals and petroleum traffic), and an increase of 2,155 carloads, or 4.5%, in agricultural products and food traffic (primarily export soybean traffic).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	All remaining traffic decreased by a net 146 carloads.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S5	RailAmerica's same railroad non-freight revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 decreased by $8.9 million, or 20.1%, to $35.1 million, compared with same railroad non-freight revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $44.0 million, primarily due to an $11.5 million decrease in Atlas' construction activities.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S6	RailAmerica's operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $26.1 million, a decrease of $11.1 million, compared with $37.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S7	RailAmerica's operating ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 82.7%, compared with an operating ratio of 74.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S8	RailAmerica's operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 included $1.4 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from our acquisition accounting for RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S9	If the RailAmerica a cquisition had occurred in 2011, RailAmerica's operating income in the fourth quarter of 2011 would have had incremental depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $1 million.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S10	Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2012 also included $5.7 million of acquisition-related expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S11	In the fourth quarter of 2011, operating income benefited by $3.6 million from the sale of short line tax credits and included $0.3 million of acquisition-related expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P78_S12	Excluding these items and the estimated acquisition-driven incremental depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2011, RailAmerica's operating income would have been $31.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with $33.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and its operating ratio would have been 78.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with 77.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table sets forth RailAmerica's railroad freight revenue, volume and freight revenues per carload for the three months ended December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands, except average freight revenues per carload):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $64.8 million and $27.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Based on current expectations, we believe our cash and other liquid assets, anticipated future cash flows, availability under our credit facility, access to debt and equity capital markets and sources of available financing will be sufficient to fund expected operating, capital and debt service requirements and other financial commitments for the foreseeable future.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	At December 31, 2012 , we had long-term debt, including current portion, of $1,858.1 million , which comprised 49.5% of our total capitalization, and $396.3 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	At December 31, 2011 , we had long-term debt, including current portion, totaling $626.2 million , which comprised 39.5% of our total capitalization and $227.2 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	As more fully described in Note 3 and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the acquisition of RailAmerica was financed through borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, public offerings of shares of our Class A common stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) and a private issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	As part of the financing for the RailAmerica acquisition, on October 1, 2012, we completed the issuance of 350,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at an issuance price of $1,000.00 per share to Carlyle pursuant to the Investment Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The net proceeds from this issuance were $349.4 million after issuance costs.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 5.00% per annum of the issuance price per share.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Each share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into approximately 17.1 shares of Class A common stock, subject to customary conversion adjustments.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Series A-1 Preferred Stock was also convertible into the relevant number of shares of Class A common stock on the second anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	Furthermore, we had the option to convert some or all of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock prior to the second anniversary of the date of issuance of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the closing price of our Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange exceeds 130% of the conversion price (or $76.03 ) for 30 consecutive trading days, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S3	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S4	As the closing price of our Class A common stock exceeded $76.03 for 30 consecutive trading days as of February 12, 2013, we converted all of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock on February 13, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S5	These shares were included in our weighted average diluted common shares outstanding in calculating EPS for 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S6	On the conversion date, we paid Carlyle cash in lieu of fractional shares and accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in an amount equal to $2.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S7	Following the conversion, we will not incur the quarterly dividend of approximately $4.4 million that would otherwise have been due on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S8	During 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , we generated $170.8 million , $173.5 million and $171.8 million , respectively, of cash from operating activities from continuing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S9	Changes in working capital decreased net cash flows from operating activities by $30.9 million , $36.8 million and $18.5 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S10	Of the $30.9 million for 2012 , $30.1 million was due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S11	The $30.1 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses included $9.1 million associated with the settlement of a cross-currency swap that matured in December 2012 and $6.3 million in net cash payments related to the December 2011 Edith River derailment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S12	Of the $36.8 million change in working capital for 2011 , $25.6 million was due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $12.3 million was due to an increase in accounts receivable driven by an increase in business in 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P83_S13	The $25.6 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses included $13.0 million associated with the payment of Australian stamp duty for the acquisition of FreightLink in Australia and $10.5 million due to the timing of the payment of Australian income taxes.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P84_S12	Each installment constitutes a payment of interest (at an annual rate of 4.50% ) and a partial repayment of principal on the Amortizing Note.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P84_S13	The Amortizing Notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of October 1, 2015 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P84_S14	If we elect to settle the Purchase Contracts early, holders of the Amortizing Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders' Amortizing Notes, except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the Amortizing Notes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P84_S15	Unless settled or redeemed earlier, each Purchase Contract will automatically settle on October 1, 2015 (subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances) and we will deliver a number of shares of our Class A common stock based on the applicable market value of our Class A common stock, as defined in the Purchase Contract, which will be between 1.2355 shares and 1.5444 shares (subject to adjustment) per each $100 stated amount of the TEUs based on our share price at the time of settlement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Each TEU may be separated into its constituent Purchase Contract and Amortizing Note after the initial issuance date of the TEU, and the separate components may be combined to create a TEU.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Amortizing Note component of the TEU is recorded as debt and the Purchase Contract component of the TEU is recorded in equity as additional paid-in capital.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	On September 19, 2012, we recorded $197.6 million , the initial fair value of the Purchase Contracts, as additional paid-in capital, and was partially offset by $6.1 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	Our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the weighted average shares issuable upon settlement of the Purchase Contract component of the TEUs.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P85_S4	For purposes of determining the number of shares included in the calculation, we used the market price of our Class A common stock at the period end date.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	RailAmerica Acquisition and Related Financing On October 1, 2012, we announced the closing of our acquisition of RailAmerica and entered into the New Credit Agreement, which is comprised of a $1.9 billion term loan and a $425.0 million revolving loan.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The acquisition was financed through borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, public offerings of shares of our Class A common stock and TEUs and a private issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	We financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's shares, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of our and RailAmerica's debt, as well as transaction and financing-related expenses, with $1.8 billion of debt from our New Credit Agreement, $475.5 million of gross proceeds from our recent public offerings of Class A common stock and TEUs and $350.0 million through the private issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	On October 1, 2012, in connection with the RailAmerica acquisition, we repaid in full all outstanding loans, together with interest and all other amounts due under our previously outstanding credit agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S4	In addition, we repaid in full our Series B senior notes on October 1, 2012, along with an aggregate $12.6 million make-whole payment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S5	In connection with the repayment of the Prior Credit Agreement and our outstanding notes, we wrote off $3.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S6	At December 31, 2012 , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $64.8 million , of which $33.6 million was held in our foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S7	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S8	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of their respective countries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S9	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S10	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries; however, the amount of the tax and credits is not practically determinable.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S11	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 was $251.4 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S12	The New Credit Agreement expanded the size of our credit facilities from $750.0 million to $2.3 billion and has a maturity date of October 1, 2017 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S13	The New Credit Agreement includes a $425.0 million revolving loan, a $1.6 billion United States term loan, a C$24.6 million ( $25.0 million at the exchange rate on October 1, 2012) Canadian term loan and an A$202.9 million ( $210.0 million at the exchange rate on October 1, 2012) Australian term loan.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S14	The revolving loan also includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S15	The New Credit Agreement provides for borrowings under the revolving facility in United States dollars, Euros, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S16	Under the revolving facility, the applicable borrowing spread for the United States base rate loans and Canadian base rate loans under the New Credit Agreement will initially be 1.50% over the base rate through December 31, 2012 and will range from 0.50% to 1.75% over the base rate depending upon our total leverage ratio thereafter.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S17	The applicable borrowing spread for the United States LIBOR rate loans, Canadian LIBOR rate loans, the Australian loans and the European loans will initially be 2.50% over the LIBOR rate through December 31, 2012 and will range from 1.50% to 2.75% over the LIBOR rate depending upon our total leverage ratio as determined at the end of any applicable measurement period thereafter.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S18	As of December 31, 2012 , the United States, Australian and Canadian term loans had interest rates of 2.71% , 5.65% and 3.55% , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P86_S19	On December 31, 2012 , the Company had outstanding revolving loans of $11.0 million in the United States with an interest rate of 2.71% , A$10.0 million in Australia (or $10.4 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) with an interest rate of 5.65% and 2.9 million in Europe (or $3.8 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) with an interest rate of 2.56% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the new revolving credit facility.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	The commitment fee rate will initially be 0.50% per annum through December 31, 2012 and will range from 0.25% to 0.50% depending upon our total leverage ratio thereafter.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	We will also pay customary letter of credit and agency fees.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The United States term loan will amortize in quarterly installment amounts of $16.4 million for the first eight quarterly payments beginning December 31, 2012, $21.9 million for the succeeding eight quarterly payments and $43.7 million for the next succeeding quarterly periods through September 30, 2017 with the remaining principal balance of the term loan payable on October 1, 2017.

1012620_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	In addition to the quarterly installment amounts, during the three months ended December 31, 2012, we repaid $47.5 million of the United States term loan, C$10.0 million (or $10.0 million at the exchange rate on October 31, 2012) on the Canadian term loan and A$18.0 million (or $18.6 million at the exchange rate on October 25, 2012) on the Australian term loan.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P88_S4	The New Credit Agreement also includes (a) a $45.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and (b) sub-limits for swingline loans including (i) up to $30.0 million under the United States revolving loan, (ii) up to $15.0 million under each of the Canadian revolving loan and the Australian revolving loan and (iii) up to $10.0 million under the Euro revolving loan.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The New Credit Agreement contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or prohibit our ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness; create liens; make investments; pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock; consolidate or merge or make acquisitions or dispose of assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in any business unrelated to the business currently conducted by us; sell or issue capital stock of any of our restricted subsidiaries; change the fiscal year; enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Under the New Credit Agreement we must have an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	In addition, we may not exceed specified maximum total leverage ratios as described in the following table:
1012620_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we were in compliance with the provisions of the covenant requirements of the New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our $425.0 million revolving loan consisted of $25.2 million of outstanding debt, subsidiary letters of credit guarantees of $3.6 million and $396.3 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	Subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants in the New Credit Agreement, the $396.3 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2012 is available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted investments, permitted acquisitions, refinancing existing indebtedness and general corporate purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	On July 29, 2011 , we entered into the Prior Credit Agreement which replaced our credit agreement then in effect.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The Prior Credit Agreement expanded the borrowing capacity of our senior credit facility from $620.0 million to $750.0 million and extended the maturity date to July 29, 2016 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Australian term loan and a C $23.6 million ( $25.0 million at the July 29, 2011 exchange rate) Canadian term loan.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Prior Credit Agreement allowed for borrowings in United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	As described above, in connection with the RailAmerica acquisition, we repaid in full all outstanding loans, together with interest and all other amounts due under the Prior Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	No penalties were due in connection with such repayments.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P93_S4	In connection with the repayment of the Prior Credit Agreement, we wrote off $2.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and incurred $0.5 million of legal expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Senior Notes In 2005, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million of Series B senior notes and $25.0 million of Series C senior notes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Series C senior notes had a borrowing rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.70% and were repaid in July 2012 through borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	The Series B senior notes bore interest at 5.36% and were due in July 2015 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	On October 1, 2012, we repaid the $100.0 million of Series B senior notes, along with an aggregate $12.6 million make-whole payment, with proceeds from the New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	In addition, we wrote off $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S5	In 2004, we completed a $75.0 million private placement of Series A senior notes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S6	The Series A senior notes bore interest at 4.85% and matured in November 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P94_S7	On November 1, 2011, we repaid the $75.0 million of senior notes through $67.0 million of borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement and $8.0 million from cash and cash equivalents.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	In 2010, as part of the FreightLink Acquisition, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A $1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A $50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010 ) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the carrying value of the loan was $2.2 million with an effective interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Edith River Derailment On December 27, 2011, a train operated by our subsidiary, GWA, derailed on the Edith River Bridge in Australia's Northern Territory (the Edith River Derailment).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Flood waters associated with heavy rainfall from Cyclone Grant washed away the southern portion of the Edith River Bridge while a northbound GWA intermodal train consisting of three locomotives, an unoccupied crew van and 33 wagons was passing over the bridge en route to Darwin.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	The locomotives were damaged and the crew van and several intermodal containers and wagons containing copper concentrate were derailed into the river.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	The railroad segment between Katherine and Darwin remained out of service for approximately 60 days.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Edith River Bridge reopened on February 29, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	The 60-day closure of the Edith River Bridge reduced our revenues by approximately $7 million , primarily in the first quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	In June 2012, we recorded a gain on insurance recoveries and a related insurance receivable of A$4.8 million (or $4.8 million at the average exchange rate on June 30, 2012) for a business interruption claim.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	This recovery represents a partial recovery of the total expected business interruption claim.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	Additional recovery is expected in 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	In December 2011, we recorded a liability of A$15.0 million (or $15.3 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2011) for the estimated repair and related costs associated with the Edith River Derailment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S4	Since we believe substantially all of these costs will be recovered through insurance, we also recorded a receivable of A$14.0 million (or $14.3 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2011), with the difference representing our insurance deductible.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S5	We increased our estimate of costs associated with the Edith River Derailment, as well as our estimate of insurance recovery, each by A$12.8 million (or $13.3 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S6	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 , we made cash payments of A$26.3 million (or $27.3 million at the average exchange rate during the period) as a result of the derailment and received cash proceeds from insurance of A$22.1 million (or $20.9 million at the exchange rate on the date received).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S7	As of December 31, 2012 , our outstanding insurance receivable associated with repair costs was A$4.7 million (or $4.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S8	We believe it is possible that additional claims related to the Edith River Derailment may arise and additional costs may be incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S9	We are unable to estimate the range of such claims based on currently available information.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P98_S10	However, we do not anticipate that these additional claims or costs, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for rail cars, locomotives and other equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , we leased 10,307 rail cars and 7 locomotives (not including RailAmerica's leased locomotives).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	Related operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $13.4 million , $19.0 million and $13.1 million , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , RailAmerica leased 8,004 rail cars and 175 locomotives.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	We lease certain real property, which resulted in operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 of $4.9 million , $4.6 million and $5.0 million , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers to operate over various rail lines in North America.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	Under certain other of these leases, no payments to the lessors are required as long as certain operating conditions are met.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	No material payments were required under these lease agreements in 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties (e.g., customers) for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P102_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments that could affect our financial condition.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	(3) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $0.9 million and the fair value of our cross-currency swap of $0.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	(4) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	(5) Includes estimated casualty obligations of $13.6 million , deferred compensation of $8.5 million , locomotive parts purchase obligations of $4.5 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $1.8 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P106_S3	In addition, the table includes estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $6.9 million and our 2013 estimated contributions of $0.6 million to our pension plans.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P106_S4	(6) Table excludes any reserves for income taxes under U.S. GAAP because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our unrecognized tax benefits beyond 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P106_S5	As of December 31, 2012, our reserves for income taxes totaled approximately $4.0 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2012 consisted of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses When comparing the effects on revenues of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2012 versus the year ended December 31, 2011 , foreign currency translation had an overall negative impact on our consolidated revenues due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar and the Euro relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	Since the world s major crude oil and refined products are traded in United States dollars, we believe there was little, if any, impact of foreign currency translation on our fuel sales to third parties in Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	Currency effects related to operating revenues and expenses are presented within the discussion of these respective items included within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	We account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P111_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P111_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	Major renewals or improvements, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge s capacity to carry increased loads and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P113_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P113_S3	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	As a result, we typically incur minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P114_S4	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P115_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Estimated Useful Life (in Years) Property:
1012620_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P118_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P118_S4	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment, since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year, and no impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P120_S2	Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	We first compare the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including our assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S4	RailAmerica's liability and property insurance coverage will remain in place until our annual insurance renewal later in 2013, following which it is expected that all of our operations will be under one insurance program.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S5	Our primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S6	RailAmerica's primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence as of December 28, 2012, and prior self-insured retentions have been as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S7	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S8	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S9	Accruals for FELA claims by our railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P126_S10	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	Our property damage policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	RailAmerica's primary property damage policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P127_S2	The property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P127_S3	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for grants to our employees under our Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P128_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P128_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P128_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on historical and implied volatility.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.9 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	We also recorded an additional $4.1 million of costs from the acceleration of equity awards for certain terminated employees related to the integration of RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , the compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $20.7 million , which will be recognized over the next three years with a weighted average period of 1.7 years.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S3	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards, including the benefit recognized from the acceleration of equity awards related to the integration of RailAmerica, was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2011 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.7 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S5	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2010 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P131_S7	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P132_S1	Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P132_S2	In our consolidated balance sheets, these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	A deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards, is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, our deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 was $251.4 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7_P136_S3	Other Uncertainties Our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward-looking statements.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P136_S4	For a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations, see Part 1.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject, and the financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented.
1012620_13_ITEM7_P137_S2	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Risk Sensitivity Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	(1) Includes a $50.0 million (or $52.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 assumed in the FreightLink Acquisition with a carrying value of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2012 with an effective interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using United States LIBOR, Australia BBSW, Canadian LIBOR and Euro LIBOR (as of December 31, 2012 ).
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 2.50% for United States, Australian, Canadian and European borrowings under our New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $2.4 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Furthermore, if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment, we believe we would incur interest rates no worse, and potentially better, than our current rates.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments We apply the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value:
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Since our long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, the future interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	These agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	To value the interest rate swaps, a discounted cash flow model is utilized.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The swap has a notional amount of $120.0 million and requires us to pay a fixed rate of 3.88% on the notional amount.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	In return, we receive one-month LIBOR on the notional amount of the swap, which is equivalent to our variable rate obligation on the notional amounts under the New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P10_S3	This swap expires on September 30, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into multiple interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of the interest rate swap agreements (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	On November 9, 2012, we entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	On the date of the hedge designation, September 30, 2016 , it is probable that we will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under our commercial banking lines.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P12_S2	The forward starting interest swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P12_S3	We expect any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P12_S4	The swaps have a notional amount of $300.0 million and require us to pay a fixed rate of 2.79% and receive three-month LIBOR on the notional amount over a 10-year period expiring September 30, 2026 .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P12_S5	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Our effectiveness testing during the year ended December 31, 2012 , resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings, as more fully described in Note 17 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , $220.9 million of third-party debt related to our foreign operations was denominated in the currencies in which our subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P14_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P14_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P14_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid from our foreign operations, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P14_S4	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from our United States operations to our foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business to the extent such acquisition is funded with United States dollars.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P14_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P15_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P16_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P16_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(expense), net.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S0	On December 1, 2010, we completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S1	We financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement then in effect.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S2	On November 24, 2010, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, with funds to be delivered on December 1, 2010, to secure an exchange rate for A$45 million of the A$331.9 million purchase of the FreightLink assets.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S3	The subsequent decrease in the value of Australian dollar versus the United States dollar between November 24, 2010 and December 1, 2010 and its impact on the A$45 million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of $0.7 million within other (expense)/income, net.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S4	In addition, a portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to Australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of A$105.0 million (or $100.6 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S5	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan, we entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P17_S6	The Swap required us to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.125% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allowed us to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.48% based on a notional amount of $100.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P18_S0	BBSW is the wholesale interbank reference rate within Australia, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P18_S1	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, we realized a net expense of $4.4 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P18_S2	In addition, we recognized a net gain of $0.6 million within other income/(expense) related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P18_S3	The Swap expired on December 1, 2012 and was settled for $9.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P19_S0	On November 29, 2012, simultaneous with the termination of the existing swap, we entered into two new 2-year Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), effective December 3, 2012 and expires on December 1, 2014.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P19_S1	The Swaps effectively convert the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $109.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P19_S2	The Swaps require us to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.25% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allow us to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.82% based on a notional amount of $109.6 million on a quarterly basis.

1012620_13_ITEM7A_P20_S0	The following table presents our financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P21_S0	In conjunction with our announcement on July 23, 2012 of our plan to acquire RailAmerica, we entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P21_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we agreed to sell to Carlyle a minimum of $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S0	Each share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into approximately 17.1 shares of Class A common stock, subject to customary conversion adjustments.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The Series A-1 Preferred Stock was also convertible into the relevant number of shares of Class A common stock on the second anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S2	Furthermore, we had the option to convert some or all of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock prior to the second anniversary of the date of issue of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the closing price of our Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded 130% of the conversion price (or $76.03 ) for 30 consecutive trading days, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S3	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium in our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S4	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S5	As a result of the significant increase in our share price between July 23, 2012 and the end of the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense to the Investment Agreement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P22_S6	The closing price of our Class A common stock was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P23_S0	As the closing price of our Class A common stock exceeded $76.03 for 30 consecutive trading days as of February 12, 2013, we converted the $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock on February 13, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P23_S1	These shares were included in our weighted average diluted common shares outstanding in calculating EPS for 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P23_S2	On the conversion date, we paid to Carlyle cash in lieu of fractional shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in an amount equal to $2.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P23_S3	Following the conversion, we will not incur the quarterly dividend of approximately $4.4 million that would otherwise have been due on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P23_S4	See Note 24 , Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further information relating to the conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into our Class A common stock.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P24_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P24_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2012 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 12.9% of our total expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P24_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P24_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_13_ITEM7A_P24_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $0.9 million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In making its assessment of changes in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, management has excluded RailAmerica, which was acquired in a purchase business combination during the three months ended December 31, 2012.

1012620_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1012620_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P51_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P52_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded RailAmerica, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination on October 1, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	We have also excluded RailAmerica, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Unless the context otherwise requires, when used in these financial statements, the terms Genesee Wyoming, G W and the Company refer to Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries, including RailAmerica, Inc. and its subsidiaries (RailAmerica).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P59_S2	G W acquired RailAmerica on October 1, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P59_S3	However, the shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered the Company's control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P59_S4	Accordingly, the Company accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and the Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P59_S5	All references to currency amounts included in these financial statements are in United States dollars unless specifically noted otherwise.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company owns and operates short line and regional railroads in the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	In addition, the Company operates the 1,400 mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin with the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	Operations currently include 111 railroads organized into 11 regions, with approximately 14,700 miles of owned and leased track, approximately 4,600 employees and over 2,000 customers.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company provides rail service at 35 ports in North America, Australia and Europe and performs contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , for descriptions of the Company s changes in operations in recent years.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company's railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	Freight revenues from the Company s 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 25% , 24% and 22% of the Company s operating revenues in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P62_S2	Freight revenues from RailAmerica's 10 largest freight customers accounted for approximately 13% of their operating revenues in 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P62_S3	The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P62_S4	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P62_S5	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	Revenue Recognition Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company s tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies consist of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	Materials and supplies are removed from inventory using the average cost method.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Business Combinations The Company accounts for businesses it acquires using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company records the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	As part of this process, the Company identifies and attributes values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P67_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P67_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P68_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P68_S3	Major renewals or improvements are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company s short line and regional railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P70_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P70_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P70_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company s major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	When factors indicate that assets may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P72_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 or 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment review as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company s assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P78_S3	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company is required to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims The Company maintains property and liability insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S1	RailAmerica's liability and property insurance coverage will remain in place until the Company's annual insurance renewal later in 2013, following which it is expected that all of the Company's operations will be under one insurance program.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Company s primary liability policies currently have a self-insured retention of up to $0.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S3	RailAmerica's primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence as of December 28, 2012, and prior self-insured retentions have been as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S4	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S5	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company s liability policies.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S6	Accruals for Federal Employment Liability Act (FELA) claims by the Company s railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P81_S7	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company s property damage policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	RailAmerica's primary property damage policies currently have self-insurance retentions of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	The property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of its United States subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	Each of the Company s foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of their respective countries.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to the Company s employees through the Company s Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P87_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective terms as directors.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P87_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P87_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value:
1012620_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries were prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	Currency translation adjustments are reflected within the equity section of the balance sheet and are included in other comprehensive income.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations upon substantial or complete liquidation of the underlying investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P96_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	Risks and Uncertainties While the global economy has recovered in recent years from the significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009 that included widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based or sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to the Company.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P97_S2	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact the Company s customers, suppliers and business in general.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	3. CHANGES IN OPERATIONS: United States RailAmerica, Inc.: On October 1, 2012 , the Company acquired 100% of RailAmerica, Inc.'s (RailAmerica) outstanding shares for cash at a price of $27.50 per share and in connection with such acquisition, the Company repaid RailAmerica's term loan and revolving credit facility.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	The calculation of the total consideration for the RailAmerica acquisition is presented below (dollars in thousands, except per share amount):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	The Company financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's common stock, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of the Company's and RailAmerica's outstanding debt prior to the acquisition, as well as transaction and financing related expenses with approximately $1.9 billion of debt from a new five-year Senior Secured Credit Syndicated Facility Agreement (the New Credit Agreement) (See Note 9 , Long-Term Debt ), $475.5 million of gross proceeds from the Company's public offerings of Class A common stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Share ) and $350.0 million through a private issuance of mandatorily convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Share and Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments ).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered the Company's control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	Accordingly, the Company accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and the Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and is included in the Company's North American and European Operations segment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P101_S2	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a new accounting basis was established for RailAmerica on October 1, 2012 for its stand-alone financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P101_S3	Condensed consolidated financial information for RailAmerica as of and for the period ended December 28, 2012 is included in Note 8 , Equity Investment .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P101_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , as discussed more fully under Contingent Forward Sale Contract in Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , the Company recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition (the Investment Agreement).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P101_S5	The expense resulted from the significant increase in the Company's share price between July 23, 2012 (the date the Company entered into the Investment Agreement) and September 28, 2012 (the last trading date prior to issuing the stock).

1012620_13_ITEM15_P116_S1	In addition, KeRail will construct an approximately 21 -kilometer rail line (Rail Line) that will connect the Mine to the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation (TSH) interchange point in Schefferville.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P116_S2	Operated as part of the Company's Canada Region, KeRail will haul unit trains of iron ore from its rail connection with the Mine, which will then travel over three privately owned railways to the Port of Sept- les for export primarily to Tata Steel's European operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P116_S3	The agreement and construction are contingent on certain conditions being met, including the receipt of necessary governmental permits and approvals.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P116_S4	Once the track construction has commenced, the Rail Line is expected to be completed three to six months thereafter.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	In June 2009, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY), intended to cease its operations in the third quarter of 2009.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P117_S1	Consequently, in the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded charges of $5.4 million after-tax associated with HCRY.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P117_S2	These charges reflected a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and restructuring charges of $2.3 million and were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	In September 2010, the governments of Canada and the Province of Ontario agreed to provide C$30 million (or $30 million at the December 31, 2012 exchange rate) to fund infrastructure improvements that, combined with certain customer agreements, will enable HCRY to continue operations on a long-term basis.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P118_S1	In addition, HCRY committed to fund approximately C$3 million (or $3 million at the December 31, 2012 exchange rate) of infrastructure improvements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P118_S2	As a result, the Company reversed $2.3 million ( $1.5 million after-tax) of accrued restructuring charges related to HCRY in September 2010, as HCRY no longer intends to cease its operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P118_S3	Because of the substance of the temporary agreement HCRY was operating under from August 15, 2009 through December 31, 2010, HCRY s net operating earnings were included within non-freight revenues as other operating income.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	On January 1, 2011, HCRY began operating under a new agreement with certain customers.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	Because of the substance of the new arrangement, on January 1, 2011, the Company resumed reporting HCRY s operating revenues, including freight revenues and corresponding carloads, and operating expenses within each respective line item of the statement of operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company accounted for the RailAmerica, AZER and FreightLink acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P120_S1	Under the acquisition method of accounting:
1012620_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	The assets and liabilities of RailAmerica were recorded at their respective estimated acquisition-date fair values by RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012, which is referred to as the application of push-down accounting, and were included in G W's consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date (see RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	Upon approval of the STB to control RailAmerica, the preliminary allocation of fair value to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with the Company's assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2012 (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	Between October 1, 2012 and December 28, 2012, the Company recognized income from its equity investment in RailAmerica of $15.6 million and other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P123_S1	In addition, the Company recognized $21.8 million , representing the change in RailAmerica's cash and cash equivalents from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012, as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P123_S2	The final allocation of fair value to RailAmerica's assets and liabilities is subject to completion of an assessment of the acquisition-date fair values of acquired non-current assets, deferred taxes and other tax matters, and contingent liabilities.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	The assets and liabilities of AZER and FreightLink were recorded at their respective acquisition-date fair values and were consolidated with those of G W as of their respective acquisition dates (see AZER and FreightLink columns in the following table).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the FreightLink balance sheet to United States dollars was $0.96 for one Australian dollar (which was the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	The fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of RailAmerica, AZER and FreightLink were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	Discontinued Operations In August 2010, the Company recognized income from net insurance proceeds of $2.8 million ( $2.8 million after-tax) within discontinued operations related to damages incurred as a result of Hurricane Stan in 2005 by the Company's Mexican operating subsidiary, Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab, S.A. de C.V. (FCCM), which was sold in August 2009.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P127_S1	The Company utilized capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset the tax on this gain.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of our remaining Mexican subsidiary, GW Servicios S.A. (Servicios), which were classified as discontinued operations, were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P128_S1	The Company does not expect any material future adverse financial impact from its remaining Mexican subsidiary.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P128_S2	See Note 22 , Discontinued Operations , for additional information regarding the Company s discontinued operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	Results from Continuing Operations When comparing the Company s results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to changing economic conditions, acquisitions, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably warm or cool weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P129_S1	In periods when these events occur, results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P129_S2	Finally, certain of the Company s railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products, as well as product specific economic conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P129_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at customer plants (coal), winter weather (salt and coal) and seasonal rainfall (grain).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P129_S4	As a result of these and other factors, the Company s operating results in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to its operating results in other reporting periods.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s unaudited pro forma operating results for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , as if the acquisition of RailAmerica had been consummated as of January 1, 2011 and the FreightLink Acquisition was consummated as of January 1, 2009.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P130_S1	The following pro forma financial statements do not include the impact of any potential operating efficiencies, savings from expected synergies, costs to integrate the operations or costs necessary to achieve savings from expected synergies or the impact of derivative instruments that the Company has entered into or may enter into to mitigate interest rate or currency exchange rate risk (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	The 2012 and 2011 unaudited pro forma operating results include the acquisition of RailAmerica adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets based on the assignment of fair values, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to amendments to the Company s prior credit agreement and the elimination of RailAmerica's interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S1	The unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were based upon the Company s historical consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and RailAmerica's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the three months ended December 28, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S2	Since the pro forma financial results for 2012 and 2011 assume the acquisition of RailAmerica was consummated on January 1, 2011, the 2011 results included $14.5 million , net of tax, of acquisition-related costs incurred by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2012, $12.9 million , net of tax, of acquisition-related costs incurred by RailAmerica during the year ended December 31, 2012 and approximately $9 million , net of tax, of fees associated with the financing transactions associated with the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S3	In addition, the pro forma results for 2012 included approximately $55 million of costs incurred by RailAmerica associated with the redemption of senior secured notes in January 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S4	As a result of these charges, the numerator used in the calculation of pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by the Series A-1 Preferred Stock dividend and the denominator excluded approximately 6.0 million "if-converted" shares related to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S5	The 2010 unaudited pro forma operating results include the FreightLink Acquisition adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the property and equipment assets based on the assignment of fair values, an adjustment to interest income for the reduction in available cash and cash equivalents due to the use of cash on hand to fund the acquisition, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to amendments to the Company s prior credit agreement, the elimination of FreightLink s deferred grant income for a liability not acquired and the elimination of FreightLink s interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S6	In addition, 2010 unaudited pro forma operating results included an additional tax provision to report FreightLink as a tax paying entity using the Australian statutory income tax rate of 30% .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S7	The Company s 2010 results included $11.6 million of revenues and a net loss of $10.3 million from GWA North for the month of December.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P131_S8	The $10.3 million net loss included A$11.8 million , net of tax ( $11.5 million , net of tax, at the December 1, 2010 exchange rate) of stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax), which was directly attributable to the acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P132_S0	FreightLink s fiscal year end was June 30 and the Company s fiscal year end is December 31.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P132_S1	Since FreightLink and the Company had different fiscal year end dates, the unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements were prepared based on comparable periods.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P132_S2	The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, was based upon the Company s consolidated statement of operations, which includes one month of GWA North s results and the sum of FreightLink s historical quarterly statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, 2010, and two months ended November 30, 2010.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P132_S3	The foreign exchange rates used to translate FreightLink s statements of operations to United States dollars were $0.90 , $0.88 , $0.91 and $0.99 for one Australian dollar for the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, 2010, and two months ended November 30, 2010, respectively (which were calculated based on average daily exchange rates during each of those periods).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P132_S4	The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of the assumed dates and for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P133_S0	Common shares issuable under unexercised stock options calculated under the treasury stock method, weighted average Class B common shares outstanding and Series A-1 Preferred Stock were the only reconciling items between the Company s basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P133_S1	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P134_S0	The total number of options used to calculate weighted average share equivalents for diluted earnings per share as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , was as follows (in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P135_S0	The following total number of shares of Class A common stock issuable under the assumed exercises and lapse of stock-based awards computed based on the treasury stock method were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	On September 19, 2012, the Company completed a public offering of 3,791,004 shares of Class A common stock at $64.75 per share, which included 525,000 shares issued as a result of the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P172_S0	On July 29, 2011 , the Company entered into the Prior Credit Agreement, which replaced the Company's credit agreement then in effect.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P172_S1	The Prior Credit Agreement expanded the borrowing capacity of the Company s senior credit facility from $620.0 million to $750.0 million and extended the maturity date to July 29, 2016 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P173_S0	Australian term loan and a C $23.6 million ( $25.0 million at the July 29, 2011 exchange rate) Canadian term loan.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	As described above, in connection with the RailAmerica acquisition, the Company repaid in full all outstanding loans, together with interest and all other amounts due under the Prior Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P174_S1	No penalties were due in connection with such repayments.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P174_S2	In connection with the repayment of the Prior Credit Agreement, the Company wrote off $2.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and incurred $0.5 million of legal expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	Senior Notes In 2005, the Company completed a private placement of $100.0 million of Series B senior notes and $25.0 million of Series C senior notes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P175_S1	The Series C senior notes had a borrowing rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.70% and were repaid in July 2012 through borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P175_S2	The Series B senior notes bore interest at 5.36% and were due in July 2015 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P175_S3	On October 1, 2012, the Company redeemed the $100.0 million of Series B senior notes, along with an aggregate $12.6 million make-whole payment, with proceeds from the New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P175_S4	In addition, the Company wrote off $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with its senior notes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P175_S5	In 2004, the Company completed a $75.0 million private placement of Series A senior notes.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P176_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the carrying value of the loan was $2.2 million with an effective interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	The following is a summary of the maturities of long-term debt, including capital leases, as of December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S1	The Company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S2	The Company does not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone, nor does the Company use derivative instruments where it does not have underlying exposures.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S3	Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S4	The Company manages its hedging position and monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S5	Management believes its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the Company s best interest.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S6	However, the Company s use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P178_S7	The Company s instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a hedge of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P179_S1	The portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative used as a cash flow hedge that is offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P179_S2	As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P179_S3	The portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P180_S1	At inception of the hedge and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P180_S2	When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the periods it no longer qualifies as a hedge.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P181_S1	For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P181_S2	The Company believes such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P181_S3	The gains or losses from the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(expense), net.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P182_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P182_S2	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P182_S3	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P184_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure to interest rates on a portion of its outstanding borrowings.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P184_S1	The swap has a notional amount of $120.0 million and requires the Company to pay a fixed rate of 3.88% on the notional amount.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P184_S2	In return, the Company receives one-month LIBOR on the notional amount of the swap, which is equivalent to the Company s variable rate obligation on the notional amounts under the New Credit Agreement.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P184_S3	This swap expires on September 30, 2013 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company entered into multiple interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P185_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of the interest rate swap agreements (dollars in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	On November 9, 2012, the Company entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P186_S1	On the date of the hedge designation, September 30, 2016 , it is probable that the Company will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under its commercial banking lines.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P186_S2	The forward starting interest swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P186_S3	The Company expects any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P186_S4	The swaps have a notional amount of $300.0 million and require the Company to pay a fixed rate of 2.79% and receive three-month LIBOR on the notional amount over a 10-year period expiring September 30, 2026 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P186_S5	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	The Company s effectiveness testing during the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P187_S1	See Note 17 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedges.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , $220.9 million of third-party debt related to the Company s foreign operations was denominated in the currencies in which its subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P188_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P188_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of the Company s debt service payments is limited.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P188_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid from the Company's foreign operations, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P188_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from the Company s United States operations to its foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business to the extent such acquisition is funded with United States dollars.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P188_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P189_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P190_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P190_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income/(expense), net.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	On December 1, 2010, the Company completed the FreightLink Acquisition for A$331.9 million (or $320.0 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S1	The Company financed the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under its credit agreement then in effect.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S2	On November 24, 2010, the Company entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, with funds to be delivered on December 1, 2010, to secure an exchange rate for A$45 million of the A$331.9 million purchase of the FreightLink assets.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S3	The subsequent decrease in the value of Australian dollar versus the United States dollar between November 24, 2010 and December 1, 2010 and its impact on the A$45 million of purchase price resulted in an additional expense of $0.7 million within other income/(expense), net.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S4	In addition, a portion of the funds were transferred from the United States to Australia through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of A$105.0 million (or $100.6 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S5	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan, the Company entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S6	The Swap required the Company to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.125% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allowed the Company to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.48% based on a notional amount of $100.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S7	BBSW is the wholesale interbank reference rate within Australia, which the Company believes is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S8	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, the Company realized a net expense of $4.4 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S9	In addition, the Company recognized a net gain of $0.6 million within other income/(expense), net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S10	The Swap expired on December 1, 2012 and was settled for $9.1 million .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S11	On November 29, 2012, simultaneous with the termination of the existing swap, the Company entered into two new 2-year Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), effective December 3, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S12	These agreements expire on December 1, 2014.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S13	The Swaps effectively convert the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $109.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S14	The Swaps require the Company to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.25% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allow the Company to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.82% based on a notional amount of $109.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S15	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, the Company realized a net expense of $0.3 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P191_S16	In addition, the Company recognized a net loss of $0.3 million within other income/(expense), net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	In conjunction with the Company's announcement on July 23, 2012 of its plan to acquire RailAmerica, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P192_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to Carlyle a minimum of $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P192_S2	Each share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into approximately 17.1 shares of Class A common stock, subject to customary conversion adjustments.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P192_S3	The Series A-1 Preferred Stock was also convertible into the relevant number of shares of Class A common stock on the second anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P192_S4	Furthermore, the Company had the option to convert some or all of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock prior to the second anniversary of the date of issue of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded 130% of the conversion price (or $76.03 ) for 30 consecutive trading days, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P192_S5	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to the Company's stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P193_S0	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in the Company's consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P193_S1	As a result of the significant increase in the Company's share price between July 23, 2012 and the end of the third quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense to the Investment Agreement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P193_S2	The closing price of the Company's Class A common stock was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P193_S3	On February 13, 2013, the Company converted all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Class A common stock (see Note 24 , Subsequent Events ).

1012620_13_ITEM15_P200_S0	Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value:
1012620_13_ITEM15_P201_S0	Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P201_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company s derivative financial instruments consisted of interest rate swap agreements and cross-currency swap agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P201_S2	The Company estimated the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P201_S3	The Company estimated the fair value of its cross-currency swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including LIBOR implied forward interest rates, AUD BBSW implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P202_S0	Financial Instruments Carried at Historical Cost: Since the Company s long-term debt is not actively traded, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available to it for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P202_S1	The following table presents the Company s financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_13_ITEM15_P227_S1	The two lawsuits filed in the Florida Circuit Court alleged, among other things, that the RailAmerica directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their decision to sell RailAmerica to Genesee Wyoming via an allegedly flawed process and failed to obtain the best financial and other terms and that RailAmerica and Genesee Wyoming aided and abetted those alleged breaches of duty.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P227_S2	The complaints requested, among other relief, an order to enjoin consummation of the merger and attorneys' fees.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	On July 31, 2012, plaintiffs in the Florida actions filed a motion to consolidate the two Florida actions, appoint plaintiffs Langan and Sambuco as lead plaintiffs and appoint lead counsel in the proposed consolidated action.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P229_S1	The parties to the Delaware actions submitted orders of dismissal in November 2012, which the Delaware Court has granted.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P229_S2	On December 7, 2012, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company and the other parties to the Florida actions executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release to settle all related claims.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P229_S3	The settlement is not material and is subject to, among other things, final approval by the Florida Circuit Court.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P229_S4	On January 28, 2013, the Florida Circuit Court gave preliminary approval of the settlement and scheduled a hearing on final approval of the settlement for May 15, 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	In addition to the lawsuits set forth above, from time to time, the Company is a defendant in certain lawsuits resulting from the Company's operations in the ordinary course.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P235_S1	There are six input variables to the Black-Scholes model: stock price, strike price, volatility, term, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P235_S2	Both the stock price and strike price inputs are typically the closing stock price on the date of grant.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P236_S0	The assumption for expected future volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility of the Company s Class A common stock.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P236_S1	The expected term of options is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise data, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P236_S2	The expected risk-free rate is calculated using the United States Treasury yield curve over the expected term of the option.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P236_S3	The expected dividend yield is 0% for all periods presented, based upon the Company s historical practice of not paying cash dividends on its common stock.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P246_S0	On December 27, 2011, a train operated by the Company's subsidiary, GWA, derailed on the Edith River Bridge in Australia's Northern Territory (the Edith River Derailment).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P246_S1	Flood waters associated with heavy rainfall from Cyclone Grant washed away the southern portion of the Edith River Bridge while a northbound GWA intermodal train consisting of three locomotives, an unoccupied crew van and 33 wagons was passing over the bridge en route to Darwin.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P246_S2	The locomotives were damaged and the crew van and several intermodal containers and wagons containing copper concentrate were derailed into the river.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P246_S3	The railroad segment between Katherine and Darwin remained out of service for approximately 60 days.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P247_S0	The Edith River Bridge reopened on February 29, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P247_S1	The 60-day closure of the Edith River Bridge reduced the Company's revenues by approximately $7 million , primarily in the first quarter of 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P248_S0	In June 2012, the Company recorded a gain on insurance recoveries and a related insurance receivable of A$4.8 million (or $4.8 million at the average exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) for a business interruption claim.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P248_S1	The Company anticipates further business interruption insurance recovery related to the Edith River Derailment in 2013.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S0	In December 2011, the Company recorded a liability of A$15.0 million (or $15.3 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2011) for the estimated repair and related costs associated with the Edith River Derailment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S1	Since the Company believes substantially all of these costs will be recovered through insurance, the Company also recorded a receivable of A$14.0 million (or $14.3 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2011), with the difference representing the Company's insurance deductible.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S2	The Company increased its estimate of costs associated with the Edith River Derailment, as well as its estimate of insurance recovery, each by A$12.8 million (or $13.3 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S3	During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 , the Company made cash payments of A$26.3 million (or $27.3 million at the average exchange rate during the period) as a result of the derailment and received cash proceeds from insurance of A$22.1 million (or $20.9 million at the exchange rate on the date received).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company's outstanding insurance receivable associated with repair costs was A$4.7 million (or $4.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S5	The Company believes it is possible that additional claims related to the Edith River Derailment may arise and additional costs may be incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S6	The Company is unable to estimate the range of such claims based on currently available information.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P249_S7	However, the Company does not anticipate that these additional claims or costs, if any, will have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P250_S0	Segment Information The Company s various railroad lines are divided into 11 operating regions.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P250_S1	Since all of the regions have similar characteristics, they previously had been aggregated into one reportable segment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P251_S0	Beginning January 1, 2011, the Company decided to present its financial information as two reportable segments, North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P251_S1	The results of operations of the foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P251_S2	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar will impact our results of operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P252_S0	The Company acquired RailAmerica on October 1, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P252_S1	However, the shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the STB considered the Company's control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P252_S2	Accordingly, the Company accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and the Company's preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is included in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and included within the Company's North American European Operations segment.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P259_S1	The Company s Mexican operations described above and its remaining subsidiary, Servicios, are presented as discontinued operations and its results of operations are, therefore, excluded from continuing operations.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P259_S2	The net assets, results of operations and cash flows of Servicios were not material as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .

1012620_13_ITEM15_P260_S1	The Company utilized capital loss carryforwards, which were previously subject to a full valuation allowance, to offset the tax on this gain.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P261_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which requires entities to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P261_S1	It eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P261_S2	This guidance relates solely to the presentation of other comprehensive income and does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income, how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P261_S3	The Company adopted this ASU for the interim period ending March 31, 2012, which is the period for which it became effective for calendar year-end entities, and elected to utilize the two consecutive statements presentation.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P262_S1	This guidance is effective annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and the interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P262_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P263_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, which gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P263_S1	This guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P263_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P264_S3	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS: Series A-1 Preferred Stock Conversion On February 13, 2013, the Company converted all of the outstanding mandatorily convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P264_S4	As the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock exceeded $76.03 for 30 consecutive trading days as of February 12, 2013, the Company converted all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of the Company's Class A common stock on February 13, 2013.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P272_S0	RAILAMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P272_S1	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION RailAmerica, Inc. ( RailAmerica or the Company ) is a leading owner and operator of short line freight railroads in North America, operating a portfolio of 45 individual railroads with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P272_S2	The Company's principal operations consist of rail freight transportation and ancillary rail services.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P273_S0	On July 23, 2012, the Company and Genesee Wyoming Inc. (G W) jointly announced that they entered into an agreement under which G W would acquire 100% of the Company ("the Acquisition") for an all cash purchase price of $27.50 per share plus the assumption of the Company's outstanding term loan, revolving credit facility and share-based award liabilities (see Note 2).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P273_S1	On October 1, 2012, G W completed its previously announced acquisition of the Company.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P273_S2	Immediately following consummation of the acquisition, G W transferred the stock of the Company to a voting trustee to hold such shares of stock in an irrevocable independent voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered G W's application to control the Company's railroads.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P273_S3	Accordingly, G W accounted for the earnings of the Company using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and G W's initial allocation of the purchase price to RailAmerica's acquired assets and assumed liabilities was included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2012.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P273_S4	The STB approved G W's application to control the Company's railroads with an effective date of December 28, 2012, on which date the voting trust was dissolved.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P274_S0	In accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, full financial statements of significant equity investments are required to be presented in the annual report of the investor.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P274_S1	For purposes of S-X 3-09, the investee's separate annual financial statements should only include the period of the fiscal year in which it was accounted for by the equity method by the investor.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P274_S2	Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the period from October 1, 2012 (date of acquisition) to December 28, 2012, the period of equity accounting by the investor (the "period ).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P274_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RailAmerica, all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated subsidiaries in which RailAmerica has a controlling interest.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P274_S4	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U. S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P274_S5	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P275_S0	Noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity, in a subsidiary or consolidated entity, not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Company.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P275_S1	Such noncontrolling interests are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity, but separately from stockholder's equity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P275_S2	On the Consolidated Statement of Operations, all of the revenues and expenses from less-than-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries are reported in net income, including both the amounts attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interest.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P276_S0	MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P276_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of purchase price allocation, recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P276_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P277_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES While the global economy has recovered in recent years from the significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009 that included widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P277_S1	There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to the Company.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P277_S2	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact the Company's customers, suppliers and business in general.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P278_S0	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P278_S1	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P279_S0	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet consists of amounts held by the Company that are available for general corporate purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P279_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P279_S2	The Company maintains its cash in demand deposit accounts, which at times may exceed insurance limits.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P280_S0	Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information for the period follows (in thousands):
1012620_13_ITEM15_P281_S0	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P281_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded by management based upon the Company's analysis of accounts receivable aging and specific identification of customers in financial distress (e.g., bankruptcy or poor payment record).
1012620_13_ITEM15_P281_S2	Management reviews material past due balances on a monthly basis.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P281_S3	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P282_S0	MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Materials and supplies consist of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P282_S1	Materials and supplies are charged to operations using the average cost method.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P283_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P283_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P283_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purposes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P283_S3	Major renewals or improvements are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P284_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P285_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company's short line railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P285_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P285_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P285_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P286_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P286_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company's major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S1	When factors indicate that assets may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S4	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S5	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S6	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P287_S7	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events during the period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P288_S0	GOODWILL The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P288_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment review as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P288_S2	No impairment was recognized during the period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P288_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P289_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P290_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P290_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P290_S2	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company's assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P290_S3	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P291_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P292_S0	AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company is required to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P292_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as customer contracts and relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P292_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P293_S0	DERAILMENT AND PROPERTY DAMAGES, PERSONAL INJURIES AND THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS The Company maintains property and liability insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P293_S1	The Company's primary liability policies have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence as of December 28, 2012, and prior self-insured retentions have been as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P293_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P293_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company's liability policies.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P294_S0	Accruals for Federal Employment Liability Act (FELA) claims by the Company's railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P294_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P295_S0	The Company's property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P296_S0	INCOME TAXES The Company utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P296_S1	This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P296_S2	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P296_S3	Deferred tax assets are also established for the future tax benefits of loss and credit carryovers.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P297_S0	The asset and liability approach of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P298_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company's tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P298_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P299_S0	The financial statements and transactions of the Company's foreign operations are maintained in their local currency, which is their functional currency.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P299_S1	Where local currencies are used, assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P299_S2	Translation adjustments, which result from the process of translating the financial statements into U.S. dollars, are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment account, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P299_S3	Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for each period.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P299_S4	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P300_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balance by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.

1012620_13_ITEM15_P301_S1	This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and the interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1012620_13_ITEM15_P301_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Gallagher, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of Genesee Wyoming Inc., certify that (i) the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 , fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and (ii) the information contained in such report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of Genesee Wyoming Inc.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, we operate a longer-haul railroad that runs approximately 1,400 miles between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we operated in 39 states in the United States, four Australian states, one Australian territory and four Canadian provinces and provided rail service at 35 ports in North America, Australia and Europe.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , we operated over approximately 14,700 miles of owned, jointly owned or leased track (inclusive of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line operated under a concession agreement) and approximately 3,300 additional miles under other contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	GROWTH STRATEGY Since our initial public offering in 1996 through December 31, 2013 , our revenues increased at a compound annual growth rate of 19.3% , from $77.8 million in 1996 to $1.6 billion in 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Over the same period, our diluted earnings per common share (EPS) increased at a compound annual growth rate of 17.9% , from $0.29 (adjusted for stock splits) in 1996 to $4.79 in 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, which has two main drivers: (1) our operating strategy and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our railroads operate under strong local management teams, with centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2013, our operations were organized as 11 regions.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	In the United States, we have eight regions: Rail Link (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Pacific, Mountain West, Central, Southern, Midwest, Ohio Valley and Northeast.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	Outside the United States, we have three regions: Australia, Canada (which includes a contiguous railroad located in the United States) and Europe (which consists of operations in the Netherlands and Belgium).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S4	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge, customer service and safety culture that we view as critical to achieving our financial goals.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S5	Our regional managers continually focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P2_S6	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following four principal elements:
1012620_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	In 2013 , G W achieved a consolidated Federal Railroad Association (FRA) reportable injury frequency rate of 0.80 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 59% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	For comparative purposes, from January 2013 through November 2013 , the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average reportable injury frequency rate was 2.9 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 2.9 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	Based on these results, in 2013 , G W was more than three times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages, and also safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers and each of our local railroads are intently focused on exceeding customer expectations.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	This customer commitment results not only in traffic growth, but also customer loyalty and new business development opportunities.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Periodically, we engage a leading independent customer-satisfaction research firm to conduct a comprehensive customer satisfaction survey.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	The survey results are used to measure our performance and develop continuous improvement programs.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We generally build and operate each of our regions on a base of large customers and seek to grow rail traffic through intensive marketing efforts to new and existing customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) in 2012, we believe that our expanded North American footprint provides us with greater visibility to new commercial and industrial development opportunities in North America that should help increase the success of our marketing efforts.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also pursue additional sources of revenue by providing ancillary rail services such as railcar switching, repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enable shippers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	Separately, in Australia and Europe, where there are open access regimes, we are able to compete for new business opportunities with customers at most locations on the open access rail networks.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We focus on running cost effective railroad operations and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated prior to our acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead, consolidating equipment and track maintenance contracts, reducing transportation costs and selling surplus assets.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	At the same time, we seek to improve our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for our traffic type and density.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	In addition, because of the importance of certain of our customers and railroads to their regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	To assist our local management teams, we provide administrative, commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from centralized expertise.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S6	Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I relationship management.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S7	Our operations department assists with implementing our safety culture and training programs, leveraging our scale purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, ensuring efficient equipment utilization and service design, and providing mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S8	In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S9	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S10	Since 2000, we have acquired 92 railroads and made several significant rail equipment and track investments to serve customers that are developing natural resource projects, such as iron ore mines.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P9_S11	Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:
1012620_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Acquisitions of other regional railroads or short line railroads in the United States and Canada, such as our acquisitions of RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company (AZER) in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Acquisitions of international railroads, such as our acquisitions of FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia in 2010 and Rotterdam Rail Feeding (RRF) in the Netherlands in 2008.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Acquisitions or long-term leases of branch lines of Class I railroads, such as our proposed acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the Dakota Minnesota Eastern Railroad Corporation (DM E) from Canadian Pacific (CP), which includes 670 miles of CP's current operations between Tracy, Minnesota and Rapid City, South Dakota; north of Rapid City to Colony, Wyoming; south of Rapid City to Dakota Junction, Nebraska; and connecting branch lines as well as trackage from Dakota Junction to Crawford, Nebraska, currently leased to the Nebraska Northwestern Railroad (NNW), which acquisition was announced in January 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Acquisitions of rail lines of industrial companies, such as our acquisition of railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 2003.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	When we make acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and reduce costs wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead costs, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans, more efficient equipment utilization and enhanced customer service and marketing initiatives.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	For instance, with the acquisition of RailAmerica we eliminated duplicative corporate overhead costs and general administrative expenses during 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	We also believe that our footprint of railroads in North America will provide future opportunities to make contiguous short line acquisitions due to a higher number of touchpoints with other railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P13_S4	On a global basis, we believe that our scale and financial resources improve our ability to invest in rail opportunities worldwide.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P13_S5	We have played a significant role in the consolidation of the short line industry in North America and have made a number of important railroad investments in international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	According to the AAR, there are 574 freight railroads in the United States operating over 138,700 miles of track.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	As described in the table below, the STB classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on the amount of an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	The following table shows the breakdown of freight railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	(1) CSX Corp, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern Corp., Kansas City Southern Railway Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Class I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density, intercity traffic lanes.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	The primary function of the Regional and Local railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I networks.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Typically, short line (or local) railroads serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Short line railroads have more predictable and straightforward operations as they generally perform point-to-point, light density service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the large Class I railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Regional and short line railroad traffic is largely driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	For example, a Class I railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	Divestiture of branch lines spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry and enabled Class I carriers to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We operate one regional and 100 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 9,500 miles of track.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	According to Rail Trends 2013 , published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are 26,923 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We operate seven local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,200 miles of track.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Australia Australia has approximately 25,000 miles (approximately 40,000 kilometers) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers together and also connect key mining regions to ports.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, standard and narrow gauge.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,900 miles (approximately 4,700 kilometers) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles (approximately 2,200 kilometers) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054, unless canceled due to our failure to meet our commitments under the concession agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Australian rail freight industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	We are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland Australian states and in the Northern Territory.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	The rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use, and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Australia rail industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track they own or lease.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	Through our concession agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the primary tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	Our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Because Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition on their above-rail business from other rail carriers, as well as from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks for above rail business.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	The open access nature of the Australian rail freight industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P31_S2	However, shipments of bulk commodities in Australia are generally handled under long-term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take-or-pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator difficult.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for a substantial majority of the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,350 miles of track under its control on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	According to the trade association, Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are currently 16 rail operators that provide freight rail services in the Netherlands.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,225 miles of track under its control on the Belgian rail network and 12 rail operators certified for freight transport in Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	OPERATIONS As of December 31, 2013 , through our subsidiaries, we owned or leased 111 freight railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	Of these, 109 are short line railroads and one is a regional freight railroad with a total of approximately 13,300 miles of track in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	We also operated one longer-haul, 1,400 -mile railroad that links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia, pursuant to a concession agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P34_S3	Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over approximately 3,300 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	Freight Revenues We generate freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Freight revenues represented 75.0% , 71.4% and 70.3% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Non-Freight Revenues We generate non-freight revenues primarily from the following activities:
1012620_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Fuel sales to third-parties - revenues earned by Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) in South Australia from the sale of diesel fuel to other rail operators; GWA sold its third-party fuel operation in Cook, South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Non-freight revenues represented 25.0% , 28.6% and 29.7% of our total operating revenues in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	Railcar switching represented 41.3% , 54.0% and 52.1% of our total non-freight revenues in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P36_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , our operations served more than 2,000 customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P36_S4	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% , 31% and 29% of our operating revenues in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P36_S5	Three of our 10 largest customers in 2013 were located in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms generally ranging from less than one year to 10 years.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	These contracts generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion linked to our invested capital and the variable portion based on the volumes shipped.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , see the discussion under Part II Item 7.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	The intermodal commodity group consists of various commodities shipped in trailers or containers on flat cars.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	The coal and coke commodity group consists primarily of shipments of coal to power plants and industrial customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	The agricultural products commodity group consists primarily of wheat, barley, corn and other grains as well as soybean meal.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	The pulp and paper commodity group consists primarily of outbound shipments of container board and finished papers and inbound shipments of wood pulp.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	The metallic ores commodity group consists primarily of manganese ore, iron ore, copper concentrate and ore, alumina and nickel ore.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	The metals commodity group consists primarily of finished steel products such as coils, pipe, slabs and ingots as well as scrap metal and pig iron.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	The minerals and stone commodity group consists primarily of cement, gypsum, salt used in highway ice control, sand used in fracking oil and gas wells, roofing granules, clay and limestone.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The chemicals and plastics commodity group consists primarily of sulfuric acid and other chemicals used in manufacturing, particularly in the paper industry.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	The lumber and forest products commodity group consists primarily of export logs, finished lumber, wood pellets and wood chips used in paper manufacturing.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	The petroleum products commodity group consists primarily of liquefied petroleum gas, crude oil, asphalt and diesel fuel.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	The food or kindred products commodity group consists primarily of canned fruits and vegetables.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S5	The waste commodity group consists primarily of municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S6	The autos and auto parts commodity group consists primarily of finished automobiles and stamped auto parts.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S7	The other commodity group consists of all freight not included in the commodity groups set forth above.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P43_S8	Segment and Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our segment and geographic areas, see Note 18 , Segment and Geographical Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV Item 15.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Traffic Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized either as interline or local traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Interline traffic passes over the lines of two or more rail carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	It can originate or terminate with customers located along a rail line, or it can pass over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the traffic originating or terminating on the rail line (referred to as overhead traffic).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	Unlike overhead traffic, originating, terminating and local traffic in North America provides us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P46_S4	In 2013 , revenues generated from originating, terminating and/or local traffic in North America constituted approximately 94% of our North American freight revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	In Australia, the distinction between interline or local traffic is less relevant, as the open access regime in Australia permits all participants in the above rail industry to compete for new and existing traffic and for new business development opportunities.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Seasonality of Operations Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or its demand cycle.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	For instance, certain agricultural and food products, such as winter wheat in Canada, ship only during certain months each year.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations as a result of weather patterns.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	See Note 19 , Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited) , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	In addition, due to adverse winter conditions, we may also experience reduced shipments as a result of weather-related network disruptions and also tend to incur higher operating costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season ( e.g., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2013 , our railroads and railcar switching locations had approximately 4,800 full time employees.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Of this total, approximately 1,800 employees were union members.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our railroads have 76 contracts with unions.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 18 of those agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 68 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P53_S4	In the Netherlands, RRF is not party to any collective bargaining agreements, but it is party to a collective bargaining agreement in Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Railway Labor Act (RLA) governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the United States.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	The RLA establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Canada Labour Code and the relevant provincial labor laws govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Canada.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	The Federal Fair Work Act governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	The RLA and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	We believe we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	In order to continuously improve our safety results, we also focus on additional safety metrics, such as human factor incidents, that are instrumental in reducing our FRA reportable injuries.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	G W's consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate, as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, was 0.80 for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S4	On a pro forma basis, G W's FRA reportable injury frequency rate combined with RailAmerica was 1.13 for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S5	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads in the rail industry was 2.9 in 2013 (through November) and 3.2 in 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S6	Our employees also strive to heighten awareness of rail safety in the communities where we operate through participation in governmental and industry sponsored safety programs, like Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit organization that provides public education programs to prevent collisions, injuries and fatalities on and around railroad tracks and highway-rail grade crossings.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S7	During 2013, employees of our railroads made more than 200 Operation Lifesaver presentations focused on the dangers associated with highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad property.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S8	We also participate in safety committees of the AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S9	We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S10	On August 1, 2013, we renewed these annual insurance policies, which now cover all of our operations under one insurance program.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P57_S11	Incidents involving entities previously owned by RailAmerica that occurred prior to this renewal would be considered under RailAmerica s legacy liability and property insurance policies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	RailAmerica's prior primary liability policies self-insured retentions were as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	The liability policies cover third-party claims and damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S4	Our property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $1.0 million per occurrence except in Australia where our self-insurance retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S5	RailAmerica's primary property damage policies previously had self-insured retentions up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S6	The property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P58_S7	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Employees of our United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under our liability policies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Employees of our industrial switching and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers compensation policies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	Employees of our Canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers compensation policy.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	Employees of our Australian operations are covered by the respective state-based workers compensation legislation in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P59_S5	Employees of our European operations are covered by the workers compensation legislation of the Netherlands and Belgium, as applicable.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	COMPETITION The unique and difficult to replicate infrastructure associated with railroads is a key benefit of the industry as compared to other modes of transportation, such as trucking (which uses public highways, toll roads, etc.) and shipping (which uses river systems and ports).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	However, railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes, ships, barges and pipelines.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	In North America, a railroad typically is the only rail carrier directly serving a customer on its line, which is a key differentiating factor versus trucking and shipping.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	Most freight is interchanged between railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	In Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	To a lesser degree, we also face competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments in projects, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including infrastructure and private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and long-term operator of rail properties, our managerial and financial resources, as well as our commitment to safety and the communities in which we operate, positions us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	REGULATION United States In addition to environmental laws, securities laws, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	The FRA, DOT, OSHA and PHMSA have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, which includes the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and railcar inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	In 2013, the STB continued various proceedings on whether to expand rail regulation.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	The STB continues to evaluate the impact of access regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	During the past several legislative sessions, bills have been introduced in Congress that would expand the regulatory authority of the STB and could include new antitrust provisions that alter the regulatory structure of the railroad industry.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Additionally, a two-year DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits, which commenced in 2012, could result in subsequent federal legislation.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, we continue to monitor these proposed bills.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	In 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the installation of positive train control (PTC) by the end of 2015.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	Although still under development, PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	Certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC or PTC-related equipment by the end of 2015.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P72_S3	We do not expect that our compliance with the final rules governing the installation of PTC will give rise to any material financial expenditures.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Canada St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec) and Ottawa Valley Railway are federally regulated railroads that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canada Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	In addition, Huron Central Railway, Goderich-Exeter Railway and Southern Ontario Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	Provincially regulated railways operate only within one province and hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by a provincial authority.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	In the Province of Quebec, the Fitness Certificate is delivered by the Minist re des Transports du Quebec, while in Ontario, under the Shortline Railways Act, 1995, a license must be obtained from the Registrar of Shortline Railways.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated, as are railway services.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada s Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Australia In Australia, regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our Australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	Regulation of track access is governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	The state access regimes are required to be certified by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P77_S4	As a result, with respect to rail infrastructure access, our Australian subsidiaries are subject to the state-based access regimes.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P77_S5	In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	In the European Union (EU), several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	These directives generally cover the development of railways, allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	The EU legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network and EU Member States must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P79_S2	These directives have been implemented in Dutch railway legislation such as the Railways Act and in Belgian railway legislation such as the Law on Railway Safety.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment; the Living Environment and Transport Inspectorate; the Dutch railways infrastructure manager, ProRail; and Keyrail (the Dutch railways infrastructure manager for the Betuweroute, a dedicated freight railway connecting the Port of Rotterdam to the German border and within the Port of Rotterdam).
1012620_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	All railways in the Netherlands must have a license and a safety certificate issued by the regulator, the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate, part of the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	A rail operator must also have a license from ProRail and/or Keyrail, the Dutch rail infrastructure authorities, to use the rail infrastructure.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Dutch Competition Authority is charged with the supervision of compliance with the European Community's directives on the development of the railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations, which is currently hosted by FPS Mobility and Transport, and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	Rail service providers based in Belgium must obtain a rail operator license from the Federal Minister for Mobility and Transport.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	Rail service providers that wish to operate in Belgium must obtain a safety certificate, which is comprised of Parts A and B. Part A must be obtained from the Railway Safety and Interoperability Service (SSICF) if the rail service provider is based in Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P82_S3	Part B must be obtained from SSICF regardless of where the rail service provider is based.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	In Belgium, the Belgium Competition Authority is responsible for promoting and safeguarding active competition in Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	Both the Dutch Competition Authority and the Belgium Competition Authority work together with other competition authorities and are part of the European Competition Network, the European Competition Authorities and the International Competition Network .
1012620_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions, and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	In Australia, these functions are administered primarily by the Department of Transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	In the Netherlands, European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	European, national and local environmental policies are administered by the FPS Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment in Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	The Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our Australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	Consequently, the Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	We estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures.
1012620_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Slower growth, an economic recession, or significant changes in commodity prices or regulation that affects the countries where we operate or their imports and exports, could negatively impact our business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For instance, in Australia, a portion of the commodities we transport are supporting economic growth and industrial development in Asian countries, particularly China.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	A sustained slowdown in such countries could impact us.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Slower growth in China, and the resulting impact on demand for, and lower prices of, natural resources could be a factor influencing decisions to delay and cancel certain mining projects in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, we anticipate benefiting from development of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from shale regions in the United States, but low natural gas prices or additional regulations impacting the energy sector could reduce such development and the benefit we could realize.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	In addition, we are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P0_S8	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from economic activity and industrialization could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our results of operations and rail infrastructure are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the United States or Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States or Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment or other substantial disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations, it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States, which lessen demand for coal.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues generated by our Australian operations are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the South Australian grain harvest and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the Northern Territory.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by such weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the United States and Canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Such weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our growth strategy is based in part on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past, partially due to the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Integrating acquired businesses, including our pending acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the DM E, could also result in significant unexpected costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Further, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We may be unable to realize these savings or other benefits in the time frame that we expect or at all.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements, including renewals of leases with Class I railroads, operating costs, competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	There is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that the Company will not discover unanticipated liabilities.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Further, while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Also, the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	For example, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S10	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P9_S11	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P12_S9	If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our operations served more than 2,000 customers in 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our operating revenues in 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Three of our 10 largest customers in 2013 were located in Australia and accounted for approximately 10.1% of our operating revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In 2013 , our largest customer was a company in the metallic ores industry and represented approximately 5.9% of our operating revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Under these contracts, freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	A number of our customer contracts, predominately in Australia, contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the variable portion based on the volumes shipped.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Substantial reduction in business with, or loss of, important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In 2013 , approximately 85% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease or re-route certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements, freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We lease several railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under lease arrangements with varied expirations, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our 2013 total revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	For example, our revenues associated with leases from Class I railroads and other third parties subject to expiration in each of the next five years would represent approximately 1.2% , 1.5% , 0.0% , 1.8% and 1.6% of our operating revenues in each of those years, respectively, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	During 2013 , we obtained government funding for 28 new projects that were partially or completely funded by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 6% of our total capital expenditures during 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, competition for government funding from other short line railroads, Class I railroads and other companies is significant, and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects, incur additional debt or use additional cash.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of cost or risk.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil and toxic/poisonous inhalation hazard (TIH/PIH) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Additionally, United States laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	A rail accident or other incident or accident on our railroads, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	For instance, existing legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S10	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We have insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading, accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other incidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub-limits.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, on certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are operated over the same track as passenger trains.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For instance, in Oregon, our Portland Western Railroad operates certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon and our New England Central Railroad is also used by Amtrak for passenger service in New England.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Further, we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Derailments, collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Moreover, certain third-party freight and excursion train operators have contractual trackage rights to operate over certain of our rail lines.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	These third-party operators generally are required to maintain minimum levels of insurance coverage, but there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all of the losses arising from an incident involving such operators on our rail lines.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property casualties, as well as subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us, including such things as derailments, accidents, discharge of toxic or hazardous materials, or other like occurrences in the industry, may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims' expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In the United States, these agencies include the STB, DOT, FRA of the DOT, MSHA, OSHA, PHMSA, EPA, DHS and other federal and state agencies.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	New rules or regulations mandated by these agencies could increase our operating costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	For example, in 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which generally is to be completed by December 31, 2015.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	The FRA s rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements as they apply to Class II or Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting the PTC requirements to trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track, and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	However, certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC or PTC-related equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P23_S8	While we do not expect that our compliance with PTC requirements will give rise to any material financial expenditures, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In Australia, we are subject to both Commonwealth and state regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In Canada, we are subject to regulation by the CTA, TC and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, the Transport, Public Works and Water Management Inspectorate and the Dutch railways managers, ProRail and Keyrail.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations, which is currently hosted by FPS Mobility and Transport, and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Business Regulation for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	There are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the United States in recent years to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, various proceedings have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition, interchange commitments and competitive access.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	A two-year DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits also commenced in 2012, and could result in subsequent federal legislation.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, specific initiatives being considered by Congress and the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Significant legislative or regulatory activity could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our Senior Secured Syndicated Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement) contains numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and tests.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our failure to comply with the obligations in our Credit Agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the Credit Agreement or other debt agreements, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , we had a total indebtedness of $1.6 billion , and we had unused commitments of $406.0 million under our Credit Agreement (after giving effect to $3.1 million of undrawn letters of credit that reduces such availability).
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We expect to use a portion of the availability under our Credit Agreement to fund the pending acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the DM E.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Subject to the limits contained in the Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, the Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt and foreclosure on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	For interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Therefore, when we are the invoicing railroad we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and we are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S6	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular those in the mining and natural resources industry, before the customer commences operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S7	In those cases, we may be exposed to start-up risks that we would not be exposed to in respect of customers with active operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P32_S8	As a result, unexpected credit exposures or start-up delays could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Also, commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P35_S3	For example, natural gas can compete with coal we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S4	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S5	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P36_S6	For information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, see Additional Risks Associated with our Foreign Operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Changes in commodity prices could decrease demand for the commodities we transport, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Changes in the price of commodities that we transport could decrease demand for the transport of such commodities, which could reduce our revenues or have other adverse effects.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	For example, a decline in the price of corn that we transport may result in lower revenues for us if farmers decide to store such commodities until the prices for such commodities increase.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In such instances, we could experience reduced revenues and increased operating costs associated with the storage of locomotives, rail cars and other equipment, labor adjustments and other related activities, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Market and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our operating costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S5	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, as well as its physical impacts, could materially affect us.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S6	For example, federal, state and local laws, regulations, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives, equipment, vehicles and machinery or our rail yards.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, including the closure of coal-fired power plants we serve, climate change litigation and climate change itself could decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including, for example, coal mining operations, natural gas developers and producers, coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers and automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, such as by resulting in the closure of coal-fired power plants that we serve, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S10	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S11	Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change including claims alleging impact of our operations on climate change.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P37_S12	Any such market or regulatory responses or litigation, as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming, such as floods, rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and intense storms, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned or operated by us.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Under some environmental statutes, such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several, whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	While we maintain insurance for certain environmental damages and claims, environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs and expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination that may or may not be covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	For instance, we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the floating interest rate payments under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	While these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In 2013 , we consumed 43.5 million gallons of diesel fuel.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S4	However, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease and could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 12% and 13% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P43_S6	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability against us that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	We are a party to 76 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S5	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 18 of those agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Approximately 1,800 of our approximately 4,800 full time employees are union members.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P45_S7	We have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional 68 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If such Class I railroads were to have a work stoppage or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S6	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, or attract and retain senior leadership, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S7	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S8	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S9	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S10	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 16% of our current workforce will become eligible for retirement.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S11	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S12	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S13	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S14	In addition, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S15	Finally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S16	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S17	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S18	Further, the loss of any executive officers or key employees could require the remaining senior leadership to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P46_S19	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership, and the inability to find a suitable replacement, could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as railcars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain railcars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	For example, in the event of additional government regulations affecting tank cars, there is no guarantee that a sufficient number of tank cars will be available to support the demand for transport of petroleum products in North America.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As of January 1, 2014 , according to the AAR, approximately 18% of the North American railcar fleet was in storage.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In some cases we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	For example, in Australia the availability of new locomotives is limited, with long lead times for delivery.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Some of our subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Because some of our subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe accounted for 21% , 9% , and 1% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be canceled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	If our concession or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider, but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Further, the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The Netherlands and Belgium also have open access regimes that permit third-party rail operators to compete for the business of RRF, our subsidiary in the Netherlands.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in Australia is a requirement under our concession deeds and some customer contracts.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Following significant derailments, the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Our ability to use RailAmerica's Section 45G tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation due to a change in the ownership of its stock.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P63_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , RailAmerica had tax benefits totaling approximately $106.9 million of Section 45G tax credit carryforwards.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change tax attribute carryforwards to offset its post-change income tax may be limited and may result in a partial or full write down of the related deferred tax assets.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	An ownership change is defined generally for these purposes as a greater than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period, taking into account shareholders that own 5% or more by value of our common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	While we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax attributes, our ability to use RailAmerica's net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future tax liabilities may be limited.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit expired on December 31, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate in 2014 will be higher if the credit is not extended.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of their tax year.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	On January 2, 2013, the Short Line Tax Credit (which had previously expired on December 31, 2011) was extended for 2012 and 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P67_S4	The most recent extension of the Short Line Tax Credit only extended the credit through December 31, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P67_S5	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, the loss of the credit will increase our tax rate and reduce our earnings per share.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If the earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries were required to be distributed, our effective tax rate could be higher.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P68_S3	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The amount of those earnings was $268.9 million as of December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Although it is our current intention to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of our controlled foreign subsidiaries, if the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, and could result in a higher effective tax rate for us, thereby reducing our earnings.

1012620_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of the shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	It is possible that we are a United States real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	If we are or become a United States real property holding corporation, so long as our Class A common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder (i.e., a holder that is not a United States citizen or resident, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and certain trusts and estates) who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more than 5% of our Class A common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 14,700 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire in the next few years and may not be extended.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that could expire in each of the next 10 years would represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	For additional information on these lease expirations see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also operate, through various trackage and operating rights agreements, over approximately 3,300 additional miles of track that are owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	The track miles listed below exclude approximately 1,750 miles of sidings and yards, which includes 1,520 miles in the United States, 160 miles in Canada and 70 miles in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	Track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium are also excluded.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	During 2013, we recorded mortgages on many of the owned properties described in the table below as additional security for our outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on our Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2013 , with respect to our railroads:

1012620_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Class B common stock is not publicly traded.
1012620_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Number of Holders On February 20, 2014 , there were 170 Class A common stock record holders and 18 Class B common stock record holders.
1012620_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividends We did not pay cash dividends to our Class A or Class B common stockholders in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future and intend to retain earnings, if any, for future operation and expansion of our business.
1012620_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	Any determination to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	In connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition in 2012, we sold $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with an effective 5% coupon (Preferred Stock) to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle).
1012620_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	We paid $2.1 million and $4.4 million of Preferred Stock dividends in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	On February 13, 2013, we converted all of the outstanding Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM5_P4_S3	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of our Class A common stock in a public offering.

1012620_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S1	On the conversion date, we also paid to Carlyle cash in lieu of fractional shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock totaling $2.1 million .
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	(2) On October 1, 2012, we acquired 100% of RailAmerica for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion , or $27.50 per share, plus the payoff of RailAmerica's debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S3	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S4	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S5	(4) On December 1, 2010, we acquired $320.0 million of net assets from FreightLink.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S6	In 2010, we incurred $28.2 million of acquisition-related expenses charged to earnings related to this transaction.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S7	In addition, we reversed $2.3 million of accrued restructuring expense related to our Huron Central Railway Inc. (HCRY).
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S8	In 2009, we acquired the 12.6% interest in Maryland Midland Railway, Inc. that we did not already own for $4.4 million.
1012620_14_ITEM6_P2_S9	In addition, with respect to HCRY, we recorded a non-cash write-down of non-current assets of $6.7 million and $2.3 million of restructuring expense, which were partially offset by a tax benefit of $3.6 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Outlook for 2014 Safety Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We have led the railroad industry in safety for the past five years and our goal for 2014 is an injury frequency ratio of 0.45 reportable injuries per 200,000 man hours.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	We expect growth in our revenues and income due to increases in traffic across most of our commodity groups.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	In particular, we anticipate growth in petroleum products traffic due to higher volumes of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas and the full year impact of an Australian iron ore project that ramped up during 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	We also expect growth in our income from the pending acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the DM E and from the full year impact of RailAmerica operating cost synergies that were partially realized in 2013 as the company was being integrated.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	We expect that this growth in our revenues and income will be partially offset by the negative currency translation impact of the weaker Canadian and Australian dollars on the results of our operations in those countries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	We expect our free cash flow in 2014 to increase primarily from an increase in cash from operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S7	We expect to make capital investments totaling $267 million in 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S8	Of this total, $168 million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital, $15 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in seven operating regions (Pacific, Northeast, Canada, Ohio Valley, Southern, Midwest and Rail Link) and $31 million is planned for specific 2014 projects, including certain track upgrades and locomotive lease buyouts.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P0_S9	In addition, we expect to spend $53 million on business development related capital, primarily the construction of a new rail spur in Canada and track improvements in Australia associated with a long-term contract extension.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	United States Short Line Tax Credit The United States Short Line Tax Credit, from which we have benefited since 2005, expired on December 31, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Without an extension to the tax credit, we expect our income tax rate to increase significantly in 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	While the Short Line Tax Credit has been extended on three separate occasions in the past with retroactive benefits, and there is significant bipartisan support for another extension in 2014, we are unable to predict the outcome of the United States legislative process.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	We continue to work on a number of potential projects located across the geographic markets in which we currently operate.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	For example, in Australia, we will continue to work on additional bulk minerals export projects.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	In the United States, with the expanded rail footprint provided by the RailAmerica acquisition, our industrial development is focused on the goal of adding new customers and/or facilities to our railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Specific areas of focus will be on shale oil and gas related projects, as well as, other growth sectors such as agriculture, natural resources and bio-energy.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Overview We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	In addition, we operate the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Our operations currently include 111 railroads organized into 11 regions, with approximately 14,700 miles of owned, jointly owned or leased track and approximately 3,300 additional miles under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	In addition, we provide rail service at 35 ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	On January 2, 2014 , we and Canadian Pacific (CP) jointly announced our entry into an agreement pursuant to which we will purchase the assets comprising the western end of CP's Dakota, Minnesota Eastern (DM E) rail line for a cash purchase price of approximately $210 million , subject to certain adjustments including the purchase of materials and supplies, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	We intend to fund the acquisition with borrowings under our existing Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	The acquisition is more fully described in Note 21 , Subsequent Events , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	The asset acquisition is expected to close by mid-2014, subject to approval of the STB and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	Upon closing, our new railroad will be named Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	We expect to hire approximately 180 employees to staff the new railroad and anticipate these employees will come primarily from those currently working on the rail line.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The western end encompasses approximately 670 miles of CP's current operations between Tracy, Minnesota and Rapid City, South Dakota; north of Rapid City to Colony, Wyoming; south of Rapid City to Dakota Junction, Nebraska; and connecting branch lines as well as trackage from Dakota Junction to Crawford, Nebraska, currently leased to the Nebraska Northwestern Railroad (NNW).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Customers on the line ship approximately 52,000 carloads annually of grain, bentonite clay, ethanol, fertilizer and other products.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The new rail operation will have the ability to interchange with CP, Union Pacific, BNSF and NNW.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	On October 1, 2012, we completed the acquisition of RailAmerica for $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of $1.4 billion plus net debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	The first quarter of 2013 was the first full reporting period in which we controlled the former RailAmerica railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	For additional information regarding RailAmerica, see Changes in Operations United States RailAmerica below.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Net income in the year ended December 31, 2013 was $272.1 million , compared with net income of $52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table below of $30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $77.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , net income in the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been $242.0 million , compared with net income of $129.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Included in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $41.0 million benefit associated with the retroactive extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2012 , which was signed into law on January 2, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	Excluding the $41.0 million retroactive benefit, our provision for income tax was $87.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which represented 27.4% of income before income taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	Included in our income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 was a $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with a contingent forward sale contract, which is a non-deductible expense for income tax purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	See Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details on the contingent forward sale contract.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S6	Excluding the $50.1 million mark-to-market expense, our provision for income tax was $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which represented 34.8% of income before taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S7	The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the renewal of the United States Short Line Tax Credit through December 31, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S8	The extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit produced book income tax benefits of $25.9 million (or $0.46 per share) and $41.0 million (or $0.72 per share) for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P8_S9	Since the extension became law in 2013, the 2012 impact was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	, 2013 were $4.79 with 56.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS attributable to our common stockholders of $1.02 with 51.3 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table below of $0.53 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2012 , adjusted diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $4.26 with 56.7 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.53 with 51.3 million weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table below of $0.53 as well as the $0.46 benefit from the United States Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2013, adjusted diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been $3.80 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	Our results in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included certain significant items that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Operating revenues increased $694.1 million , or 79.3% , to $1.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $874.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in our operating revenues included $635.2 million in revenues from new operations and a $58.9 million , or 6.7% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	When we discuss a change in existing operations or same railroad, we are referring to the period-over-period change associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of businesses acquired/initiated, such as those railroads acquired in the RailAmerica acquisition).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our traffic in the year ended December 31, 2013 was 1,886,012 carloads, an increase of 958,918 carloads, or 103.4% , compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The traffic increase included 909,768 carloads from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Existing operations increased 49,150 carloads, or 5.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	To provide comparative context for 2013 consolidated traffic volumes, we are providing a Combined Company comparison as though the RailAmerica railroads were owned by us during 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	In doing so, we have reclassified RailAmerica's 2012 information to conform with our presentation.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	On a Combined Company basis, traffic increased 117,301 carloads, or 6.6%, compared with traffic in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Carloads from existing operations increased by 103,174 carloads, or 5.8%, and new operations contributed 14,127 carloads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	The same railroad traffic increase was principally due to increases of 26,943 carloads of petroleum products traffic (primarily in the Pacific Region), 20,620 carloads of metallic ores traffic (primarily in the Australia Region), 16,209 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the Midwest Region), 7,534 carloads of lumber and forest products traffic (primarily in the Pacific and Northeast regions), 7,177 carloads of metals traffic (primarily in the Northeast and Southern regions), 6,960 carloads of intermodal traffic (primarily in the Australia and Canada regions) and 5,168 carloads of autos and auto parts traffic (primarily in the Ohio Valley and Pacific regions).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	All remaining traffic increased by a net 12,563 carloads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income from operations in the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $189.9 million , or 99.8% , to $380.2 million , compared with $190.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the previous table of $13.9 million and $20.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, adjusted income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $394.1 million , compared with adjusted income from operations of $211.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Our operating ratio was 75.8% in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with an operating ratio of 78.2% in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Excluding the impact of the significant items listed in the table above, our adjusted operating ratio was 74.9% in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with an adjusted operating ratio of 75.9% in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we generated $413.5 million in cash flows from operating activities.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	During the same period, we purchased $249.3 million of property and equipment, including $34.2 million for new business investments.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	These payments were partially offset by $33.9 million in cash received from government grants and other outside parties for capital spending and $6.7 million in proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S7	We also repaid $209.3 million of outstanding debt.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S8	Changes in Operations United States RailAmerica, Inc.: On October 1, 2012 , we acquired 100% of RailAmerica's outstanding shares for cash at a price of $27.50 per share and, in connection with such acquisition, we repaid RailAmerica's term loan and revolving credit facility.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P15_S9	The calculation of the total consideration for the RailAmerica acquisition is presented below (in thousands, except per share amount):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	We financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's common stock, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of G W's and RailAmerica's outstanding debt prior to the acquisition as well as transaction and financing-related expenses with $1.9 billion of debt from a new five-year Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement) (see Note 9 , Long-Term Debt , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), $475.5 million of gross proceeds from the public offerings of our Class A common stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and $350.0 million through a private issuance of Preferred Stock to Carlyle.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	(See Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , and Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Commencing on October 1, 2012, the shares of RailAmerica were held in an independent voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our acquisition date fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in our consolidated balance sheets since December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	The results from RailAmerica's operations are included among the various line items in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and are included in our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a new accounting basis was established for RailAmerica on October 1, 2012 for its stand-alone financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Condensed consolidated financial information for RailAmerica as of and for the period ended December 28, 2012 is included in Note 8 , Equity Investment , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , as discussed more fully under Contingent Forward Sale Contract in Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition (the Investment Agreement).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The expense resulted from the significant increase in G W's share price between July 23, 2012 (the date we entered into the Investment Agreement) and September 28, 2012 (the last trading date prior to issuing the Preferred Stock).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	We also incurred $17.0 million and $30.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	We recognized $15.6 million of net income from our equity investment in RailAmerica during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	The income from our equity investment included $3.5 million of after-tax acquisition/integration costs incurred by RailAmerica in the three months ended December 31, 2012.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Arizona Eastern Railway Company: On September 1, 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of AZER.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	We paid the seller $89.5 million in cash at closing, which included a reduction to the purchase price of $0.6 million based on the estimated working capital adjustment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Following the final working capital adjustment, we recorded an additional $0.8 million of purchase price in December 2011, which was paid to the seller in January 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	We incurred $0.6 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction through December 31, 2011, which were expensed as incurred.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The largest customer on AZER is Freeport-McMoRan Copper Gold Inc. (Freeport-McMoRan).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	AZER provides rail service to Freeport-McMoRan s largest North American copper mine and its North American smelter, hauling copper concentrate, copper anode, copper rod and sulfuric acid.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	In conjunction with the transaction, AZER and Freeport-McMoRan entered into a long-term operating agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Determination of Fair Value We accounted for the RailAmerica and AZER acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Under the acquisition method of accounting:
1012620_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The assets and liabilities of RailAmerica were recorded at their respective acquisition-date preliminary fair values by RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012, which is referred to as the application of push-down accounting, and were included in G W's consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date (see RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Upon approval by the STB for us to control RailAmerica, our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with our assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2012 (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Preliminary column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Between October 1, 2012 and December 28, 2012, we recognized income from our equity investment in RailAmerica of $15.6 million and other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million , primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	In addition, we recognized $21.8 million , representing the change in RailAmerica's cash and cash equivalents from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012, as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	In 2013, we finalized our determination of fair values of RailAmerica's assets and liabilities (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Final column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The measurement period adjustments to the fair values were as follows: 1) property and equipment increased $10.7 million , 2) intangible assets decreased $29.9 million , 3) deferred income tax liabilities, net decreased $16.0 million , 4) noncontrolling interest decreased $5.0 million , 5) all other assets, net increased $1.3 million and 6) goodwill decreased $3.1 million as an offset to the above-mentioned changes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	This resulted in additional annualized depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $4 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	We do not consider these adjustments material to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and as such, prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The assets and liabilities of AZER were recorded at their respective acquisition-date fair values and were consolidated with those of G W as of the September 1, 2011 acquisition date (see AZER column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of RailAmerica and AZER were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Australia Arrium Limited: In July 2012, our subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), announced that it had expanded two existing rail haulage contracts with Arrium Limited (formerly OneSteel) to transport additional export iron ore in South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	To support the increased shipments under the two contracts, during the year ended December 31, 2012, GWA invested A$52.1 million (or $54.1 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) to purchase narrow gauge locomotives and railcars as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility in order to support the increased shipments under the two contracts.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , GWA spent an additional A$22.3 million (or $19.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) on these projects and does not expect to invest any additional capital in these projects in 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Alice Springs and Cook: In May 2012, GWA entered into an agreement with Asciano Services Pty Ltd (AIO), a subsidiary of Asciano Pty Ltd, whereby GWA agreed to purchase an intermodal and freight terminal in Alice Springs, Northern Territory from AIO and GWA agreed to sell AIO certain assets in the township of Cook, South Australia that included GWA's third-party fuel-sales business.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	GWA completed the purchase of the Alice Springs intermodal and freight terminal in June 2012 for A$9.0 million (or $9.2 million at the exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) plus A$0.5 million (or $0.6 million at the exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) tax liability for stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Previously, GWA had leased the facility from AIO.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	The sale of the assets in Cook closed in September 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	We received A$4.0 million (or $4.1 million at the exchange rate on September 30, 2012) in pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale and recognized an after-tax book gain of A$1.3 million (or $1.3 million at the exchange rate on September 30, 2012).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Canada Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd.:
1012620_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	In August 2012, we announced that our newly formed subsidiary, KeRail Inc. (KeRail), entered into a long-term agreement with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd. (TSMC), for KeRail to provide rail transportation services to the direct shipping iron ore mine TSMC is developing near Schefferville, Quebec in the Labrador Trough (the Mine).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	In addition, KeRail plans to construct an approximately 21 -kilometer rail line that will connect the Mine to the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation (TSH) interchange point in Schefferville.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	Operated as part of our Canada Region, KeRail is expected to haul unit trains of iron ore from its rail connection with the Mine, which will then travel over three privately owned railways to the Port of Sept- les for export primarily to Tata Steel Limited's European operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	The agreement and construction are contingent on certain conditions being met, including the receipt of necessary governmental permits and approvals.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P34_S5	Once the track construction has commenced, the rail line is expected to be completed three to six months thereafter, weather conditions permitting.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Results from Operations When comparing our results from operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably warm or cool weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	In periods when these events occur, our results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products as well as product specific economic conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at customer plants (coal), winter weather (salt and coal) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P35_S4	As a result of these and other factors, our results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our results of operations in other reporting periods.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2012 Operating Revenues Overview Operating revenues were $1.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $874.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $694.1 million , or 79.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The $694.1 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $635.2 million in revenues from new operations and a $58.9 million , or 6.7% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	New operations are those that were not included in our consolidated financial results for a comparable period in the prior year.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	The $58.9 million increase in revenues from existing operations included an increase of $67.9 million in freight revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $9.0 million in non-freight revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table breaks down our operating revenues and total carloads into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table compares freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands, except average freight revenues per carload):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Total freight traffic increased 958,918 carloads, or 103.4% , in 2013 compared with 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Carloads from existing operations increased by 49,150 carloads, or 5.3% , and new operations contributed 909,768 carloads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The existing traffic increase was principally due to increases of 20,601 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 12,577 carloads of petroleum products traffic, 7,676 carloads of metals traffic, 6,958 carloads of intermodal traffic and 5,625 carloads of agricultural products traffic, partially offset by a 4,250 carload decrease in pulp and paper traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	All remaining traffic decreased by a net 37 carloads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Average freight revenues per carload decreased 7.4% to $624 in 2013 compared with 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 5.3% to $710 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	Changes in the commodity mix and fuel surcharges increased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 4.8% and 0.5%, respectively, partially offset by the depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, which decreased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 2.9%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Other than the impacts from these factors, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 2.9%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	Average freight revenues per carload were also positively impacted by the changes in the mix of customers within certain commodity groups, primarily metallic ores.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	The following table sets forth freight revenues by commodity group segregated into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in freight revenues from existing operations by commodity group.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	Changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates, fuel surcharges, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Agricultural products revenues decreased $1.5 million , or 2.5% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Agricultural products average freight revenues per carload decreased 8.0%, which decreased revenues by $4.7 million, while traffic volumes increased 5,625 carloads, or 5.8%, which increased revenues by $3.2 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	The decrease in average freight revenues per carload included a 3.9%, or $2.4 million, negative impact due to the depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	The carload increase was primarily due to increased export grain traffic in Australia, partially offset by lower volumes of Canadian winter wheat shipments.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	Because rates for Australian grain traffic have both a fixed and a variable component, the increase in Australian grain traffic resulted in lower average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Metallic ores revenues increased $44.1 million , or 58.7% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Metallic ores traffic volume increased 20,601 carloads, or 49.1%, which increased revenues by $39.3 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 6.4%, which increased revenues by $4.8 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The increase in volume and average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to a new iron ore contract in South Australia, which began in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	The increase in average freight revenues per carload included a 7.9%, or $5.2 million, negative impact due to the depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	Metals revenues increased $8.0 million , or 12.9% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	Metals traffic volume increased 7,676 carloads, or 8.1%, which increased revenues by $5.3 million, and average freight revenues per carload increased 4.4%, which increased revenues by $2.8 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S6	The carload increase was primarily due to increased shipments in the northeastern and southern United States.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S7	Pulp and paper revenues increased $3.4 million , or 5.2% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S8	Average freight revenues per carload increased 9.7%, which increased revenues by $6.5 million, while traffic volumes decreased 4,250 carloads, or 4.2%, which decreased revenues by $3.0 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S9	For the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of the RailAmerica acquisition, 6,494 carloads of pulp and paper traffic originating on a RailAmerica railroad that is contiguous to a legacy G W railroad were reported as new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S10	Otherwise, pulp and paper traffic volume increased 2,244 carloads, or 2.2%, and average freight revenues per carload increased 3.0%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S11	Minerals and stone revenues increased $2.7 million , or 5.7% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S12	Average freight revenues per carload increased 3.3%, which increased revenues by $1.6 million, and traffic volume increased 2,986 carloads, or 2.3%, which increased revenues by $1.1 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S13	The increase in volume was primarily related to increased rock salt shipments due to severe winter weather in the United States, partially offset by reduced traffic in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S14	Intermodal revenues increased $4.0 million , or 4.2% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S15	Intermodal traffic volume increased 6,958 carloads, or 10.4%, which increased revenues by $9.3 million, while average freight revenues per carload decreased 5.6%, which decreased revenues by $5.3 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S16	The carload increase was primarily due to new business converted to rail from road in Australia and new business in Canada.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S17	The decrease in average freight revenues per carload included a 7.3%, or $6.7 million, negative impact due to the depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S18	Petroleum products revenues increased $5.0 million , or 19.8% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S19	Petroleum products traffic volume increased 12,577 carloads, or 46.7%, which increased revenues by $9.7 million, while average freight revenues per carload decreased 18.4%, which decreased revenues by $4.6 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S20	The carload increase was primarily due to a new crude oil customer in the Pacific Northwest.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S21	The decrease in the average freight revenues per carload was due to customer mix.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S22	Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined increased by $2.0 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P43_S23	The following table compares non-freight revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following table sets forth non-freight revenues by new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Total non-freight revenues increased $141.5 million , or 56.6% , to $391.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $250.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase was attributable to $150.5 million from new operations, including construction revenues of $41.7 million from Atlas, a rail construction business acquired in the RailAmerica acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $9.0 million from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	The decrease in non-freight revenues from existing operations was principally due to a $11.5 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties as a result of the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012 and a $4.5 million decrease due to the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by higher railcar switching revenues of $6.5 million primarily due to new and expanded customer contracts in Australia and the United States.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Operating Expenses Overview Operating expenses were $1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $684.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $504.2 million , or 73.7% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	Labor and benefits increased $188.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily related to the addition of employees from the acquisition of RailAmerica and wage and benefit increases for existing employees.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S5	Of the remaining $316.0 million increase in operating expenses, $304.3 million was from new operations and $36.9 million was from existing operations, partially offset by a decrease in RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs of $13.0 million and a $12.3 million decrease due to the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S6	The increase in operating expenses from existing operations was driven primarily by lower net gain on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries, as well as increases in trackage rights expense, depreciation and amortization expense, other operating expenses and materials expense in the year ended December 31, 2013 , partially offset by a decrease in diesel fuel sold to third parties, primarily due to the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S7	Operating Ratio Our operating ratio, defined as total operating expenses divided by total operating revenues, was 75.8% in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with 78.2% in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S8	Income from operations in the year ended December 31, 2013 included $17.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a $4.7 million net gain on the sale of assets.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P45_S9	Income from operations in the year ended December 31, 2012 included $30.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by an $11.2 million net gain on sale of assets.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a material impact on our operating revenues and operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, the net impact of these foreign currency translation effects should not have a material impact on our operating ratio.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following table sets forth a comparison of our operating expenses in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Labor and benefits expense was $441.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $257.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $183.7 million , or 71.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase consisted of $176.8 million due to an increase in the average number of employees, $8.6 million due to annual wage increases and $2.9 million due to an increase in benefit expenses (primarily health care costs), partially offset by $4.6 million due to the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by approximately 2,060 over the prior year, primarily as a result of the RailAmerica acquisition.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase primarily resulted from the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads, as well as an increase in derailment expense and insurance premiums in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Materials expense, which primarily consists of the costs of materials purchased for use in repairing and maintaining our track property, locomotives, rail cars and other equipment as well as costs for general tools and supplies used in our business, was $78.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $25.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $53.0 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	The increase was attributable to $47.3 million from new operations, including $19.3 million from Atlas, and a $5.7 million increase from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	The increase from existing operations was due to increased track property and locomotive repairs in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S5	Trackage rights expense was $50.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $28.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $22.7 million , or 80.2% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S6	The increase was primarily attributable to $11.4 million from new operations, primarily driven by the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads, and an $11.3 million increase in existing operations, primarily due to new traffic from an iron ore customer in South Australia that moves over a segment of track owned by a third party.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S7	Net gain on sale of assets was $4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $11.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S8	Gain on insurance recoveries of $1.5 million and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, related primarily to a business interruption claim associated with the Edith River Derailment (described in Note 5 , Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S9	Other expenses were $78.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $44.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $34.2 million , or 76.9% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S10	The increase was primarily attributable to the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S11	RailAmerica acquisition-related costs of $0.4 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of acquisition and financing-related expenses from the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S12	RailAmerica integration costs of $16.7 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, consisted primarily of RailAmerica employee severance arrangements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S13	Other Income (Expense) Items Interest Income Interest income was $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $3.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .

1012620_14_ITEM7_P49_S15	The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher debt balance resulting from the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	In conjunction with our announcement on July 23, 2012 of our plan to acquire RailAmerica, we entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Carlyle agreed to purchase a minimum of $350.0 million of Preferred Stock, which Preferred Stock was convertible into our Class A common stock in certain circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The conversion price of the Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our closing price was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Preferred Stock, and, accordingly, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	On the conversion date, we also paid to Carlyle all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock of $2.1 million , as well as cash in lieu of fractional shares.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of our Class A common stock in a public offering.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Provision for Income Taxes Included in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $41.0 million benefit associated with the retroactive extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2012 , which was signed into law on January 2, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Excluding the $41.0 million retroactive benefit, our provision for income tax was $87.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which represented 27.4% of income before income taxes other than the retroactive benefit.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Included in our income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 was a $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with a contingent forward sale contract, which is a non-deductible expense for income tax purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S3	See Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details on the contingent forward sale contract.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S4	Excluding the $50.1 million mark-to-market expense, our provision for income tax was $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which represents 34.8% of income before taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S5	The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the renewal of the United States Short Line Tax Credit through December 31, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S6	The extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit produced book income tax benefits of $25.9 million and $41.0 million for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S7	Since the extension became law in 2013, the 2012 impact was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S8	Net income was $272.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with net income of $52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S9	Our net income in the year ended December 31, 2012 included the $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P53_S12	The following table sets forth the increase in our weighted average basic shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 as a result of our 2012 public offering of Class A common stock, the shares issuable upon settlement of the prepaid stock purchase contract component of the TEUs based on the market price of our Class A common stock at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and from the February 13, 2013 conversion of the Preferred Stock into our Class A common stock (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our various railroad lines are organized into 11 operating regions.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	All of the regions have similar economic and other characteristics; however, we present our financial information as two reportable segments North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following table sets forth our North American European Operations and Australian Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase in revenues from our North American European Operations consisted of a $505.1 million increase in freight revenues and a $152.8 million increase in non-freight revenues, in each case, primarily due to the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	Operating expenses from our North American European Operations were $959.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $470.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $489.2 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S3	In total, labor and benefits increased $177.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily related to the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads and wage and benefit increases for existing employees.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S4	The remaining $311.7 million increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads, including $17.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S5	Revenues from our Australian Operations were $325.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $289.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $36.1 million , or 12.5% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S6	The increase in revenues included a $47.4 million increase in freight revenues, partially offset by an $11.5 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S7	The $47.4 million increase in freight revenues consisted of $35.7 million due to a 32,452, or 15.9%, carload increase and an $11.8 million, or 5.6%, increase in average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S8	The increase in average freight revenues per carload and volume was primarily driven by the expansion of iron ore shipments and the resumption of traffic in 2013 that had been halted due to the Edith River Bridge outage in 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S9	The $11.5 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties was primarily due to the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S10	The depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in a $19.4 million decrease in revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S11	Operating expenses from our Australian Operations were $229.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $214.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $15.0 million , or 7.0% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S12	The increase in operating expenses included increased labor expense, trackage rights expense and additional expenses for fuel and for maintenance of property and equipment, primarily resulted from the expansion of iron ore shipments in South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S13	Operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 also included additional depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of new equipment and an increase in casualties and insurance expense due to an increase in derailment expense and higher insurance premiums, partially offset by an $11.0 million decrease in diesel fuel sold to third parties, primarily as a result of the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S14	Operating expenses included a gain on insurance recoveries of $1.5 million and $5.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily related to a business interruption claim associated with the 2011 Edith River Derailment (described in Note 5 , Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P56_S15	The depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in an $11.5 million decrease in operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2011 Operating Revenues Overview Operating revenues were $874.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $829.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $45.8 million , or 5.5% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The $45.8 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $22.7 million in revenues from new operations and a $23.1 million , or 2.8% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	New operations are those that were not included in our consolidated financial results for a comparable period in the prior year.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	The $23.1 million increase in revenues from existing operations included increases of $20.8 million in freight revenues and $2.3 million in non-freight revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	The following table breaks down our operating revenues and total carloads into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table compares freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands, except average freight revenues per carload):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Total freight traffic decreased by 69,954 carloads, or 7.0% , in 2012 compared with 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Carloads from existing operations decreased by 90,735 carloads, or 9.1% , and new operations contributed 20,781 carloads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	The existing traffic decrease was principally due to decreases of 79,886 carloads of coal and coke traffic, 20,618 carloads of agricultural products traffic and 10,890 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, partially offset by increases of 6,242 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 5,756 carloads of lumber and forest products traffic and 4,720 carloads of intermodal traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	All remaining traffic increased by a net 3,941 carloads.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	Average freight revenues per carload increased 15.2% to $674 in 2012 compared with 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S5	Average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 13.8% to $666 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S6	Changes in the commodity mix and higher fuel surcharges increased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 5.9% and 0.5%, respectively, partially offset by the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, which decreased average freight revenues per carload from existing operations by 0.2%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S7	Other than the impacts from these factors, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased by 7.6%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P59_S8	Average freight revenues per carload were also positively impacted by the changes in the mix of customers within certain commodity groups, primarily coal and coke traffic, metals traffic, waste traffic and other commodities.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table sets forth freight revenues by commodity group segregated into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following information discusses the significant changes in freight revenues by commodity group from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group can be impacted by changes in customer rates, fuel surcharges, net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Agricultural products revenues decreased $4.4 million , or 6.9% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	Agricultural products traffic volume decreased 20,618 carloads, or 17.7%, which decreased revenues by $12.7 million, while average revenues per carload increased 13.2%, which increased revenues by $8.3 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	The carload decrease was primarily due to a mechanical failure at an export grain terminal in Australia and a modal shift from rail to truck in the southern United States.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	Because rates for Australian grain traffic have both a fixed and a variable component, the decrease in Australian grain traffic resulted in higher average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P61_S6	Metallic ores revenues increased $14.8 million , or 26.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Effective January 1, 2012, a metallic ores customer in Australia switched its mode of transportation from using railcars to using containers.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	As a result, our metallic ores traffic count increased 6,048 carloads for an equivalent volume of product shipped.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	Otherwise, metallic ores traffic volume increased 194 carloads, or 0.6%, and average freight revenues per carload increased 25.6%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	The carload increase was primarily due to a new iron ore contract in Australia, partially offset by a decrease in traffic in Canada.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and an increase in long-haul iron ore shipments in Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S5	Metals revenues increased $6.8 million , or 13.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S6	Average freight revenues per carload increased 11.0%, which increased revenues by $5.7 million, and metals traffic volume increased 1,773 carloads, or 2.0%, which increased revenues by $1.1 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S7	The carload increase was primarily due to the expansion of a plant we serve in the southern United States.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P62_S8	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to a change in the mix of customer traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Coal and coke revenues decreased $12.6 million , or 15.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Coal and coke traffic volume decreased 79,886 carloads, or 32.2%, which decreased revenues by $33.0 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 24.8%, which increased revenues by $20.4 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	The decrease in traffic was largely driven by a decline in coal haulage traffic and customer-specific circumstances (such as temporary plant shut-downs, high inventory and a plant closing) as well as by warm winter weather, low natural gas prices and lower levels of export coal.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to the change in mix of customer traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S4	Minerals and stone revenues decreased $3.0 million , or 6.1% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S5	Minerals and stone traffic volume decreased 10,890 carloads, or 7.9%, which decreased revenues by $3.9 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 2.0%, which increased revenues by $0.9 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S6	The carload decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rock salt shipments due to high stockpiles as a result of mild 2011-2012 winter weather in the northeastern United States.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S7	Intermodal revenues increased $7.1 million , or 8.1% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S8	Intermodal traffic volume increased 4,720 carloads, or 7.6%, which increased revenues by $6.7 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S9	The carload increase was primarily due to increased traffic in Australia and a new customer in the southern United States.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S10	Lumber and forest products revenues increased $2.9 million , or 9.2% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S11	Lumber and forest products traffic volume increased 5,756 carloads, or 8.9%, which increased revenues by $2.8 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S12	The carload increase was primarily due to an increase in United States housing starts.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S13	Waste revenues increased $1.5 million , or 12.7% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S14	The increase was primarily due to an 11.5% increase in average freight revenues per carload, which increased revenues by $1.4 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S15	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to the change in mix of customer traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S16	Other freight revenues increased $1.7 million , or 30.6% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S17	The increase was primarily due to a 26.7% increase in average freight revenues per carload, which increased revenues by $1.4 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S18	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to the change in mix of customer traffic.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S19	Freight revenues from all remaining commodities combined increased by $5.9 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P63_S20	The following table compares non-freight revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following table sets forth non-freight revenues by new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Non-freight revenues increased $4.0 million , or 1.6% , to $250.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $246.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increase in non-freight revenues was attributable to $2.3 million from existing operations and $1.6 million from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	The increase in existing operations was principally due to higher railcar switching revenues of $5.9 million due to new and expanded customer service contracts in Australia and the United States, an increase in demurrage and storage revenues of $3.6 million due to an increase in the number of third-party railcars being stored in the United States and Canada, partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties due to the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012 and a $1.3 million decrease due to the net depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	Operating Expenses Overview Operating expenses were $684.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $637.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $47.3 million, or 7.4%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S4	The increase in operating expenses was attributable to $33.9 million from existing operations and $13.4 million from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S5	The increase in existing operations was primarily due to $18.6 million of acquisition-related expenses from the RailAmerica acquisition, $11.5 million of severance costs and expenses from the acceleration of stock-based compensation of RailAmerica employees and a $17.9 million increase in labor and benefits, partially offset by a $7.8 million decrease in equipment rents, a $5.6 million increase in net gain on sale of assets and a $4.7 million increase in gain on insurance recoveries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S6	In addition, the net depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar resulted in a $0.8 million decrease in operating expenses from existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S7	Operating Ratio Our operating ratio, defined as total operating expenses divided by total operating revenues, was 78.2% in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with 76.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P65_S8	Included in our operating ratio calculation for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $30.0 million of acquisition and integration-related costs associated with the acquisition of RailAmerica and severance costs and expenses from the acceleration of stock-based compensation of RailAmerica employees.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a material impact on our operating revenues and operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	However, the net impact of these foreign currency translation effects should not have a material impact on our operating ratio.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The following table sets forth a comparison of our operating expenses in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Labor and benefits expense was $257.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $236.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $21.5 million , or 9.1% , of which $17.5 million was from existing operations and $4.0 million was from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase from existing operations consisted of $8.2 million due to an increase in the average number of employees, $5.9 million from annual wage increases and $3.8 million of benefit increases (primarily health care costs), partially offset by $0.4 million due to the net depreciation of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	Our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 50 employees compared with our average number of employees during the year ended December 31, 2011 .

1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	The decrease was primarily due to the replacement of leased locomotives in Australia with new owned units and a decrease in freight car rents in the United States, which was partially offset by $1.3 million from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S5	Purchased services expense, which consists of the costs of services provided by outside contractors for repairs and maintenance of track property, locomotives, freight cars and other equipment as well as contract labor costs for crewing and drayage services, was $80.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $78.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $1.8 million , or 2.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S6	The increase was primarily related to increased use of contract services for repairs and maintenance of the locomotive and railcar fleets in Australia, partially offset by the decrease in expense related to the sale of our drayage business in 2011.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S7	Depreciation and amortization expense was $73.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $66.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $6.9 million , or 10.4% .

1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S10	The decrease was attributable to a $2.6 million decrease in existing operations, partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P68_S11	The decrease from existing operations was composed of $5.7 million due to a 6.3% decrease in diesel fuel consumption, primarily related to a 9.1% decrease in carloads, partially offset by $3.1 million from a 3.5% increase in average fuel cost per gallon.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The cost of diesel fuel sold to third parties was $11.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , a decrease of $5.7 million , or 33.3% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our third-party fuel-sales business South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	Net gain on sale of assets was $11.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S3	The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.3 million gain on sale of land and track in Canada and a $1.8 million gain on sale of certain assets in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S4	Gain on insurance recoveries in the year ended December 31, 2012 of $5.8 million was related primarily to a business interruption claim associated with the Edith River Derailment (described in Note 5 , Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S5	Gain on insurance recoveries in the year ended December 31, 2011 of $1.1 million related to a business interruption claim associated with Cyclone Carlos.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S7	The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in property tax expenses and $0.9 million from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S8	RailAmerica acquisition-related costs in the year ended December 31, 2012 of $18.6 million consisted of acquisition and financing-related expenses from the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S9	RailAmerica integration costs in the year ended December 31, 2012 of $11.5 million consisted primarily of severance costs and expenses from the acceleration of stock-based compensation of RailAmerica employees.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P69_S12	The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our Credit Agreement entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of RailAmerica, including a $12.6 million make-whole payment resulting from the redemption of pre-existing senior notes, the write-off of $0.5 million of debt issuance costs and higher outstanding debt due to the acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	In conjunction with our announcement on July 23, 2012 of our plan to acquire RailAmerica, we entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Carlyle agreed to purchase a minimum of $350.0 million of Preferred Stock, which Preferred Stock was convertible into our Class A common stock in certain circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The conversion price of the Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our closing price was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Preferred Stock, and, accordingly, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	See Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details on the contingent forward sale contract and Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for details regarding the conversion of the Preferred Stock.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract included in our income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2012 is a non-deductible expense for income tax purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	As a result, our provision for income tax was $46.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which represents 34.8% of income before income taxes other than the mark-to-market expense.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	Our effective income tax rate was 24.4% in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	The increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the expiration of the United States Short Line Tax Credit on December 31, 2011.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	On January 2, 2013, the United States Short Line Tax Credit was extended for 2012 and 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S5	The extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit produced book income tax benefits of $41.0 million for fiscal year 2012 and was recorded in the first quarter of 2013 when the extension became law.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S6	Net income was $52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with net income of $119.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S7	Our net income in the year ended December 31, 2012 included the $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with the contingent forward sale contract.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S9	Our diluted EPS in the year ended December 31, 2012 were $1.02 with 51.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS in the year ended December 31, 2011 of $2.79 with 42.8 million weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P72_S10	The weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2012 included 1,066,867 shares as a result of the public offering of Class A common stock and 850,773 shares as a result of the public offering of TEUs, which both took place in September of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our various railroad lines are organized into 11 operating regions.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	Since all of the regions have similar characteristics, they previously had been aggregated into one reportable segment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Beginning January 1, 2011, we decided to present our financial information as two reportable segments North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth our North American European Operations and Australian Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Revenues from our North American European Operations were $585.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $557.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $28.3 million, or 5.1%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	The $28.3 million increase in revenues from our North American European Operations included a $24.0 million increase in freight revenues and a $4.2 million increase in non-freight revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	The $24.0 million increase in freight revenues consisted of an increase of $2.9 million from existing operations and $21.1 million from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	Operating expenses from our North American European Operations were $470.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $428.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $42.5 million, or 9.9%.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	The $42.5 million increase in operating expenses from our North American European Operations included $29.1 million from existing operations and $13.4 million from new operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S5	The $29.1 million increase in operating expenses from existing operations was primarily due to an increase of $18.6 million of RailAmerica acquisition-related costs and $11.5 million of RailAmerica integration expenses, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease due to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar and the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S6	Revenues from our Australian Operations were $289.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $271.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $17.5 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S7	The increase in revenues included a $17.8 million increase in freight revenues and a $5.9 million increase in non-freight revenues, partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S8	The $17.8 million increase in freight revenues was primarily driven by a new iron ore contact in South Australia which began in October 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S9	The $5.9 million increase in non-freight revenues was primarily driven by an increased level of activity with existing customers.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S10	The $6.1 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties was primarily due to the sale of our third-party fuel-sales business in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S11	Operating expenses from our Australian Operations were $214.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with $209.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 , an increase of $4.7 million.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S12	The increase in operating expenses primarily resulted from the additional resources required to support a new iron ore contract in South Australia, including approximately 50 new employees and additional depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of new equipment, as well as an increase in other operating expenses primarily due to increased trackage rights and property tax expenses, partially offset by higher insurance recoveries in 2012 primarily related to a business interruption claim associated with the Edith River Derailment (described in Note 5 , Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and a decrease in equipment rents due to the replacement of leased locomotives with new owned units.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S13	Liquidity and Capital Resources We had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $62.9 million and $64.8 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S14	Based on current expectations, we believe our cash and other liquid assets, anticipated future cash flows, availability under our Credit Agreement, access to debt and equity capital markets and sources of available financing will be sufficient to fund expected operating, capital and debt service requirements and other financial commitments for the foreseeable future.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S15	During 2014, we expect to fund the pending acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the DM E with borrowings under our Credit Agreement.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S20	The $25.5 million change for 2013 was attributable to a $44.5 million increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S21	The 2013 period included $12.9 million in cash paid for expenses related to the integration of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S22	Of the $30.9 million change in working capital for 2012 , $30.1 million was due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which included $9.1 million associated with the settlement of a cross-currency swap that matured in December 2012 and $6.3 million in net cash payments related to the December 2011 Edith River derailment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S23	Of the $36.8 million change in working capital for 2011 , $25.6 million was due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $12.3 million was due to an increase in accounts receivable driven by an increase in business in 2011.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P75_S24	The $25.6 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses included $13.0 million associated with the payment of Australian stamp duty for the acquisition of FreightLink in Australia and $10.5 million due to the timing of the payment of Australian income taxes.

1012620_14_ITEM7_P81_S7	On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P81_S8	On the conversion date, we also paid to Carlyle all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock of $2.1 million , as well as cash in lieu of fractional shares.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P81_S9	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of our Class A common stock in a public offering.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P81_S10	In connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition described above, on September 19, 2012, we issued 2,300,000 5.00% TEUs.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P81_S11	Each TEU initially consisted of a prepaid stock purchase contract (Purchase Contract) and a senior amortizing note due October 1, 2015 (Amortizing Note) issued by us, which had an initial principal amount of $14.1023 per Amortizing Note.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P81_S12	As of December 31, 2013 , the Amortizing Notes had an aggregate principal amount of $21.9 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	On each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, we are required to pay holders of Amortizing Notes equal quarterly installments of $1.25 per Amortizing Note (except for the January 1, 2013 installment payment, which was $1.4167 per Amortizing Note), which cash payments in the aggregate will be equivalent to a 5.00% cash payment per year with respect to each $100 stated amount of the TEUs.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Each installment constitutes a payment of interest (at an annual rate of 4.50% ) and a partial repayment of principal on the Amortizing Note.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	The Amortizing Notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of October 1, 2015 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	If we elect to settle the Purchase Contracts early, holders of the Amortizing Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders' Amortizing Notes, except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the Amortizing Notes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	Unless settled or redeemed earlier, each Purchase Contract will automatically settle on October 1, 2015 (subject to postponement in certain limited circumstances) and we will deliver a number of shares of our Class A common stock based on the applicable market value of our Class A common stock, as defined in the Purchase Contract, which will be between 1.2355 shares and 1.5444 shares (subject to adjustment) per each $100 stated amount of the TEUs based on our share price at the time of settlement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Each TEU may be separated into its constituent Purchase Contract and Amortizing Note after the initial issuance date of the TEU, and the separate components may be combined to create a TEU.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Amortizing Note component of the TEU is recorded as debt and the Purchase Contract component of the TEU is recorded in equity as additional paid-in capital.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	On September 19, 2012, we recorded $197.6 million , the initial fair value of the Purchase Contracts, as additional paid-in capital, which was partially offset by $6.1 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	Our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the weighted average shares issuable upon settlement of the Purchase Contract component of the TEUs.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	For purposes of determining the number of shares included in the calculation, we used the market price of our Class A common stock at the period end date.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S5	At December 31, 2013 , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $62.9 million , of which $26.1 million was held in our foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S6	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S7	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S8	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S9	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries; however, the amount of the tax and credits is not practically determinable.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P83_S10	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 was $268.9 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Credit Agreement As of October 1, 2012, the Credit Agreement included a $425.0 million revolving credit facility, a $1.6 billion United States term loan, a C$24.6 million ( $25.0 million at the exchange rate on October 1, 2012) Canadian term loan and an A$202.9 million ( $210.0 million at the exchange rate on October 1, 2012) Australian term loan.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	The revolving credit facility also includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same-day notice, referred to as swingline loans.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of October 1, 2017 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings under the revolving credit facility in United States dollars, Euros, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	Under the revolving credit facility, the applicable borrowing spread for the United States base rate loans and Canadian base rate loans under the Credit Agreement initially were 1.50% over the base rate through December 31, 2012 and ranged from 0.50% to 1.75% over the base rate depending upon our total leverage ratio through March 27, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S5	The applicable borrowing spread in the case of the United States, Canadian and European loans is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Australian loans is the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW), which were initially 2.50% over the LIBOR and BBSW rate through December 31, 2012 and ranged from 1.50% to 2.75% over these rates depending upon our total leverage ratio through March 27, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P84_S6	BBSW is the wholesale interbank reference rate within Australia, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	On March 28, 2013, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment) to the Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	As a result of the Amendment, the applicable borrowing spread for the United States and Canadian base rate loans under the revolving credit facility were reduced to 0.25% to 1.50% over the base rate and the applicable borrowing spread for the United States, Canadian, European and Australian term loans were reduced to 1.25% to 2.50% over the respective LIBOR and BBSW rates depending upon our total leverage ratio.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The existing term loans and loans under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our United States subsidiaries for the United States guaranteed obligations and by substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries for the foreign guaranteed obligations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Credit Agreement is collateralized by a substantial portion of the real and personal property assets of our domestic subsidiaries that have guaranteed the United States obligations under the Credit Agreement and a substantial portion of the personal property assets of our foreign subsidiaries that have guaranteed the foreign obligations under the Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	During the three months ended December 31, 2012, we made prepayments on our United States term loan of $47.5 million , prepayments on our Canadian term loan of C$10.0 million (or $10.0 million at the exchange rate on the date it was paid) and prepayments on our Australian term loan of A$18.0 million (or $18.6 million at the exchange rate on the date it was paid).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	We also made scheduled quarterly principal payments of $16.4 million on our United States term loan, C$0.2 million (or $0.2 million at the average exchange rate during the period in which paid) on our Canadian term loan and A$2.0 million (or $2.1 million at the average exchange rate during the period in which paid) on our Australian term loan during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S6	In March 2013, we prepaid in full the remaining balance on our Canadian term loan, which resulted in the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.5 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S7	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013 , we made prepayments of $79.0 million and scheduled quarterly principal payments totaling $63.7 million on our United States term loan.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we made prepayments of A$24.0 million (or $23.6 million at the average exchange rates during the periods in which paid) and scheduled quarterly principal payments totaling A$8.1 million (or $7.7 million at the average exchange rates during the periods in which paid) on our Australian term loan.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S9	As of December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding term loans of $1.4 billion in the United States with an interest rate of 1.92% and A$150.8 million in Australia (or $134.4 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013) with an interest rate of 4.40% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S10	As of December 31, 2013 , we had outstanding revolving credit facilities of $11.0 million in the United States with an interest rate of 1.92% and 3.6 million in Europe (or $4.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) with an interest rate of 1.97% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S11	In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S12	The commitment fee rate initially was 0.50% per annum through December 31, 2012 and will range from 0.25% to 0.50% depending upon our total leverage ratio thereafter.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P85_S13	We also pay customary letter of credit and agency fees.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Credit Agreement also includes (a) a $45.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and (b) sub-limits for swingline loans including (i) up to $30.0 million under the United States revolving credit facility, (ii) up to $15.0 million under each of the Canadian revolving credit facility and the Australian revolving credit facility and (iii) up to $10.0 million under the Euro revolving credit facility.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	The Credit Agreement contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or prohibit our ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness; create liens; make investments; pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock; consolidate or merge or make acquisitions or dispose of assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in any business unrelated to the business currently conducted by us; sell or issue capital stock of any of our restricted subsidiaries; change our fiscal year; enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Under the Credit Agreement, we may not have an interest coverage ratio less than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	In addition, we may not exceed specified maximum total leverage ratios as described in the following table:
1012620_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with the covenants under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , our $425.0 million revolving credit facility consisted of $15.9 million of outstanding debt, subsidiary letters of credit guarantees of $3.1 million and $406.0 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Subject to maintaining compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement, the $406.0 million of unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2013 is available for working capital, capital expenditures, permitted investments, permitted acquisitions, refinancing existing indebtedness and general corporate purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	We expect to use a portion of the availability under our Credit Agreement to fund the pending acquisition of the assets comprising the western end of the DM E. On July 29, 2011 , we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (Prior Credit Agreement), which replaced our credit agreement then in effect.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	The Prior Credit Agreement had a borrowing capacity of $750.0 million and a maturity date of July 29, 2016 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	The Prior Credit Agreement included a $425.0 million revolving credit facility, a $200.0 million United States term loan, an A$92.2 million ( $100.0 million at the July 29, 2011 exchange rate) Australian term loan and a C $23.6 million ( $25.0 million at the July 29, 2011 exchange rate) Canadian term loan.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S5	As described above, in connection with the RailAmerica acquisition, on October 1, 2012, we repaid in full all outstanding loans, together with interest and all other amounts due under the Prior Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S6	No penalties were due in connection with such repayments.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P89_S7	In connection with the repayment of the Prior Credit Agreement, we wrote off $2.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and incurred $0.5 million of legal expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Senior Notes In 2005, we completed a private placement of $100.0 million of Series B senior notes and $25.0 million of Series C senior notes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The Series B senior notes bore interest at 5.36% and were due in July 2015 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	On October 1, 2012, we repaid the $100.0 million of outstanding Series B senior notes, along with an aggregate $12.6 million make-whole payment, with proceeds from the Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P90_S3	The Series C senior notes had a borrowing rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.70% and were repaid in July 2012 through borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P90_S4	In addition, we wrote off $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	TEUs As discussed above in RailAmerica Acquisition and Related Financing, each TEU consists of an Amortizing Note due October 1, 2015 , with an initial principal amount of $14.1023 per note.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Amortizing Notes had an aggregate principal amount of $21.9 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	On each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, we are required to pay holders of Amortizing Notes equal quarterly installments of $1.25 per Amortizing Note (except for the January 1, 2013 installment payment, which was $1.4167 per Amortizing Note), which cash payments in the aggregate will be equivalent to a 5.00% cash payment per year with respect to each $100 stated amount of the TEUs.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Each installment constitutes a payment of interest (at an annual rate of 4.50% ) and a partial repayment of principal on the Amortizing Note.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	The Amortizing Notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of October 1, 2015 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	If we elect to settle the Purchase Contracts early, holders of the Amortizing Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders' Amortizing Notes, except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the Amortizing Notes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	In 2010, as part of the acquisition of FreightLink, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A $1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A $50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the carrying value of the loan was A$2.3 million (or $2.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for railcars, locomotives and other equipment as well as real property.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	We also enter into agreements with other railroads and other third parties to operate over certain sections of their track and pay a per car fee to use the track or an annual lease payment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The costs associated with operating leases are expensed as incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	The number of railcars and locomotives leased by us, including 8,004 railcars and 175 locomotives acquired from RailAmerica in 2012, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was as follows:
1012620_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our operating lease expense for equipment and real property leases and expense for the use of other railroad and other third parties' track for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was as follows (2012 excludes lease expense related to RailAmerica's equipment and real property leases and trackage rights expense included in equity earnings for the period from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012) (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers and other third parties to operate over various rail lines in North America, with varied expirations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	Revenues from railroads we lease from Class I carriers and other third parties accounted for approximately 9% of our 2013 total revenues.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Shelf Registration We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires September 12, 2015), after which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three-year term.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and units.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties (e.g., customers) for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Insurance and Third-Party Claims Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims was $33.0 million and $25.0 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims at December 31, 2013 included $16.8 million from our Australian Operations and $14.8 million from our North American European Operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	The balance from our Australian Operations resulted predominately from a derailment in Australia s Northern Territory (the Edith River Derailment) in December 2011.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P99_S3	The balance from our North American European Operations resulted predominately from a derailment in Alabama (the Aliceville Derailment) in November 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P99_S4	We received proceeds from insurance totaling $11.1 million , $21.8 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and recorded related gains on insurance recoveries totaling $1.5 million , $5.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P99_S5	The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	Our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2014 include $47 million of capital expenditures for our Australian Operations, including $25 million in capital expenditures for new business development.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013 , there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	(3) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $0.8 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	(4) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures among our existing operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	Excludes the pending purchase of assets on the western end of CP's DM E line of approximately $210 million (which is subject to STB approval and the satisfaction of other closing conditions), which was announced in January 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	(5) Includes estimated casualty obligations of $11.4 million , deferred compensation of $11.2 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $8.8 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P102_S4	In addition, the table includes estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $6.9 million and our 2014 estimated contributions of $0.8 million to our pension plans.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2013 consisted of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses When comparing the effects on revenues of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2013 versus the year ended December 31, 2012 , foreign currency translation had an overall negative impact on our consolidated operating revenues due to the weakening of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	Currency effects related to operating revenues and expenses are presented within the discussion of these respective items included within this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P105_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Business Combinations We account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P107_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P108_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge s capacity to carry increased loads and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P109_S3	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P110_S1	As a result, we typically incur minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P110_S2	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P110_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P110_S4	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Estimated Useful Life (in Years) Property:
1012620_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P113_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P114_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P114_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P114_S4	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P115_S2	If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P115_S3	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year, and no impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P115_S4	Additionally, we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S4	On August 1, 2013, we renewed these annual insurance policies, which now cover all of our operations under one insurance program.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S5	Incidents involving entities previously owned by RailAmerica that occurred prior to this renewal would be considered under RailAmerica s legacy liability and property insurance policies.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S6	Our primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S7	RailAmerica's prior primary liability policies self-insured retentions were as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S8	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, our liability policy covers third-party claims and damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S9	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S10	Our property damage policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million per occurrence except in Australia where our self-insurance retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S11	RailAmerica's primary property damage policies previously had self-insured retentions of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S12	The property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P117_S13	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Employees of our United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P118_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under our liability policies.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P118_S2	Employees of our industrial switching and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers' compensation policies.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P118_S3	Accruals for FELA claims by our railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P118_S4	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awards to our employees under our Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P119_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P119_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P119_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P120_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , compensation cost from equity awards was $11.7 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	We also recorded an additional $5.1 million of costs from the acceleration of equity awards for certain terminated employees related to the integration of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $14.6 million , which will be recognized over the next 3 years with a weighted average period of 1.3 years.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S3	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards, including the benefit recognized from the acceleration of equity awards related to the integration of RailAmerica, was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.9 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S5	We also recorded an additional $4.1 million of costs from the acceleration of equity awards for certain terminated employees related to the integration of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S6	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards, including the benefit recognized from the acceleration of equity awards related to the integration of RailAmerica, was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S7	For the year ended December 31, 2011 , compensation cost from equity awards was $7.7 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P122_S8	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for equity awards was $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	In our consolidated balance sheets, these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	A deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards, is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, our deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P127_S1	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	Other Uncertainties Our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward-looking statements.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P128_S1	For a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject, and the consolidated financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented.
1012620_14_ITEM7_P129_S1	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 20 , Recently Issued Accounting Standards , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Risk Sensitivity Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	(1) Includes an A$50.0 million (or $44.6 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 assumed in the acquisition of FreightLink with a carrying value of A$2.3 million (or $2.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using United States LIBOR, Australia BBSW and Euro LIBOR (as of December 31, 2013 ).
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 1.75% for United States, Australian and European borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $2.8 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Furthermore, if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment, we believe we would incur interest rates no worse, and potentially better, than our current rates.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We apply the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value:
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Since our long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, the future interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	To value the interest rate swaps, a discounted cash flow model is utilized.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	On November 9, 2012, we entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	On the date of the hedge designation, September 30, 2016 , it is probable that we will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under our commercial banking lines.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The forward starting interest swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016 .
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P10_S3	We expect any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P10_S4	The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Our effectiveness testing during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings due to ineffectiveness.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P12_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , $4.1 million of net losses were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P12_S2	Based on our fair value assumptions as of December 31, 2013 , we expect to realize $1.6 million of net losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings within the next 12 months.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P12_S3	See Note 16 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information regarding our cash flow hedges.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , $142.1 million of third-party debt related to our foreign operations was denominated in the currencies in which our subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P13_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P13_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid from our foreign operations, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P13_S4	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from our United States operations to our foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business to the extent such acquisition is funded with United States dollars.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P13_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P14_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P15_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P15_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P16_S0	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to a non-functional currency intercompany loan between our United States and Australian entities, we entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P16_S1	As a result of the quarterly net settlement payments associated with this swap, we realized a net expense of $4.4 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P16_S2	In addition, we recognized $0.6 million within other income, net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P16_S3	The Swap expired on December 1, 2012 and was settled for $9.1 million .
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P17_S0	On November 29, 2012, simultaneous with the termination of the previous swap, we entered into two new 2-year Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), effective December 3, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P17_S1	These agreements expire on December 1, 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P17_S2	The Swaps effectively convert the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $109.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P17_S3	The Swaps require us to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.25% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allow us to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.82% based on a notional amount of $109.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P18_S0	BBSW is the wholesale interbank reference rate within Australia, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P18_S1	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, we realized a net expense of $2.7 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P18_S2	In addition, we recognized $0.4 million within other income, net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The following table summarizes the impact of these foreign currency financial instruments on our statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P20_S0	The following table presents our financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P21_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P21_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2013 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 12.4% of our total expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P21_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P21_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that partially offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_14_ITEM7A_P21_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $1.6 million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company s internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company s Audit Committee.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Genesee Wyoming Inc.:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P12_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P13_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	Unless the context otherwise requires, when used in these consolidated financial statements, the terms Genesee Wyoming, G W and the Company refer to Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries, including RailAmerica, Inc. and its subsidiaries (RailAmerica).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P19_S2	G W acquired RailAmerica on October 1, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P19_S3	However, the shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered the Company's control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P19_S4	Accordingly, the Company accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and the Company's determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities has been included in its consolidated balance sheets since December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P19_S5	All references to currency amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are in United States dollars unless specifically noted otherwise.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company owns and operates short line and regional railroads in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	In addition, the Company operates the 1,400 mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin with the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	Operations currently include 111 railroads organized into 11 regions, with approximately 14,700 miles of owned and leased track, approximately 4,800 employees and more than 2,000 customers.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	The Company provides rail service at 35 ports in North America, Australia and Europe and performs contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , for descriptions of the Company s changes in operations in recent years.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company's railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	Revenues from the Company s 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% , 31% and 29% of the Company s operating revenues in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P22_S2	The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P22_S3	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P22_S4	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company s tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies consist primarily of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Materials and supplies are removed from inventory using the average cost method.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	Business Combinations The Company accounts for businesses it acquires using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company records the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	As part of this process, the Company identifies and attributes values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P27_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P27_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P27_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business s acquisition date.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P28_S3	Major renewals or improvements, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company s short line and regional railroads are geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company depreciates its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P31_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company s major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Estimated Useful Life (in Years) Property:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	When factors indicate that an asset may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P33_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P33_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P34_S2	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset s carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P34_S3	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as long-term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Company performs its annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P36_S3	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012 .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P36_S4	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P36_S5	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets The Company performs an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P37_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims The Company maintains liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P37_S4	On August 1, 2013, the Company renewed these annual insurance policies, which now cover all of the Company's operations under one insurance program.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P37_S5	Incidents involving entities previously owned by RailAmerica that occurred prior to this renewal would be considered under RailAmerica s legacy liability and property insurance policies.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company s primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	RailAmerica's prior primary liability policies' self-insured retentions were as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers third-party claims and damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company s liability policies.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S4	The Company s property damage policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million per occurrence except in Australia where the Company's self-insurance retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S5	RailAmerica's primary property damage policies previously had self-insured retentions of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P38_S6	The property damage policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Employees of the Company's United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under the Company's liability policies.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Accruals for FELA claims by the Company's railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of its United States subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	Each of the Company s foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P41_S2	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to the Company s employees under the Company s Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan s purpose.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P45_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P45_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P45_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	The fair value of the Company's restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company s Class A common stock on the date of grant.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company s foreign subsidiaries were prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Currency translation adjustments are reflected within the equity section of the balance sheet and are included in other comprehensive income.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations upon substantial or complete liquidation of the underlying investment in the foreign subsidiary.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S3	Risks and Uncertainties Slower growth, an economic recession, or significant changes in commodity prices or regulation that affects the countries where the Company operates or their imports and exports, could negatively impact the Company's business.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S4	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S5	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P53_S6	Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation, most notably of which was the break out of trackage rights expense on the Company's consolidated statements of operations that had previously been included in other expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	CHANGES IN OPERATIONS: United States RailAmerica, Inc.: On October 1, 2012 , the Company acquired 100% of RailAmerica's outstanding shares for cash at a price of $27.50 per share, and in connection with such acquisition, the Company repaid RailAmerica's term loan and revolving credit facility.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	The calculation of the total consideration for the RailAmerica acquisition is presented below (in thousands, except per share amount):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's common stock, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of the Company's and RailAmerica's outstanding debt prior to the acquisition as well as transaction and financing-related expenses with approximately $1.9 billion of debt from a new five-year Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement) (see Note 9 , Long-Term Debt ), $475.5 million of gross proceeds from the Company's public offerings of Class A common stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share ) and $350.0 million through a private issuance of mandatorily convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , and Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments ).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Commencing on October 1, 2012, the shares of RailAmerica were held in an independent voting trust while the STB considered the Company's control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Accordingly, the Company accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and acquisition date fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets since December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P56_S2	The results from RailAmerica's operations are included among the various line items in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and are included in the Company's North American European Operations segment.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P57_S3	The expense resulted from the significant increase in the Company's share price between July 23, 2012 (the date the Company entered into the Investment Agreement) and September 28, 2012 (the last trading date prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P57_S4	On February 13, 2013, the Company exercised its option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of the Company's Class A common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P57_S5	The Company also incurred $17.0 million and $30.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P57_S6	The Company recognized $15.6 million of net income from the equity investment in RailAmerica during the three months ended December 31, 2012.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	AZER provides rail service to Freeport-McMoRan s largest North American copper mine and its North American smelter, hauling copper concentrate, copper anode, copper rod and sulfuric acid.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P64_S3	In conjunction with the transaction, AZER and Freeport-McMoRan entered into a long-term operating agreement.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Determination of Fair Value The Company accounted for the RailAmerica and AZER acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	Under the acquisition method of accounting:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The assets and liabilities of RailAmerica were recorded at their respective acquisition-date preliminary fair values by RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012, which is referred to as the application of push-down accounting, and were included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date (see RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Upon approval by the STB for the Company to control RailAmerica, the preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with the Company's assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2012 (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Preliminary column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	Between October 1, 2012 and December 28, 2012, the Company recognized income from its equity investment in RailAmerica of $15.6 million and other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million , primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	In addition, the Company recognized $21.8 million , representing the change in RailAmerica's cash and cash equivalents from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012, as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	In 2013, the Company finalized its determination of fair values of RailAmerica's assets and liabilities (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Final column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P69_S1	The measurement period adjustments to the fair values were as follows: 1) property and equipment increased $10.7 million , 2) intangible assets decreased $29.9 million , 3) deferred income tax liabilities, net decreased $16.0 million , 4) noncontrolling interest decreased $5.0 million , 5) all other assets, net increased $1.3 million and 6) goodwill decreased $3.1 million as an offset to the above-mentioned changes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P69_S2	This resulted in additional annualized depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $4 million .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	The Company does not consider these adjustments material to its consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and as such, prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	The assets and liabilities of AZER were recorded at their respective acquisition-date fair values and were consolidated with those of the Company as of the September 1, 2011 acquisition date (see AZER column in the following table).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	The fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of RailAmerica and AZER were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s unaudited pro forma operating results for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 as if the acquisition of RailAmerica had been consummated as of January 1, 2011.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	The pro forma operating results do not include the impact of any potential operating efficiencies, savings from expected synergies, costs to integrate the operations or costs necessary to achieve savings from expected synergies or the impact of derivative instruments that the Company has entered into or may enter into to mitigate interest rate or currency exchange rate risk (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The 2012 and 2011 unaudited pro forma operating results include the acquisition of RailAmerica adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the determination of fair values of the acquired property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to amendments to the Company s prior credit agreement and the elimination of RailAmerica's interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	The unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were based upon the Company s historical consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and RailAmerica's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the three months ended December 28, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	Since the pro forma financial results for 2012 and 2011 assume the acquisition of RailAmerica was consummated on January 1, 2011, the 2011 results included $20.3 million , net of tax, of acquisition-related costs and expenses related to change of control agreements incurred by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2012, $9.5 million , net of tax, of fees associated with the funding of the acquisition and $12.9 million , net of tax, of acquisition-related costs incurred by RailAmerica during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P72_S3	The pro forma results for 2012 included approximately $55 million of costs incurred by RailAmerica associated with the redemption of senior secured notes in January 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P72_S4	In addition, the 2012 pro-forma results have been revised to eliminate the Company's $50.1 million mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement in connection with the funding of the acquisition.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P72_S5	As a result of these charges, the numerator used in the calculation of pro forma diluted EPS attributable to G W common shareholders was reduced by the Series A-1 Preferred Stock dividend and the denominator excluded approximately 6.0 million if-converted shares related to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of the assumed dates and for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	In July 2012, the Company's subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), announced that it had expanded two existing rail haulage contracts with Arrium Limited (formerly OneSteel) to transport additional export iron ore in South Australia.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	To support the increased shipments under the two contracts, during the year ended December 31, 2012, GWA invested A$52.1 million (or $54.1 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) to purchase narrow gauge locomotives and railcars as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility in order to support the increased shipments under the two contracts.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , GWA spent an additional A$22.3 million (or $19.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) on these projects and does not expect to invest any additional capital in these projects in 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	Alice Springs and Cook: In May 2012, GWA entered into an agreement with Asciano Services Pty Ltd (AIO), a subsidiary of Asciano Pty Ltd, whereby GWA agreed to purchase an intermodal and freight terminal in Alice Springs, Northern Territory from AIO and GWA agreed to sell AIO certain assets in the township of Cook, South Australia that included GWA's third-party fuel-sales business.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	GWA completed the purchase of the Alice Springs intermodal and freight terminal in June 2012 for A$9.0 million (or $9.2 million at the exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) plus A$0.5 million (or $0.6 million at the exchange rate on June 30, 2012 ) tax liability for stamp duty (an Australian asset transfer tax).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P75_S2	Previously, GWA had leased the facility from AIO.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P75_S3	The sale of the assets in Cook closed in September of 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P75_S4	The Company received A$4.0 million (or $4.1 million at the exchange rate on September 30, 2012) in pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale and recognized an after-tax book gain of A$1.3 million (or $1.3 million at the exchange rate on September 30, 2012).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	Canada Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd.:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	In August 2012, the Company announced that its newly formed subsidiary, KeRail Inc. (KeRail), entered into a long-term agreement with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd. (TSMC), for KeRail to provide rail transportation services to the direct shipping iron ore mine TSMC is developing near Schefferville, Quebec in the Labrador Trough (the Mine).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	In addition, KeRail plans to construct an approximately 21 -kilometer rail line that will connect the Mine to the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation (TSH) interchange point in Schefferville.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P77_S2	Operated as part of the Company's Canada Region, KeRail is expected to haul unit trains of iron ore from its rail connection with the Mine, which will then travel over three privately owned railways to the Port of Sept- les for export primarily to Tata Steel Limited's European operations.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P77_S3	The agreement and construction are contingent on certain conditions being met, including the receipt of necessary governmental permits and approvals.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P77_S4	Once the track construction has commenced, the rail line is expected to be completed three to six months thereafter, weather permitting.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Results from Operations When comparing the Company s results from operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably warm or cool weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	In periods when these events occur, the Company's results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P78_S2	Finally, certain of the Company s railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products, as well as product specific economic conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P78_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as inventory levels maintained at customer plants (coal), winter weather (salt and coal) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Common shares issuable under unexercised stock options calculated under the treasury stock method, weighted average Class B common shares outstanding and Series A-1 Preferred Stock were the only reconciling items between the Company s basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	The total number of options used to calculate weighted average share equivalents for diluted earnings per common share as of December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , was as follows (in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The following total number of shares of Class A common stock issuable under the assumed exercises and lapse of stock-based awards computed based on the treasury stock method were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share, as the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	The following table sets forth the increase in the Company's weighted average basic shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 as a result of the Company's public offering of Class A common stock in September 2012, shares issuable upon settlement of the prepaid stock purchase contract component of the TEUs issued in September 2012 based on the market price of the Company's Class A common stock at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and from the conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into the Company's Class A common stock in February 2013:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of two classes of common stock designated as Class A common stock and Class B common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote and 10 votes per share, respectively.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the holder, subject to the provisions of the Class B Stockholders Agreement dated as of May 20, 1996.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	In addition, pursuant to the Class B Stockholders Agreement, certain transfers of the Class B common stock, including transfers to persons other than our executive officers, will result in automatic conversion of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P127_S4	In addition, the Company wrote off $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	TEUs On September 19, 2012, the Company issued 2,300,000 5.00% TEUs.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	Each TEU initially consisted of a prepaid stock purchase contract (Purchase Contract) and a senior amortizing note due October 1, 2015 (Amortizing Note) issued by the Company, which had an initial principal amount of $14.1023 per Amortizing Note.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P128_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the Amortizing Notes had an aggregate principal amount of $21.9 million .

1012620_14_ITEM15_P128_S4	Each installment constitutes a payment of interest (at an annual rate of 4.50% ) and a partial repayment of principal on the Amortizing Note.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P128_S5	The Amortizing Notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of October 1, 2015 .

1012620_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	In 2010, as part of the acquisition of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities (FreightLink Acquisition), the Company assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A$50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the carrying value of the loan was A$2.3 million (or $2.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P129_S2	The following is a summary of the maturities of long-term debt, including capital leases, as of December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	The Company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S2	The Company does not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone, nor does the Company use derivative instruments where it does not have underlying exposures.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S3	Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S4	The Company manages its hedging position and monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S5	Management believes its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the Company s best interest.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S6	However, the Company s use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P130_S7	The Company s instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a hedge of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P131_S1	The portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative used as a cash flow hedge that is offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in other comprehensive income.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P131_S2	As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P131_S3	The portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	At inception of the hedge and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P132_S2	When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the periods it no longer qualifies as a hedge.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P133_S1	For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P133_S2	The Company believes such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P133_S3	The gains or losses from the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P134_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P134_S2	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company s variable rate debt.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P134_S3	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of the Company's outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	On November 9, 2012, the Company entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P136_S1	On the date of the hedge designation, September 30, 2016 , it is probable that the Company will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under the Company's commercial banking lines.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P136_S2	The forward starting interest swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016 .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P136_S3	The Company expects any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P136_S4	The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company s effectiveness testing during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings due to ineffectiveness.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P138_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , $4.1 million of net losses were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P138_S2	Based on the Company's fair value assumptions as of December 31, 2013 , it expects to realize $1.6 million of net losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings within the next 12 months.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P138_S3	See Note 16 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedges.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , $142.1 million of third-party debt related to the Company s foreign operations was denominated in the currencies in which its subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P139_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those operations.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P139_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of the Company s debt service payments is limited.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P139_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid from the Company's foreign operations, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian or Canadian dollar or Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P139_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically from the Company s United States operations to its foreign subsidiaries, and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business to the extent such acquisition is funded with United States dollars.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P139_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P141_S1	Although these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P141_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to a non-functional currency intercompany loan between the United States and Australian entities, the Company entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	As a result of the quarterly net settlement payments associated with this swap, the Company realized a net expense of $4.4 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P142_S2	In addition, the Company recognized $0.6 million within other income, net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P142_S3	The Swap expired on December 1, 2012 and was settled for $9.1 million .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	On November 29, 2012, simultaneous with the termination of the previous swap, the Company entered into two new 2-year Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), effective December 3, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S1	These agreements expire on December 1, 2014.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S2	The Swaps effectively convert the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $109.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S3	The Swaps require the Company to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.25% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allow the Company to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.82% based on a notional amount of $109.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S4	BBSW is the wholesale interbank reference rate within Australia, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S5	As a result of these quarterly net settlement payments, the Company realized a net expense of $2.7 million within interest (expense)/income for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P143_S6	In addition, the Company recognized $0.4 million within other income, net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	In conjunction with the Company's announcement on July 23, 2012 of its plan to acquire RailAmerica, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P144_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Carlyle agreed to purchase a minimum of $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible into the Company's Class A common stock in certain circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P144_S2	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to the Company's stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition .
1012620_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in the Company's consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	The closing price of the Company's Class A common stock was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and, accordingly, the Company recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P145_S2	As discussed in Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , the Company converted the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Class A common stock on February 13, 2013.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements between the Company and the respective counterparty.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	The Company presents its derivative instruments on a gross basis.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P146_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the differences between the gross values and net values under such master netting arrangements were not significant.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P146_S3	The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	The following table shows the effect of the Company s derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	The following table shows the effect of the Company s derivative instruments not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in the consolidated statements of operations (dollars in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument held by the Company:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	Derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P151_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company s derivative financial instruments consisted of interest rate swap agreements and cross-currency swap agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P151_S2	The Company estimated the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P151_S3	The Company estimated the fair value of its cross-currency swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including LIBOR implied forward interest rates, AUD BBSW implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	Financial Instruments Carried at Historical Cost: Since the Company s long-term debt is not actively traded, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available to it for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P152_S1	The following table presents the Company s financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_14_ITEM15_P179_S1	The expected term of options is derived from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise data, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P179_S2	The expected risk-free rate is calculated using the United States Treasury yield curve over the expected term of the option.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P179_S3	The expected dividend yield is 0% for all periods presented, based upon the Company s historical practice of not paying cash dividends on its common stock.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	The Company uses historical data, as well as management s current expectations, to estimate forfeitures.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	RAILAMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P217_S1	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION RailAmerica, Inc. ( RailAmerica or the Company ) is a leading owner and operator of short line freight railroads in North America, operating a portfolio of 45 individual railroads with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P217_S2	The Company's principal operations consist of rail freight transportation and ancillary rail services.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	On July 23, 2012, the Company and Genesee Wyoming Inc. (G W) jointly announced that they entered into an agreement under which G W would acquire 100% of the Company ("the Acquisition") for an all cash purchase price of $27.50 per share plus the assumption of the Company's outstanding term loan, revolving credit facility and share-based award liabilities (see Note 2).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P218_S1	On October 1, 2012, G W completed its previously announced acquisition of the Company.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P218_S2	Immediately following consummation of the acquisition, G W transferred the stock of the Company to a voting trustee to hold such shares of stock in an irrevocable independent voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered G W's application to control the Company's railroads.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P218_S3	Accordingly, G W accounted for the earnings of the Company using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and G W's initial allocation of the purchase price to RailAmerica's acquired assets and assumed liabilities was included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2012.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P218_S4	The STB approved G W's application to control the Company's railroads with an effective date of December 28, 2012, on which date the voting trust was dissolved.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P219_S0	In accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, full financial statements of significant equity investments are required to be presented in the annual report of the investor.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P219_S1	For purposes of S-X 3-09, the investee's separate annual financial statements should only include the period of the fiscal year in which it was accounted for by the equity method by the investor.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P219_S2	Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the period from October 1, 2012 (date of acquisition) to December 28, 2012, the period of equity accounting by the investor (the "period ).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P219_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RailAmerica, all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated subsidiaries in which RailAmerica has a controlling interest.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P219_S4	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U. S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P219_S5	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P220_S0	Noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity, in a subsidiary or consolidated entity, not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Company.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P220_S1	Such noncontrolling interests are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity, but separately from stockholder's equity.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P220_S2	On the Consolidated Statement of Operations, all of the revenues and expenses from less-than-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries are reported in net income, including both the amounts attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interest.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P220_S3	The amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests (if any) are identified on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P221_S0	MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P221_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of purchase price allocation, recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P221_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P222_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES While the global economy has recovered in recent years from the significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009 that included widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P222_S1	There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to the Company.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P222_S2	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact the Company's customers, suppliers and business in general.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P223_S0	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P223_S1	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P224_S0	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet consists of amounts held by the Company that are available for general corporate purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P224_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P224_S2	The Company maintains its cash in demand deposit accounts, which at times may exceed insurance limits.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P225_S0	Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information for the period follows (in thousands):
1012620_14_ITEM15_P226_S0	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P226_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded by management based upon the Company's analysis of accounts receivable aging and specific identification of customers in financial distress (e.g., bankruptcy or poor payment record).
1012620_14_ITEM15_P226_S2	Management reviews material past due balances on a monthly basis.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P226_S3	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Materials and supplies consist of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P228_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P228_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purposes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P228_S3	Major renewals or improvements are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company's short line railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P230_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P230_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P230_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P231_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P231_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company's major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S1	When factors indicate that assets may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S4	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S5	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S6	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P232_S7	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events during the period.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	GOODWILL The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P233_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment review as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P233_S2	No impairment was recognized during the period.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P233_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P235_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P235_S2	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company's assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P235_S3	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company is required to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P237_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as customer contracts and relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P237_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P238_S0	DERAILMENT AND PROPERTY DAMAGES, PERSONAL INJURIES AND THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS The Company maintains property and liability insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P238_S1	The Company's primary liability policies have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence as of December 28, 2012, and prior self-insured retentions have been as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P238_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P238_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company's liability policies.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	INCOME TAXES The Company utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P241_S1	This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P241_S2	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P241_S3	Deferred tax assets are also established for the future tax benefits of loss and credit carryovers.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P242_S0	The asset and liability approach of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1012620_14_ITEM15_P243_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company's tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.

1012620_14_ITEM15_P244_S2	Translation adjustments, which result from the process of translating the financial statements into U.S. dollars, are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment account, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity.

1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	In addition, we operate a longer-haul railroad that runs approximately 1,400 miles between Tarcoola in South Australia and Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	We currently operate in 41 states in the United States, four Australian states, one Australian territory and four Canadian provinces and provide rail service at 37 ports in North America, Australia and Europe.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	We operate over approximately 15,600 miles of owned, jointly owned or leased track (inclusive of the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line operated under a concession agreement) and approximately 3,300 additional miles under other contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	GROWTH STRATEGY Since our initial public offering in 1996 through December 31, 2014 , our revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 17.4% , from $77.8 million in 1996 to $1.6 billion in 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	Over the same period, our diluted earnings per common share (EPS) increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15.6% , from $0.29 (adjusted for stock splits) in 1996 to $4.58 in 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1_P0_S6	We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, which has two main drivers: (1) our operating strategy and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our railroads operate under strong local management teams, with centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2014, our operations were organized as 11 regions.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	In the United States, we have eight regions: Central, Coastal (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Midwest, Mountain West, Northeast, Ohio Valley, Pacific and Southern.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	Outside the United States, we have three regions: Australia, Canada (which includes a contiguous railroad located in the United States) and Europe (which consists of operations in the Netherlands and Belgium).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge, customer service and safety culture that we view as critical to achieving our financial goals.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S5	Our regional managers continually focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P1_S6	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following five principal elements:
1012620_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	In 2014 , G W operations achieved a consolidated Federal Railroad Association (FRA) reportable injury frequency rate of 0.60 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 69% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	For comparative purposes, from January 2014 through November 2014 , the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average reportable injury frequency rate was 3.0 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 3.2 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	Based on these results, in 2014 , G W operations were more than five times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages and safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers and each of our local railroads is intently focused on exceeding customer expectations.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	This customer commitment results not only in traffic growth, but also customer loyalty and new business development opportunities.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	To ensure the needs of our customers are addressed promptly, we employ technology-based service exception tools to monitor service information, communicate issues and track corrective actions.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	Periodically, we engage a leading independent customer-satisfaction research firm to conduct a comprehensive customer satisfaction survey.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	The survey results are used to measure our performance and develop continuous improvement programs.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	We generally build and operate each of our regions based on the local customer base within our operating geographies and seek to grow rail traffic through intensive marketing efforts to new and existing customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) in 2012, we believe that our expanded North American footprint provides us with greater visibility to new commercial and industrial development opportunities in North America that should help increase the success of our marketing efforts.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	We also pursue additional sources of revenue by providing ancillary rail services such as railcar switching, repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enable shippers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P6_S3	Separately, in Australia and Europe, where there are open access regimes, we are able to compete for new business opportunities with customers at most locations on the open access rail networks.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	We focus on running cost effective railroad operations and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated prior to our acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead, consolidating equipment and track maintenance contracts, reducing transportation costs and selling surplus assets.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	At the same time, we seek to improve our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for our traffic type and density.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	In addition, because of the importance of certain of our customers and railroads to their regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S4	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S5	To assist our local management teams, we provide administrative, commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from centralized expertise.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S6	Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I railroad relationship management.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S7	Our operations department assists with implementing our safety culture and training programs, leveraging our scale in purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, ensuring efficient equipment utilization and service design, and providing mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S8	In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S9	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S10	Since 2000, we have added 98 railroads through execution of our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P8_S11	Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:
1012620_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Acquisitions of additional short line and regional railroads in the United States and Canada, such as our acquisitions of Pinsly Railroad Company's Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) in January 2015, RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company (AZER) in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Acquisitions of international railroads, such as our acquisitions of FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia in 2010 and Rotterdam Rail Feeding (RRF) in the Netherlands in 2008.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Acquisitions of rail lines from industrial companies, such as our acquisition of railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 2003.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	When we make acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and reduce costs wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead costs, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans, more efficient equipment utilization and enhanced customer service and marketing initiatives.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	In some cases, however, the best way to maximize the value of an investment is to increase expenditures at a new acquisition, such as for track upgrades, in order to improve customer service and drive additional revenue growth.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also believe that our footprint of railroads in North America provides opportunities to make contiguous short line railroad acquisitions due to a higher number of touchpoints with other railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	On a global basis, we believe that our scale and financial resources improve our ability to invest in rail opportunities worldwide.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P11_S5	We have made a number of important railroad investments in North America and in international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	According to the AAR, there are 574 freight railroads in the United States operating over 138,400 miles of track.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	As described in the table below, the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on the amount of an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	The following table shows the breakdown of freight railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	(1) CSX Corp, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern Corp., Kansas City Southern Railway Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density and intercity traffic lanes.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	The primary function of the regional and local railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I railroad networks.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	We refer to local railroads as short line railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Typically, local, or short line railroads, serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	Short line railroads generally have more predictable and straightforward operations as they largely perform point-to-point, light density service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the Class I railroads or larger regional railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	A significant portion of regional and short line railroad traffic is driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	For example, a Class I railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Divestiture of branch lines spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry and enabled Class I railroads to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	We operate two regional and 103 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 14,500 miles of track.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	According to Rail Trends 2014 , published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are 27,270 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	We operate eight local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,500 miles of track.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Australia Australia has approximately 25,000 miles (approximately 40,000 kilometers) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers together and also connect key mining regions to ports.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, standard and narrow gauge.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,900 miles (approximately 4,700 kilometers) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles (approximately 2,200 kilometers) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054, unless canceled due to our failure to meet our commitments under the concession agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Australian rail freight industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	We are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland Australian states and in the Northern Territory.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	The access rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use, and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Australian freight rail industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track they own or lease.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	Through our concession agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the primary tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P28_S3	Our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad despite the open access environment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Because Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under "open access" regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition on their above rail business from other rail carriers, as well as from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	The open access nature of the Australian freight rail industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	However, shipments of bulk commodities in Australia are generally handled under long-term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take-or-pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator difficult.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for a substantial majority of the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,350 miles of track under its control on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	According to the trade association Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are currently 19 rail operators that provide freight rail services in the Netherlands.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,225 miles of track under its control on the Belgian rail network and currently there are 13 rail operators certified for freight transport in Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	OPERATIONS Through our subsidiaries, we own or lease 116 freight railroads, including 103 short line railroads and two regional freight railroads located in the United States, eight short line railroads located in Canada, one railroad located in Australia and one railroad located in the Netherlands and Belgium, with a total of approximately 14,200 miles of track.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	We also operate one longer-haul, 1,400 -mile railroad that links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia, pursuant to a concession agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over approximately 3,300 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Freight Revenues We generate freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Freight revenues represented 76.4% , 75.1% and 71.4% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	Non-Freight Revenues We generate non-freight revenues primarily from the following activities:
1012620_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Other operating income - primarily revenues for providing crewing services and track access and management fees, the use of our real estate holdings, and for providing access to passenger operations, such as for Amtrak's use of the New England Central Railroad's track.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Non-freight revenues represented 23.6% , 24.9% and 28.6% of our total operating revenues in the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	Railcar switching represented 44.0% , 41.3% and 54.0% of our total non-freight revenues in the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , our operations served more than 2,000 customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% , 24% and 31% of our operating revenues in the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P34_S5	Two of our 10 largest customers in 2014 were located in Australia, one of which was in our metallic ores (iron ore) commodity segment and the other of which was in our agricultural products commodity segment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms generally ranging from less than one year to 10 years.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Generally, our freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	These contracts generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion based upon our invested capital and the variable portion based on the volumes shipped.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , see the discussion under "Part II Item 7.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The agricultural products commodity group consists primarily of wheat, barley, corn and other grains, as well as soybean meal.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	The chemicals and plastics commodity group consists primarily of sulfuric acid, ethanol and other chemicals used in manufacturing, particularly in the paper industry.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	The metals commodity group consists primarily of finished steel products and copper, as well as scrap metal and pig iron.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	The metallic ores commodity group consists primarily of manganese ore, iron ore, copper concentrate and ore, alumina and nickel ore.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S4	The coal and coke commodity group consists primarily of shipments of coal to power plants and industrial customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S5	The minerals and stone commodity group consists primarily of cement, gypsum, salt used in highway ice control, sand used in hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells, roofing granules, clay and limestone.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S6	The pulp and paper commodity group consists primarily of outbound shipments of container board and finished papers and inbound shipments of wood pulp.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S7	The intermodal commodity group consists of various commodities shipped in trailers or containers on flat cars.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S8	The lumber and forest products commodity group consists primarily of finished lumber, wood pellets, export logs and wood chips used in paper manufacturing.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S9	The petroleum products commodity group consists primarily of liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, asphalt and diesel fuel.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S10	The food and kindred products commodity group consists primarily of canned fruits and vegetables and food oils.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S11	The autos and auto parts commodity group consists primarily of finished automobiles and stamped auto parts.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S12	The waste commodity group consists primarily of municipal solid waste and construction and demolition debris.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P38_S13	The other commodity group consists of all freight not included in the commodity groups set forth above.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Segment and Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our segment and geographic areas, see Note 18 , Segment and Geographic Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Traffic Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized either as interline or local traffic.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Interline traffic passes over the lines of two or more rail carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	It can originate or terminate with customers located along a rail line, or it can pass over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the traffic originating or terminating on the rail line (referred to as overhead traffic).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	Unlike overhead traffic, originating, terminating and local traffic in North America provides us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P41_S4	In 2014 , revenues generated from originating, terminating and local traffic in North America constituted approximately 93% of our North American freight revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	In Australia, railroads generally serve from origin to destination with few, if any, interline movements.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Seasonality of Operations Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or its demand cycle.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	For instance, certain agricultural and food products, such as winter wheat in Canada, ship only during certain months each year.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations as a result of weather patterns.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	See Note 19 , Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited) , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	In addition, due to adverse winter conditions, we may also experience reduced shipments as a result of weather-related network disruptions and also tend to incur higher operating costs.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season (i.e., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we had approximately 5,200 full-time employees.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	Of this total, approximately 1,900 employees were union members.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our railroads have 76 labor agreements with unions.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 10 of those agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 72 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	In Australia, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	RRF is not party to any collective bargaining agreements in the Netherlands, but it is party to a collective bargaining agreement in Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Railway Labor Act (RLA) governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the United States.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	The RLA establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Canada Labour Code and the relevant provincial labor laws govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Canada.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	The Federal Fair Work Act governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	The RLA and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	We believe we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	In order to continuously improve our safety results, we utilize various safety metrics, such as human factor incidents, that are instrumental in reducing our FRA reportable injuries.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	G W operations achieved a consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate, as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.60 and 0.80 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads in the rail industry was 3.0 in both 2014 (through November) and 2013 (through December).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	Based on these results, in 2014 , G W operations were more than five times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages and safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S3	Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we continue to enhance the use of technology to analyze our track so as to prevent track-caused derailments.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S4	In addition, our information technology staff also routinely assess the security of our computer networks from cyber attacks.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S5	To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions of our networks or operations due to cyber attacks.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S6	Our employees also strive to heighten awareness of rail safety in the communities where we operate through participation in governmental and industry sponsored safety programs, such as Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit organization that provides public education programs to prevent collisions, injuries and fatalities on and around railroad tracks and highway-rail grade crossings.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S7	During 2014 , employees of our railroads made more than 275 Operation Lifesaver presentations focused on the dangers associated with highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad property.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S8	We also participate in safety committees of the AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S9	We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S10	Incidents involving entities previously owned by RailAmerica that occurred prior to our August 1, 2013 insurance renewal are insured under RailAmerica's legacy liability and property insurance policies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S11	Our primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S12	RailAmerica's prior primary liability policies' self-insured retentions were as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S13	The liability policies cover third-party claims and damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S14	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S15	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, and property in our care, custody and control and have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $1.0 million per occurrence, except in Australia where our self-insured retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S16	RailAmerica's property damage policies previously had self-insured retentions up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S17	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P53_S18	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Employees of our United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under our liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	Employees of our industrial switching, transloading and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers' compensation policies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	Employees of our Canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers' compensation policy.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P54_S4	Employees of our Australian operations are covered by the respective state-based workers' compensation legislation in Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P54_S5	Employees of our European operations are covered by the workers' compensation legislation of the Netherlands and Belgium, as applicable.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	COMPETITION Railroads' unique and private ownership and control of infrastructure is difficult to replicate as compared to other modes of transportation, such as trucking (which uses public highways, toll roads, etc.) and shipping (which uses river systems and ports).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	However, railroads do compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes, ships, barges and pipelines.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	In North America, there normally is only one rail carrier directly serving a customer on its line, while most freight is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	In Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	In some instances, we face "product competition," where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments in projects, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including infrastructure and private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller's assessment of the buyer's railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and long-term operator of rail properties, our managerial and financial resources, as well as our commitment to safety and the communities in which we operate, positions us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	REGULATION United States In addition to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P62_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	The FRA, DOT, OSHA and PHMSA have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, which include the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and railcar inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and may regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	In 2014 , the STB continued various proceedings on whether to expand rail regulation.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The STB continues to evaluate the impact of "access" regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure and has held hearings to assess the impact of changes to the access regime in the United States.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	During the past several legislative sessions, bills have been introduced in Congress that would expand the regulatory authority of the STB and could include new antitrust provisions that alter the regulatory structure of the railroad industry.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	Additionally, a two-year DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits, which commenced in 2012 but has not yet been released, could result in subsequent federal legislation following completion and review.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, we continue to monitor these initiatives.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Also in 2014, the PHMSA issued proposed rules concerning the transportation of certain flammable liquids, which includes the transportation of crude oil.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	The proposed rules include a variety of possible measures including enhanced tank car standards, speed restrictions, braking system requirements, community notification and other operating restrictions.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our railroad operations and those of the entire railroad industry could be impacted depending on the outcome of the final rules.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	We will continue to monitor this rulemaking process.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	In 2010, the FRA issued regulations mandating the installation of positive train control (PTC) systems and technology on certain railroads as early as the end of 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	However, the United States rail industry publicly stated it does not believe that PTC can be fully implemented by the end of 2015 due to issues with interoperability.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	As a consequence, members of the rail industry are seeking an extension of the 2015 deadline.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P68_S4	Certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P68_S5	We are working with the Class I railroads to finalize our implementation plans and are monitoring the implementation deadline, though we do not expect that our compliance with the final rules governing the installation of PTC will give rise to any material financial expenditures.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Canada Railroads that operate in more than one province are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules and the jurisdiction of the federal government.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec), Ottawa Valley Railway, Southern Ontario Railway and Knob Lake Timmins Railway are federally regulated railroads that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S4	Railways operating only within one province are regulated by that province and must hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by the appropriate provincial authority.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S5	Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S6	In addition, Huron Central Railway and Goderich-Exeter Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P69_S7	Generally, construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated by the provincial authorities, as are railway services.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada's Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	In early 2015, the Canadian Minister of Transport issued proposed legislation concerning the transportation of crude oil, which includes mandated insurance levels and changes to the liability regime for railroad accidents involving crude oil.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our railroad operations could be impacted depending on the outcome of the final legislation.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	Australia In Australia, regulation of rail safety is predominately governed by national legislation and administered by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator or under a service level agreement with various state regulatory agencies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	Our Australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P72_S2	Regulation of track access is governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P72_S3	The state access regimes are required to be certified by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P72_S4	As a result, with respect to rail infrastructure access, our Australian subsidiaries are subject to the state-based access regimes.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P72_S5	In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	In the European Union (EU), several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	These directives generally cover the development of railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	The EU legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P73_S3	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network, and EU Member States must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P73_S4	These directives have been implemented in Dutch railway legislation, such as the Railways Act, and in Belgian railway legislation, such as the Law on Railway Safety.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment; the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate; the Dutch railways infrastructure manager, ProRail; and Keyrail (the Dutch railways infrastructure manager for the Betuweroute, a dedicated freight railway connecting the Port of Rotterdam to the German border and within the Port of Rotterdam).
1012620_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	All railways in the Netherlands must have a license and a safety certificate issued by the regulator, the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate, part of the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	A rail operator must also have a license from ProRail and/or Keyrail, the Dutch rail infrastructure authorities, to use the rail infrastructure.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Dutch Competition Authority is charged with the supervision of compliance with the European Community's directives on the development of the railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	Rail service providers based in Belgium must obtain a rail operator license from the Federal Minister for Mobility and Transport.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	Rail service providers that wish to operate in Belgium must obtain a safety certificate, which is comprised of Parts A and B. Part A must be obtained from the Railway Safety and Interoperability Service (DVIS) if the rail service provider is based in Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P76_S3	Part B must be obtained from DVIS regardless of where the rail service provider is based.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	In Belgium, the Belgium Competition Authority is responsible for promoting and safeguarding active competition in Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	Both the Dutch Competition Authority and the Belgium Competition Authority work together with other competition authorities and are part of the European Competition Network, the European Competition Authorities and the International Competition Network .
1012620_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations, which frequently involve transporting hazardous materials.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are administered and implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	In Australia, these functions are administered primarily by the Department of Environment at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state and territories level.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	In the Netherlands, European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	European, national and local environmental policies are administered by the FPS Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment in Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	In the United States, we received a notice in November 2014 from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	As a result of our operations, we receive notices from time to time from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our Australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Consequently, the Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	We estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures.
1012620_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Slower growth, an economic recession, significant changes in global commodity prices or government regulation that affects the countries where we operate or their imports and exports, could negatively impact our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For instance, in Australia, a portion of the commodities we transport are supporting economic growth and industrial development in Asian countries, particularly China.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	A sustained slowdown in such countries could impact us.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Slower growth in China, and the resulting impact on demand for, and lower prices of, natural resources could be a factor influencing decisions to delay, cancel and suspend certain mining projects in Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, we anticipate benefiting from development of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from shale regions in the United States, but low natural gas, natural gas liquids or crude oil prices or additional regulations impacting the energy sector could reduce such development and the benefit we could realize.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S6	In addition, we are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P0_S8	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from changing patterns of economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our results of operations and rail infrastructure are susceptible to weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the United States or Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States or Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment or other substantial disruption of our operations and those of the entire freight rail network, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Weather impacts or other conditions that do not directly affect our operations can still impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States, which lessen demand for coal.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our revenues generated from the transportation of agricultural products in North America and Australia are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions and our South Australian grain harvest is also susceptible to the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the Northern Territory.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance, overtime and diesel fuel costs in the winter at our railroads in the United States and Canada related to snow removal, mandated work breaks and locomotive idling.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Adverse weather conditions that disrupt the entire freight rail network can also cause traffic diversions, prolonged delays and equipment shortages that impact our ability to serve our customers, all of which could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our operations served more than 2,000 customers in 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our operating revenues in 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Two of our 10 largest customers in 2014 were located in Australia and accounted for approximately 8% of our operating revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	One of these customers, Arrium Limited, recently announced its intention to mothball its Southern Iron mine, which is served by GWA, citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	During 2014, GWA carried approximately 26,000 carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine, generating approximately A$65 million in freight revenues (or approximately $52 million , at current exchange rates of A$1.00 = US$0.80) in revenue under a fixed and variable payment structure that is customary in large contracts in Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	As a result of the Arrium announcement, we expect to receive only the fixed portion of the revenue following the mothballing of the Southern Iron mine, which is anticipated by June of 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	All of our contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	As a consequence, there is rarely a guarantee that past volumes or revenues will continue in the future.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Further, under these contracts, freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped, and there is no customary contractual protection in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Substantial reduction in business with, or loss of, important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In 2014 , approximately 83% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease or re-route certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The financial impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements, freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We lease several railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under lease arrangements with varied expirations, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 9% of our 2014 total revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 3% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	For example, our revenues associated with leases from Class I railroads and other third parties subject to expiration in each of the next five years (2015 - 2019) would represent approximately 1.9% , 0.0% , 0.7% , 2.1% and 0.0% of our operating revenues in each of those years, respectively, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Changes in commodity prices could decrease demand for the commodities we transport, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Changes in the price of commodities that we transport could decrease demand for the transport of such commodities, which could reduce our revenues or have other adverse effects.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In 2014, the rapid and significant decline in the price of iron ore has negatively impacted the operations of several of our large customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result of surging global iron ore supply, weaker global iron ore demand, and government subsidies of certain high-cost iron ore mines in other countries, several of our customers' mines have become unprofitable.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Agricultural commodities are also susceptible to fluctuation.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For example, a decline in the price of corn that we transport may result in lower revenues for us if farmers decide to store such corn until the price increases.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In such instances, we could experience reduced revenues and unexpected costs associated with the storage of locomotives, railcars and other equipment, labor adjustments and other related activities, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our growth strategy is based in part on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past, partially due to the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant unexpected costs.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Further, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may be unable to realize these savings or other benefits in the time frame that we expect or at all.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements, including renewals of leases with Class I railroads, operating costs, competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	There is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that we will not discover unanticipated liabilities.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Further, while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Also, the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	For example, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P17_S11	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, from time to time we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of cost or risk, which could result in material losses.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil and toxic/poisonous inhalation hazard (TIH/PIH) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Additionally, United States laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	A rail accident or other incident or accident on our railroads, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, insurance premiums charged for, or the self-insured retention associated with, some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads' transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	For instance, existing legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S14	During 2014 , we obtained partial or complete funding by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies for 25 new projects.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S15	The spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 5% of our total capital expenditures during 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S16	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability or require us to accept onerous contractual obligations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S17	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P21_S18	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects, incur additional debt or use additional cash.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We purchase insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments, grade crossing accidents, collisions or other incidents or occurrences.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading, grade crossing accidents, collisions or other incidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other accidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub-limits or give rise to losses or penalties that are not covered by our insurance.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, on certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are operated over the same track as passenger trains.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For instance, in Oregon, our Portland Western Railroad operates certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon and our New England Central Railroad is also used by Amtrak for passenger service in New England.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In Australia, The Ghan passenger train is operated by a third party over the track of GWA (North) Pty Ltd between Adelaide and Darwin.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Further, we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Derailments, collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Moreover, certain third-party freight and excursion train operators have contractual trackage rights to operate over certain of our rail lines.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	These third-party operators generally are required to maintain minimum levels of insurance coverage, but there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all of the losses arising from an incident involving such operators on our rail lines.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property or rail liability losses, as well as subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us, including such things as derailments, accidents, discharge of toxic or hazardous materials, or other like occurrences in the industry, may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims' expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S7	In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In the United States, these agencies include the STB, DOT, FRA, MSHA, OSHA, PHMSA, EPA, DHS and other federal and state agencies.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	New rules or regulations mandated by these agencies could increase our operating costs.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	For example, in 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which generally is to be completed as early as December 31, 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track, and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P26_S8	While we do not expect that our compliance with these PTC requirements will give rise to any material financial expenditures, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In addition, there are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the United States in recent years to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A two-year DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits also commenced in 2012 but has not yet been released, and could result in subsequent federal legislation following completion and review.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Further, in 2014 PHMSA issued proposed rules concerning the transportation of certain flammable liquids, which includes the transportation of crude oil.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The proposed rules include a variety of possible measures that could impact our ability to transport flammable liquids.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Many of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, specific initiatives being considered by Congress, the STB or other regulators could expand regulation of our railroad operations and undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S6	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Expanded regulation of our railroad operations will increase the cost of providing rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In Australia, we are subject to both Commonwealth and state regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In Canada, we are subject to regulation by the CTA, TC and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In the Netherlands, we are subject to regulation by the Ministry Infrastructure and Environment, the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate and the Dutch railways infrastructure managers, ProRail and Keyrail.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In Belgium, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Public Service (FPS) Mobility and Transport, the Regulatory Service for Railway Transport and for Brussels Airport Operations and the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, Infrabel.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Business Regulation" for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S8	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S9	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned or operated by us.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Under some environmental statutes, such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be "joint and several," whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While we maintain insurance for certain environmental damages and claims, environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs and expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination that may or may not be covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement dated October 1, 2012, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated March 28, 2013, as further amended and restated by Amendment No. 2 on May 27, 2014 (Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) contains numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and tests.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our failure to comply with the obligations in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or other debt agreements, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had a total indebtedness of $1.6 billion , and we had unused commitments of $579.2 million under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (after giving effect to $2.6 million of undrawn letters of credit that reduces such availability).
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Subject to the limits contained in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, shutdowns, operational failures or other reasons.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	For interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Therefore, when we are the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and we are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Also, when we are not the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to credit risk at the customer and invoicing railroad levels.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S6	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S7	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular those in the mining and natural resources industry, before the customer commences operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S8	In those cases, we may be exposed to start-up risks that we would not be exposed to in respect of customers with active operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P34_S9	As a result, unexpected credit exposures or start-up delays could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or grant to other rail carriers access rights to our rail lines or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Also, commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S8	For example, natural gas can compete with coal we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P36_S9	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, including the closure of coal-fired power plants we serve, climate change litigation and climate change itself could adversely affect our operating costs, decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, as well as its physical impacts, could materially affect us.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	For example, federal, state and local laws, regulations, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives, equipment, vehicles and machinery or our rail yards.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Further, restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including, for example, coal mining operations, natural gas developers and producers, coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, such as by resulting in the closure of coal-fired power plants that we serve, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change including claims alleging the impact of our operations on climate change.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Any such market or regulatory responses or litigation, as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming, such as floods, rising sea levels and increasingly frequent and intense storms, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	For instance, we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the floating interest rate payments under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	While these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In 2014 , we consumed 47.1 million gallons of diesel fuel.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S4	However, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease and could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 12% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P42_S6	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, environmental contamination, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability against us that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	We are a party to 76 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S5	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 10 of those agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Approximately 1,900 of our approximately 5,200 full time employees are union members.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P44_S7	We have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional 72 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S4	If such Class I railroads were to have a work stoppage or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S6	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, or attract and retain senior leadership, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S7	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S8	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S9	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S10	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 14% of our current workforce will become eligible for retirement.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S11	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S12	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and more generous benefits.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S13	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S14	In addition, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S15	Finally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S16	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S17	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S18	Further, the loss of any executive officers or key employees could require the remaining senior leadership to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P45_S19	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership, and the inability to find a suitable replacement, could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as railcars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	If the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain railcars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	For example, in the event of additional government regulations affecting tank cars, there is no guarantee that a sufficient number of tank cars will be available to support the demand for transport of petroleum products in North America.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In some cases we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S7	For example, in Australia, the availability of new locomotives is limited, with long lead times for delivery.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P46_S9	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Some of our subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Because some of our subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe accounted for 19% , 7% and 1% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the statement period.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial condition and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be canceled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If our concession or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider, but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Further, the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The Netherlands and Belgium also have open access regimes that permit third-party rail operators to compete for the business of RRF, our subsidiary in the Netherlands.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P57_S5	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Continued maintenance of our safety accreditation in Australia is a requirement under our concession deeds and some customer contracts.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Following significant derailments, the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Our ability to use RailAmerica's Section 45G tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation due to a change in the ownership of its stock.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , we had tax benefits totaling approximately $74.8 million of Section 45G tax credit carryforwards related to the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," the corporation's ability to use its pre-change tax attribute carryforwards to offset its post-change income tax may be limited and may result in a partial or full write down of the related deferred tax assets.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	An ownership change is defined generally for these purposes as a greater than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period, taking into account shareholders that own 5% or more by value of common stock.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	While we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax attributes, our ability to use RailAmerica's net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future tax liabilities may be limited.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit expired on December 31, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate in 2015 will be higher if the credit is not extended.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of their tax year.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P65_S3	On December 19, 2014, the Short Line Tax Credit (which had previously expired on December 31, 2013) was extended for 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P65_S4	The most recent extension of the Short Line Tax Credit only extended the credit through December 31, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P65_S5	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, the loss of the credit will increase our tax rate and reduce our earnings per share.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	If the earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries were required to be distributed, our effective tax rate could be higher.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P66_S4	The amount of those earnings was $305.2 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Although it is our current intention to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of our controlled foreign subsidiaries, if the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, and could result in a higher effective tax rate for us, thereby reducing our earnings.

1012620_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of the shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	It is possible that we are a United States real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P67_S2	If we are or become a United States real property holding corporation, so long as our Class A Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder (i.e., a holder that is not a United States citizen or resident, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and certain trusts and estates) who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We rely on the stability and availability of our technology systems to operate our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P68_S2	The performance and reliability of our technology systems is critical to our ability to operate and compete safely and effectively.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	A cyber security attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including security costs to protect our infrastructure.
1012620_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	A disruption or compromise of our information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 15,600 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	Several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire in the next few years and may not be extended.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that could expire in each of the next 10 years would represent less than 3% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	For additional information on these lease expirations see "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We also operate, through various trackage and operating rights agreements, over approximately 3,300 additional miles of track that are owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	The track miles listed below exclude approximately 1,940 miles of sidings and yards, which includes 1,710 miles in the United States, 160 miles in Canada and 70 miles in Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	Track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium are also excluded.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	During 2013, we recorded mortgages on many of the owned properties described in the table below as additional security for our outstanding obligations under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	See "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information on our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our railroads:
1012620_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) The GNWR and DMM are now operated by RSR (2) ALY merged with BPRR in January 2004 (3) BR merged with BPRR in January 2004 (4) PS merged with BPRR in January 2004 EQUIPMENT As of December 31, 2014 , our rolling stock consisted of 1,094 locomotives, of which 932 were owned and 162 were leased, and 24,141 railcars, of which 5,558 were owned and 18,583 were leased.
1012620_15_ITEM2_P4_S1	A breakdown of the types of railcars owned and leased by us is set forth in the table below:
1012620_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability or other claims against us that are not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits.
1012620_15_ITEM3_P1_S1	Based upon currently available information, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The tables below present quarterly information on the price range of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	This information indicates the high and low closing sales prices for each recent fiscal quarter in the last two years as reported by the NYSE.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Class B Common Stock is not publicly traded.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Number of Holders On February 18, 2015 , there were 164 Class A Common Stock record holders and 14 Class B Common Stock record holders.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividends We did not pay cash dividends to our Class A or Class B common stockholders in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future and intend to retain earnings, if any, for future operation and expansion of our business.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	Any determination to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	In connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition in 2012, we sold $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock with an effective 5% coupon (Preferred Stock) to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle).
1012620_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	We paid $2.1 million of Preferred Stock dividends in 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P4_S2	On February 13, 2013, we converted all of the outstanding Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM5_P4_S3	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock in a public offering.

1012620_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) On May 30, 2014, our new subsidiary, Rapid City, Pierre and Eastern Railroad, Inc. (RCP E), purchased the assets of the western end of CP's DM E rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(2) On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	On the conversion date, we also paid to Carlyle cash in lieu of fractional shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock totaling $2.1 million .
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S2	In addition, we incurred $17.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S3	(3) On October 1, 2012, we acquired 100% of RailAmerica for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion , or $27.50 per share, plus the payoff of RailAmerica's debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S4	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S5	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S6	In addition, we incurred $30.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S7	(5) On December 1, 2010, we acquired $320.0 million of net assets from FreightLink.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S8	In 2010, we incurred $28.2 million of acquisition-related expenses charged to earnings related to this transaction.
1012620_15_ITEM6_P2_S9	In addition, we reversed $2.3 million of accrued restructuring expense related to our Huron Central Railway Inc.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Outlook for 2015 Safety Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	We have led the railroad industry in safety for the past six years and our goal for 2015 is an injury frequency ratio of 0.45 reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Agreement to Acquire Freightliner On February 24, 2015, we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire approximately 95% of the shares of Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner) for cash consideration of approximately 490 million (or approximately $755 million at current exchange rates) and to assume approximately 8.5 million (or approximately $13 million at current exchange rates) in net debt and capitalized leases.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Members of the existing Freightliner management team will retain an approximate 5% ownership interest, and we expect to own 100% of Freightliner by mid-2020.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	We plan to finance the acquisition of Freightliner through an amendment to our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), with approximately $650 million from the issuance of new term loans and the remainder from funds drawn on our existing revolving credit facility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Headquartered in London, England, Freightliner is an international freight rail operator with operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Freightliner's principal business is located in the U.K. where it is the second largest freight rail operator, providing intermodal and heavy haul service throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Freightliner operates in open access rail freight markets and therefore has limited ownership of track assets.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	Its fleet of primarily leased equipment includes approximately 250 standard gauge locomotives (mostly diesel-electric) as well as 5,500 wagons.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	Freightliner employs over 2,500 people worldwide.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	Excluding the anticipated benefits from the Freightliner acquisition, we expect our revenues to decrease slightly in 2015 as strong growth in North America is expected to be offset by three significant factors: (1) a decline in iron ore traffic in Australia, (2) the negative currency translation impact of the weaker Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar and (3) lower fuel surcharge revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S6	Fuel surcharges are expected to be lower due to a lower average price for diesel fuel in 2015 compared with 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S7	The growth in North America is expected from: (1) a less severe winter in 2015 compared with 2014, (2) revenues from the Pinsly Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas), which we acquired on January 5, 2015, and the full-year impact of the Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc. (RCP E), which began operations on June 1, 2014, and (3) carload growth and rate increases in our same railroad operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S8	Despite our expectation of a slight decrease in revenues, we expect our income from operations to increase as the growth in North America will only be partially offset by lower income from operations in Australia and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S9	Excluding the anticipated capital requirements of Freightliner, we expect to make capital investments totaling $277 million in 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S10	Of this total, $190 million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital, $21 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in seven operating regions in the United States and $29 million is planned for specific 2015 infrastructure upgrade projects.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S11	In addition, we expect to spend $37 million on business development related capital related to known projects, split equally between track projects and equipment purchases.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P2_S12	Our capital plan excludes acquisitions and new business development projects that arise during the year.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	United States Short Line Tax Credit The United States Short Line Tax Credit, from which we have benefited since 2005, expired on December 31, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Without an extension to the tax credit, we expect our income tax rate to increase significantly in 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	While the Short Line Tax Credit has been extended on four separate occasions in the past with retroactive benefits, we are unable to predict the outcome of the United States legislative process.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	If legislation extending the Short Line Tax Credit were enacted during 2015, we expect it would increase our earnings by approximately $27 million based on our current railroad ownership.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	Corporate and Business Development While we have completed two acquisitions in the past 12 months and expect to close the acquisition of Freightliner during the first quarter of 2015, we continue to evaluate a number of potential projects located in all of the geographic markets in which we currently operate and elsewhere around the world.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	We own and operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S6	In addition, we operate the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin to the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S7	Our operations currently include 116 railroads organized into 11 regions, with approximately 15,600 miles of owned, jointly owned or leased track and approximately 3,300 additional miles under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P3_S8	In addition, we provide rail service at 37 ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	On January 5, 2015 , we completed the acquisition of certain subsidiaries that constitute Pinsly Arkansas from Pinsly Railroad Company for approximately $40 million in cash, subject to adjustment for final working capital.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We funded the acquisition with borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	For additional information regarding the agreement, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Agreement" below.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Headquartered in Jones Mills, Arkansas, Pinsly Arkansas serves the Hot Springs and Little Rock areas, as well as the southwestern and southeastern portions of Arkansas and includes (1) the Arkansas Midland Railroad (AKMD), which is comprised of seven non-contiguous branch lines; (2) the Prescott Northwestern Railroad (PNW); (3) the Warren Saline River Railroad (WSR); and (4) the two Arkansas transload operations of Pinsly's Railroad Distribution Services subsidiary.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Operations are composed of 137 miles of owned and leased track, 77 employees and 16 locomotives.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The railroads currently haul approximately 35,000 carloads per year and serve a diverse customer base in industries including aluminum, forest products, aggregates, energy and carton board.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	On May 30, 2014, our new subsidiary, RCP E, purchased the assets comprising the western end of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited's (CP) Dakota, Minnesota Eastern Railroad Corporation (DM E) rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	RCP E commenced freight service on the line on June 1, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	For additional information regarding this purchase, see "Changes in Operations United States Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad" below.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	Net income in the year ended December 31, 2014 was $261.0 million , compared with net income of $272.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	Our diluted earnings per common share (EPS) attributable to our common stockholders in the year ended December 31, 2014 were $4.58 with 57.0 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS attributable to our common stockholders of $4.79 with 56.7 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 29.1% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	In December 2014, the United States Short Line Tax Credit (which had previously expired on December 31, 2013) was extended for fiscal year 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a tax benefit of $27.0 million associated with the extension of the Short Line Tax Credit.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	Included in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $41.0 million benefit associated with the retroactive extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2012, which was signed into law on January 2, 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	Excluding the $41.0 million retroactive benefit, our provision for income tax was $87.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which represented 27.4% of income before income taxes and income from equity investment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to changes in the mix of income among tax jurisdictions, particularly an increase in United States earnings which were at a higher marginal tax rate.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our results in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Operating revenues increased $70.4 million , or 4.5% , to $1,639.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $1,568.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in our operating revenues included $45.1 million in revenues from RCP E and a $25.2 million , or 1.6% , increase in revenues from existing operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	The increase in our revenues from existing operations was partially offset by a $29.4 million decrease from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Excluding the impact from foreign currency depreciation, same railroad operating revenues, which exclude revenues from RCP E, increased $54.6 million , or 3.5% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	When we discuss either revenues from existing operations or same railroad revenues, we are referring to the change in our revenues, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Our traffic in the year ended December 31, 2014 was 2,007,051 carloads, an increase of 121,039 carloads, or 6.4% , compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The traffic increase included 84,145 carloads, or 4.5% , from existing operations and 36,894 carloads from RCP E. The increase from existing operations was principally due to increases of 32,248 carloads of coal and coke traffic (primarily in the Midwest and Ohio Valley regions), 19,508 carloads of minerals and stone traffic (across most of our regions), 17,397 carloads of other commodity group traffic (primarily overhead Class I shipments), 8,253 carloads of metals traffic (primarily in the Ohio Valley and Southern regions) and 6,299 carloads of metallic ores traffic (primarily in the Australia and Mountain West regions).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	All remaining traffic increased by a net 440 carloads.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Income from operations in the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $41.4 million , or 10.9% , to $421.6 million , compared with $380.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our operating ratio, defined as operating expenses divided by operating revenues, was 74.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with 75.8% in the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we generated $491.5 million in cash flows from operating activities.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	During the same period, we purchased $331.5 million of property and equipment, including $92.9 million for new business investments, partially offset by $28.0 million in cash received from government grants and other outside parties for capital spending and $7.1 million in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	We also paid $221.5 million for acquisitions.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Changes in Operations United States Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc.: On May 30, 2014, our new subsidiary, RCP E, purchased the assets comprising the western end of CP's DM E rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	RCP E commenced freight service on the line on June 1, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	The results of operations from RCP E have been included in our statement of operations since the acquisition date within our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	RCP E operates approximately 670 miles of rail line between Tracy, Minnesota and Rapid City, South Dakota; north of Rapid City to Colony, Wyoming; south of Rapid City to Dakota Junction, Nebraska; and connecting branch lines as well as trackage from Dakota Junction to Crawford, Nebraska, currently leased to the Nebraska Northwestern Railroad Inc. (NNW).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Customers on the RCP E ship approximately 63,000 carloads annually of grain, bentonite clay, ethanol, fertilizer and other products.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	RCP E has the ability to interchange with CP, Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway Company and NNW.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	RCP E has approximately 180 employees, most of whom were hired from the DM E operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	The following acquisition-date fair values were assigned to the acquired net assets (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	RailAmerica, Inc.: On October 1, 2012 , we acquired 100% of RailAmerica's outstanding shares for cash at a price of $27.50 per share and, in connection with such acquisition, we repaid RailAmerica's term loan and revolving credit facility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The calculation of the total consideration for the RailAmerica acquisition is presented below (in thousands, except per share amount):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	We financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's common stock, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of G W's and RailAmerica's outstanding debt prior to the acquisition as well as transaction and financing-related expenses with approximately $1.9 billion of debt from our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (see Note 9 , Long-Term Debt , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), $475.5 million of gross proceeds from the public offerings of our Class A Common Stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) and $350.0 million through a private issuance of Preferred Stock to Carlyle.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	(See Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , and Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Commencing on October 1, 2012, the shares of RailAmerica were held in an independent voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our acquisition date fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in our consolidated balance sheets since December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	The results from the operations acquired from RailAmerica are included among the various line items in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and are included in our North American European Operations segment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a new accounting basis was established for RailAmerica on October 1, 2012 for its stand-alone financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Condensed consolidated financial information for RailAmerica as of and for the period ended December 28, 2012 is included in Note 8 , Equity Investment , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , as discussed more fully under Contingent Forward Sale Contract in Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition (the Investment Agreement).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	The expense resulted from the significant increase in G W's share price between July 23, 2012 (the date we entered into the Investment Agreement) and September 28, 2012 (the last trading date prior to issuing the Preferred Stock).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock in a public offering.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S6	We also incurred $17.0 million and $30.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S7	We recognized $15.6 million of net income from our equity investment in RailAmerica during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P19_S8	The income from our equity investment included $3.5 million of after-tax acquisition/integration costs incurred by RailAmerica in the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, with approximately 2,000 employees, RailAmerica owned and operated 45 short line freight railroads in North America with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces as of the October 1, 2012 acquisition date.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	We accounted for the RailAmerica acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Under the acquisition method of accounting:
1012620_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The assets and liabilities of RailAmerica were recorded at their respective acquisition-date preliminary fair values by RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012, which is referred to as the application of push-down accounting, and were included in G W's consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date (see RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Upon approval by the STB for us to control RailAmerica, our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with our assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2012 (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Preliminary column in the following table).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Between October 1, 2012 and December 28, 2012, we recognized income from our equity investment in RailAmerica of $15.6 million and other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million , primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	In addition, we recognized $21.8 million , representing the change in RailAmerica's cash and cash equivalents from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012, as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	In 2013, we finalized our determination of fair values of RailAmerica's assets and liabilities (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Final column in the following table).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The measurement period adjustments to the fair values were as follows: 1) property and equipment increased $10.7 million , 2) intangible assets decreased $29.9 million , 3) deferred income tax liabilities, net decreased $16.0 million , 4) noncontrolling interest decreased $5.0 million , 5) all other assets, net increased $1.3 million and 6) goodwill decreased $3.1 million as an offset to the above-mentioned changes.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	This resulted in additional annualized depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $4 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	We do not consider these adjustments material to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and as such, prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of RailAmerica were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Australia Arrium Limited: In July 2012, our subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), announced that it had expanded two existing rail haulage contracts with Arrium Limited (formerly OneSteel), including Arrium's Southern Iron mine and its Whyalla-based operations, to transport additional export iron ore in South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	To support the increased shipments under the two contracts, during the year ended December 31, 2012, GWA invested A$52.1 million (or $54.1 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) to purchase narrow gauge locomotives and railcars as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility in order to support the increased shipments under the two contracts.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , GWA spent an additional A$22.3 million (or $19.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2013) on these projects.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	In January 2015, Arrium Limited announced that it is redesigning its mining business and expects to mothball its Southern Iron mine by June of 2015, citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	During 2014, GWA carried approximately 26,000 carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine, generating approximately A$65 million in freight revenues (or approximately $52 million , at current exchange rates of A$1.00 = US$0.80), under a fixed and variable payment structure.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	As a result of the announcement, we expect to receive only the fixed portion of the payments under the rail haulage agreement after the mine is mothballed.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	GWA also provides switching services to Arrium's Whyalla-based operations serving several of its iron mines located in the Middleback Range on the Eyre Peninsula, which services are not expected to be materially impacted by the announcement.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	As a result of the announcement by Arrium Limited, we evaluated our Australian Operations' long-lived assets for potential impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of December 31, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Canada Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd.:
1012620_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	In August 2012, we announced that our newly formed subsidiary, K rail Inc. (K rail), entered into a long-term agreement with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd. (TSMC), for K rail to provide rail transportation services to the direct shipping iron ore mine TSMC is developing near Schefferville, Quebec in the Labrador Trough (the Mine).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	In June 2014, K rail completed construction of an approximately 25 -kilometer rail line that connects the Mine to the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation interchange point in Schefferville.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	Upon receipt of the necessary permits from the Canadian and provincial governments, we commenced shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	Shipments, as anticipated, ceased in the winter and are expected to restart once the weather permits.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operated as part of our Canada Region, K rail hauls unit trains of iron ore from its rail connection with the Mine, and then travels over three privately owned railways to the Port of Sept- les for export primarily to Tata Steel Limited's European operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Results from Operations When comparing our results from operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	In periods when these events occur, our results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	As a result of these and other factors, our results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our results of operations in other reporting periods.

1012620_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our various railroad lines are organized into 11 operating regions.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	All of the regions have similar economic and other characteristics; however, we present our financial information as two reportable segments North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	The following table sets forth our North American European Operations and Australian Operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Revenues from our North American European Operations were $1,325.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $1,243.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $82.0 million , or 6.6% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The $82.0 million increase in revenues from our North American European Operations consisted of a $90.3 million increase in freight revenues, partially offset by an $8.3 million decrease in non-freight revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The $90.3 million increase in freight revenues consisted of an increase of $49.9 million from existing operations and $40.3 million from new operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	The $49.9 million increase from existing operations was primarily related to increased demand for steam coal in the midwestern United States, increased agricultural products shipments and increased shipments of rock salt, frac sand, cement, construction aggregates and industrial minerals in North America.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P51_S4	The $8.3 million decrease in non-freight revenues consisted of a $13.1 million decrease from existing operations, partially offset by $4.8 million from new operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P51_S5	The decrease from existing operations was primarily related to a decrease in low margin construction revenues at Atlas and a decrease in other non-freight revenues, partially offset by an increase in railcar switching revenues resulting from a new customer in Europe, an increase in car hire and rental income in the United States and an increase in car repair services from a new car repair shop in the midwestern United States.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Operating expenses from our North American European Operations were $995.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $959.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $35.5 million , or 3.7% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase in operating expenses consisted of $33.2 million from new operations and $2.3 million from existing operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increase from existing operations was primarily related to an $18.5 million increase from labor and benefits expense, primarily as a result of an increase in the average number of employees; an $11.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to capital expenditures in 2013 including new business development projects; a $2.2 million increase in casualties and insurance expense, primarily resulting from severe weather related incidents in North America and a $2.0 million increase in trackage rights expense.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	These increases were partially offset by a $13.8 million decrease in other expenses, primarily resulting from RailAmerica integration costs recorded in 2013; an $8.4 million decrease in purchased services and a $5.8 million decrease in materials expense, both of which were primarily related to a reduction in the level of construction projects at Atlas and a decrease of $6.7 million due to the depreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our average number of employees increased primarily as a result of insourcing our equipment maintenance activities in the midwestern United States and due to an increase in transportation employees as a result of higher traffic levels.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Revenues from our Australian Operations were $313.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $324.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , a decrease of $11.6 million , or 3.6% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The decrease in revenues included a $15.7 million decrease in freight revenues, partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in non-freight revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	The $15.7 million decrease in freight revenues consisted of $16.4 million due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar and $8.8 million due to an 8,024, or 3.5%, carload decrease, partially offset by $9.5 million due to a 3.9% increase in average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S4	The decrease in carloads was primarily due to decreased shipments of agricultural products and limestone, partially offset by an increase in shipments of iron ore, manganese and copper ore.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S5	The $4.1 million increase in non-freight revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in railcar switching revenues due to higher narrow gauge iron ore shipments and increased railcar maintenance for customers in Australia, partially offset by the loss of track access income from an iron ore mine that ceased operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	Operating expenses from our Australian Operations were $222.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $228.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , a decrease of $6.6 million , or 2.9% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S7	The decrease in operating expenses was primarily related to $14.9 million from purchased services expense resulting from insourcing equipment maintenance activities and $14.7 million due to the decrease of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P53_S8	These decreases were partially offset by increases of $9.2 million from labor and benefit expenses and $5.1 million of materials expense, both of which were primarily related to the insourcing of equipment maintenance activities; $2.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulting from capital expenditures in 2013 including new business development projects; and $2.0 million in trackage rights expense, primarily due to expanded services for an iron ore customer that moves over a segment of track owned by a third party.

1012620_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Carlyle agreed to purchase a minimum of $350.0 million of Preferred Stock, which Preferred Stock was convertible into our Class A Common Stock in certain circumstances.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The conversion price of the Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to our stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in our consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our closing price was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Preferred Stock, and, accordingly, we recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P68_S3	On the conversion date, we also paid to Carlyle all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock of $2.1 million , as well as cash in lieu of fractional shares.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P68_S4	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock in a public offering.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Provision for Income Taxes Included in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a $41.0 million benefit associated with the retroactive extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2012 , which was signed into law on January 2, 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	Excluding the $41.0 million retroactive benefit, our provision for income tax was $87.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which represented 27.4% of income before income taxes and income from equity investment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	Included in our income before income taxes and income from equity investment for the year ended December 31, 2012 was a $50.1 million mark-to-market expense associated with a contingent forward sale contract, which is a non-deductible expense for income tax purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	See Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details on the contingent forward sale contract.

1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S5	The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily attributable to the renewal of the United States Short Line Tax Credit through December 31, 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S6	The extension of the United States Short Line Tax Credit produced book income tax benefits of $25.9 million and $41.0 million for fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S7	Since the extension became law in 2013, the 2012 impact was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P69_S8	Net income was $272.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with net income of $52.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 .

1012620_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our various railroad lines are organized into 11 operating regions.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	All of the regions have similar economic and other characteristics; however, we present our financial information as two reportable segments North American European Operations and Australian Operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency (the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Euro) and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our results of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The following table sets forth our North American European Operations and Australian Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Revenues from our North American European Operations were $1,243.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $585.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $658.0 million , or 112.3% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in revenues from our North American European Operations consisted of a $505.1 million increase in freight revenues and a $152.8 million increase in non-freight revenues, in each case, primarily due to the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Operating expenses from our North American European Operations were $959.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $470.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $489.2 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	In total, labor and benefits increased $177.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily related to the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads and wage and benefit increases for existing employees.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	The remaining $311.7 million increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the newly acquired RailAmerica railroads, including $17.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	Revenues from our Australian Operations were $324.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $289.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $35.8 million , or 12.4% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	The increase in revenues included a $47.4 million increase in freight revenues, partially offset by an $11.9 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S5	The $47.4 million increase in freight revenues consisted of $35.7 million due to a 32,452, or 15.9%, carload increase and an $11.8 million, or 5.6%, increase in average freight revenues per carload.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S6	The increase in average freight revenues per carload and volume was primarily driven by the expansion of iron ore shipments and the resumption of traffic in 2013 that had been halted due to a bridge outage in 2012 as a result of a derailment in December 2011.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S7	The $11.9 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties was primarily due to the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia in the third quarter of 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S8	The depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in a $19.8 million decrease in revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S9	Operating expenses from our Australian Operations were $228.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared with $214.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of $14.6 million , or 6.8% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S10	The increase in operating expenses included increased labor expense, trackage rights expense and additional expenses for fuel and for maintenance of property and equipment, primarily resulted from the expansion of iron ore shipments in South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S11	Operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 also included additional depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of new equipment and an increase in casualties and insurance expense due to an increase in derailment expense and higher insurance premiums, partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease in diesel fuel sold to third parties, primarily as a result of the sale of our fuel-sales business in South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S12	Operating expenses included gain on insurance recoveries of $5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 related to a business interruption claim associated with a derailment in December 2011.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P73_S13	The depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in a $14.2 million decrease in operating expenses.

1012620_15_ITEM7_P83_S16	In connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition described above, on September 19, 2012, we issued 2,300,000 5.00% TEUs.

1012620_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Each installment constitutes a payment of interest (at an annual rate of 4.50% ) and a partial repayment of principal on the Amortizing Note.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	The Amortizing Notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of October 1, 2015 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	If we elect to settle the Purchase Contracts early, holders of the Amortizing Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders' Amortizing Notes, except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the Amortizing Notes.

1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Each TEU may be separated into its constituent Purchase Contract and Amortizing Note after the initial issuance date of the TEU, and the separate components may be combined to create a TEU.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The Amortizing Note component of the TEU is recorded as debt and the Purchase Contract component of the TEU is recorded in equity as additional paid-in capital.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	On September 19, 2012, we recorded $197.6 million , the initial fair value of the Purchase Contracts, as additional paid-in capital, which was partially offset by $6.1 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	Our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the weighted average shares issuable upon settlement of the Purchase Contract component of the TEUs.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S4	For purposes of determining the number of shares included in the calculation, we used the market price of our Class A Common Stock at the period end date.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S5	At December 31, 2014 , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $59.7 million , of which $10.0 million was held in our foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S6	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S7	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S8	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S9	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries; however, the amount of the tax and credits is not practicable to determine.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P86_S10	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 was $305.2 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Credit Agreement On May 27, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (Amendment No. 2), dated October 1, 2012, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated March 28, 2013, pursuant to which our Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement was amended and restated (Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The credit facilities under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are comprised of a $1,520.0 million United States term loan, an A$216.8 million (or $200.3 million at the exchange rate on May 27, 2014) Australian term loan and a $625.0 million revolving credit facility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	Amendment No. 2 also extended the maturity date of each of our credit facilities to May 31, 2019 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and swingline loans.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The $625.0 million revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes flexible sub-limits for revolving loans denominated in United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, with the ability to reallocate commitments among the sub-limits, provided that the total amount of all Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro sub-limits cannot exceed a combined $400.0 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	In addition, under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the existing swingline credit facility portion of the revolving credit facility available under the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility increased to $50.0 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides that borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be denominated in United States dollars, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	BBSW is the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate within Australia, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	BA is the bankers' acceptance CDOR rate, which we believe is generally considered the Canadian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	The applicable borrowing spread for the Base Rate loans was initially 0.75% over the base rate, and, following our first quarterly compliance certificate ranges from 0.0% to 1.0% depending upon our total leverage ratio.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P90_S4	The applicable borrowing spread for LIBOR/BBSW Rate loans, was initially 1.75% over the LIBOR or BBSW, and, following our first quarterly compliance certificate ranges from 1.0% to 2.0% depending upon our total leverage ratio.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	The commitment fee rate was initially 0.3% , and, following our first quarterly compliance certificate ranges from 0.2% to 0.3% depending upon our total leverage ratio.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we wrote-off $4.6 million of unamortized deferred financing fees and capitalized an additional $3.7 million of new fees.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Deferred financing costs are amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the related debt using the effective-interest method for the term loan debt and the straight-line method for the revolving credit facility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Since entering into Amendment No. 2, we made prepayments on our United States term loan of $113.0 million and prepayments on our Australian term loan of A$53.0 million (or $47.0 million at the exchange rates on the dates the payments were made).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding term loans of $1.4 billion with an interest rate of 1.67% and A$163.8 million (or $133.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) with an interest rate of 4.19% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	The United States dollar-denominated and Australian dollar-denominated term loans will amortize in quarterly installments commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2015, with the remaining principal balance payable upon maturity, as set forth below (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , our usage under our $625.0 million revolving credit facility consisted of $43.2 million in borrowings, $2.6 million in letter of credit guarantees and $579.2 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , we had outstanding revolving loans of $11.0 million in United States dollar-denominated borrowings with an interest rate of 1.67% , A$8.0 million in an Australian dollar-denominated swingline loan (or $6.5 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) with an interest rate of 6.44% , which was subsequently paid in January 2015, C$24.0 million in Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings (or $20.7 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) with an interest rate of 2.79% and 4.1 million in Euro-denominated borrowings (or $5.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) with an interest rate of 1.51% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants, which are substantially consistent with the terms of the credit agreement prior to giving effect to Amendment No. 2, with respect to which we must maintain compliance.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	Those covenants, among other things, limit or prohibit our ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness; create liens; make investments; pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock; consolidate or merge or make acquisitions or dispose of assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in any business unrelated to the business currently conducted by us; sell or issue capital stock of any of our restricted subsidiaries; change our fiscal year; enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we may not have an interest coverage ratio less than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	Under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we may not exceed specified maximum total leverage ratios which were modified by Amendment No. 2, as described in the following table:
1012620_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with the covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the maximum total leverage covenant noted above.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	The existing term loans and loans under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our United States subsidiaries for the United States guaranteed obligations and by substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries for the foreign guaranteed obligations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is collateralized by a substantial portion of our real and personal property assets of our domestic subsidiaries that have guaranteed the United States obligations under the credit agreement and a substantial portion of the personal property assets of our foreign subsidiaries that have guaranteed the foreign obligations under the credit agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	On October 1, 2012, we entered into the Credit Agreement which included a $425.0 million revolving credit facility, a $1.6 billion United States term loan, a C$24.6 million (or $25.0 million at the exchange rate on October 1, 2012) Canadian term loan and an A$202.9 million (or $210.0 million at the exchange rate on October 1, 2012) Australian term loan with a maturity date of October 1, 2017.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	In March 2013, we prepaid in full the remaining balance on the Canadian term loan, which resulted in the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.5 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P100_S2	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013 , we made prepayments of $79.0 million and scheduled quarterly principal payments totaling $63.7 million on the United States term loan.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P100_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we made prepayments of A$24.0 million (or $23.6 million at the average exchange rates during the periods in which paid) and scheduled quarterly principal payments totaling A$8.1 million (or $7.7 million at the average exchange rates during the periods in which paid) on the Australian term loan.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	TEUs As discussed above in "RailAmerica Acquisition and Related Financing," each TEU consists of an Amortizing Note due October 1, 2015 , with an initial principal amount of $14.1023 per Amortizing Note.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Amortizing Notes had an aggregate principal amount of $11.2 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	On each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, we are required to pay holders of Amortizing Notes equal quarterly installments of $1.25 per Amortizing Note (except for the January 1, 2013 installment payment, which was $1.4167 per Amortizing Note), which cash payments in the aggregate will be equivalent to a 5.00% cash payment per year with respect to each $100 stated amount of the TEUs.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Each installment constitutes a payment of interest (at an annual rate of 4.50% ) and a partial repayment of principal on the Amortizing Note.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	The Amortizing Notes have a scheduled final installment payment date of October 1, 2015 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	If we elect to settle the Purchase Contracts early, holders of the Amortizing Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase such holders' Amortizing Notes, except in certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the Amortizing Notes.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	In 2010, as part of the acquisition of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities (FreightLink Acquisition), we assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A$50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the carrying value of the loan was A$2.5 million (or $2.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for railcars, locomotives and other equipment as well as real property.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	We also enter into agreements with other railroads and other third parties to operate over certain sections of their track and pay a per car fee to use the track or make an annual lease payment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	The costs associated with operating leases are expensed as incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P104_S3	The number of railcars and locomotives leased by us as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:
1012620_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Our operating lease expense for equipment and real property leases and expense for the use of other railroad and other third parties' track for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was as follows (2012 excludes lease expense related to RailAmerica's equipment and real property leases and trackage rights expense included in equity earnings for the period from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012) (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers and other third parties to operate over various rail lines in North America, with varied expirations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	Revenues from railroads we lease from Class I carriers and other third parties accounted for approximately 9% of our 2014 total revenues.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 3% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires September 12, 2015), around which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three-year term.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and units.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties (e.g., customers) for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P108_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P108_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that, even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Insurance and Third-Party Claims Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims was $26.9 million and $31.6 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims at December 31, 2014 included $15.7 million from our North American European Operations and $11.3 million from our Australian Operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	The balance from our North American European Operations resulted predominately from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a derailment in Alabama (the Aliceville Derailment) in November 2013.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S3	The balance from our Australian Operations resulted from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with derailments in Australia in 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S4	We received proceeds from insurance totaling $13.6 million , $11.1 million and $21.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recorded gain on insurance recoveries totaling $5.8 million primarily related to a business interruption claim related to a derailment in Australia in December 2011.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P109_S6	The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our budgeted capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2015 include $39 million of capital expenditures for our Australian Operations, including $24 million in capital expenditures for new business development.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2014 , there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	(3) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $4.7 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	(4) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures among our existing operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	(5) Includes deferred compensation of $11.9 million , estimated casualty obligations of $5.0 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $0.8 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	In addition, the table includes estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $5.8 million and our 2015 estimated contributions of $0.5 million to our pension plans.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2014 consisted of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses When comparing the effects on revenues of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the year ended December 31, 2013 , foreign currency translation had an overall negative impact on our consolidated operating revenues due to the weakening of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar in the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P116_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	Business Combinations We account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P117_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P118_S1	As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P118_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P118_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P118_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business's acquisition date.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P119_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P119_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P119_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P120_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge's capacity to carry increased loads and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P120_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P120_S3	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P121_S1	As a result, we typically incur minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P121_S2	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P121_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P121_S4	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Estimated Useful Life (in Years) Property:
1012620_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	When factors indicate that an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset or asset group in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P124_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P125_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P125_S4	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded as deferred revenue within deferred items - grants from outside parties, and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year, and no impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P127_S3	Additionally, we review the carrying value of any indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	Impairments are expensed when incurred and are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S4	Incidents involving entities previously owned by RailAmerica that occurred prior to our August 1, 2013 insurance renewal are insured under RailAmerica's legacy liability and property insurance policies.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S5	Our primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S6	RailAmerica's prior primary liability policies' self-insured retentions were as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S7	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, our liability policies cover third-party claims and damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S8	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S9	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, and property in our care, custody and control and have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million per occurrence, except in Australia where our self-insured retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S10	RailAmerica's property damage policies previously had self-insured retentions of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S11	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P130_S12	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	Employees of our United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under our liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P131_S2	Employees of our industrial switching, transloading and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers' compensation policies.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P131_S3	Accruals for FELA claims by our railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P131_S4	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to our employees under our Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_15_ITEM7_P132_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan's purpose.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P132_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P132_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P132_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P133_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P133_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	The fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	The grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	Three assumptions in the Monte Carlo simulation model require management judgment: volatility of our Class A Common Stock, volatility of the stock of the members of the two peer groups and the correlation coefficients between our stock price and the stock price of the peer groups.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	Volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P136_S1	The correlation coefficients are calculated based upon the historical price data used to calculate the volatilities.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , total compensation cost from stock-based awards was $12.7 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $17.7 million , which will be recognized over the next 3 years with a weighted average period of 1.3 years.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S2	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock-based awards was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , compensation cost from stock-based awards was $11.7 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S4	We also recorded an additional $5.1 million of costs from the acceleration of stock-based awards for certain terminated employees related to the integration of RailAmerica.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S5	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock-based awards was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , compensation cost from stock-based awards was $7.9 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S7	The Company also recorded an additional $4.1 million of costs from the acceleration of stock-based awards for terminated RailAmerica employees.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P137_S8	The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for stock-based awards was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1012620_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P138_S1	Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as available income tax credits and capital and net operating loss carryforwards.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P138_S2	In our consolidated balance sheets, these deferred obligations or benefits are classified as current or non-current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	A deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred income tax assets related to tax credit and loss carryforwards, is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, our deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P142_S1	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	Other Uncertainties Our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in our forward-looking statements.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	For a complete description of our general risk factors including risk factors of foreign operations, see "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P143_S2	Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances to which we may be currently subject, and the consolidated financial statements accurately reflect management's best estimate of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity for the years presented.
1012620_15_ITEM7_P143_S3	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 20 , Recently Issued Accounting Standards , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Risk Sensitivity Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The following table presents principal cash flows from our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	(1) Includes an A$50.0 million (or $40.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 assumed in the acquisition of FreightLink with a carrying value of A$2.5 million (or $2.0 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2014 ) with an imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using United States LIBOR, Canada BA, Australia BBSW and Euro LIBOR (as of December 31, 2014 ).
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 1.50% for United States, Australian, Canadian and European borrowings under our credit agreement.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $4.8 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Furthermore, if we were to refinance all of our debt obligations in the current environment, we believe we would incur interest rates no worse, and potentially better, than our current rates.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We apply the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs as a framework for measuring fair value:
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Since our long-term debt is not quoted, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 inputs, including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value of our debt to fluctuate period-to-period include the fixed interest rates, the future interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the debt obligations.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to the changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We estimated the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates, credit risk and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income/(loss), based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of our variable rate debt.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We formally document our hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	On November 9, 2012, we entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	It remains probable that we will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under our commercial banking lines.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The forward starting interest rate swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016 .
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P10_S3	We expect any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P10_S4	The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Our effectiveness testing during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income into earnings due to ineffectiveness.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , $2.4 million , $4.1 million and $4.2 million , respectively, of existing net losses associated with our interest rate swaps were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P11_S2	Based on the fair value of these interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2014 , we expect to reclassify $2.2 million of net losses that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income into earnings within the next 12 months.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P11_S3	See Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 16 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information regarding our cash flow hedges.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , our foreign subsidiaries had $168.3 million of third-party debt denominated in the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P12_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P12_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by our foreign operations and is paid by United States subsidiaries, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P12_S4	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from our United States subsidiaries to our foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P12_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Although cross-currency swap and foreign exchange forward derivative contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P14_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P15_S0	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to a non-functional currency intercompany loan between the United States and Australian entities, on November 29, 2012, we entered into two Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), effective December 3, 2012 and originally set to expire on December 1, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P15_S1	On May 23, 2014, the intercompany loan was repaid and we terminated the Swaps.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P15_S2	In connection with the termination, we paid A$105.0 million and received $108.9 million .
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P15_S3	The Swaps required us to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.25% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allowed us to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.82% based on a notional amount of $109.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The following table summarizes the impact of these foreign currency financial instruments on our statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P17_S0	The following table presents our financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P18_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2014 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 12.2% of our total operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P18_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P18_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that partially offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_15_ITEM7A_P18_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , each one percentage point change in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $1.3 million change in our annual income from operations to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company's internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company's Audit Committee.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2014 , we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report, which is included herein under "Part IV.
1012620_15_ITEM10_P0_S0	We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to all directors, officers and employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Accounting Officer and Global Controller.
1012620_15_ITEM10_P0_S1	The Code of Ethics and Conduct is available on the Governance page of the Company's Internet website at www.gwrr.com.
1012620_15_ITEM10_P0_S2	We will post any amendments to the Code of Ethics and Conduct and any waivers that are required to be disclosed by the rules of either the SEC or the NYSE on our Internet website within the required time period.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Genesee Wyoming Inc.:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P12_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P13_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	Unless the context otherwise requires, when used in these consolidated financial statements, the terms "Genesee Wyoming," "G W" and the "Company" refer to Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company owns and operates short line and regional railroads and provides railcar switching and other rail-related services in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P20_S1	In addition, the Company operates the 1,400 mile Tarcoola to Darwin rail line, which links the Port of Darwin with the Australian interstate rail network in South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	Operations currently include 116 railroads organized into 11 regions, with approximately 15,600 miles of owned and leased track, approximately 3,300 additional miles under contractual track access arrangements, approximately 5,200 employees and more than 2,000 customers.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	The Company provides rail service at 37 ports in North America, Australia and Europe and performs contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P21_S2	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , for descriptions of the Company's changes in operations in recent years.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	The Company's railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	Revenues from the Company's 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% , 24% and 31% of the Company's operating revenues in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P23_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	Revenue Recognition Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company's tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies consist primarily of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	Materials and supplies are removed from inventory using the average cost method.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company accounts for businesses it acquires using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company records the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	As part of this process, the Company identifies and attributes values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P28_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P28_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business's acquisition date.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P29_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P29_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company's short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P31_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company depreciates its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company's major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Estimated Useful Life (in Years) Property:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	When factors indicate that an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset or asset group in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S4	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S5	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S6	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P34_S7	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events in the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company performs its annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P35_S3	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P35_S4	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of any indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Impairments are expensed when incurred and are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets The Company performs an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims The Company maintains liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S4	Incidents involving entities previously owned by RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) that occurred prior to the Company's August 1, 2013 insurance renewal are insured under RailAmerica's legacy liability and property insurance policies.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S5	The Company's primary liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S6	RailAmerica's prior primary liability policies' self-insured retentions were as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S7	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the Company's liability policies cover third-party claims and damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P38_S8	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company's liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company's property policies cover property and equipment that the Company owns, and property in the Company's care, custody and control and have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.0 million per occurrence, except in Australia where the Company's self-insured retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	RailAmerica's property damage policies previously had self-insured retentions of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Employees of the Company's United States railroads are covered by the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), a fault-based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	FELA-related claims are covered under the Company's liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	Employees of the Company's industrial switching, transloading and railroad construction businesses are covered under workers' compensation policies.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P40_S3	Accruals for FELA claims by the Company's railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P40_S4	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of its United States subsidiaries.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	Each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P41_S3	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to the Company's employees under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan's purpose.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P44_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P44_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock over the life of the option.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	The fair value of the Company's restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	The grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Three assumptions in the Monte Carlo simulation model require management judgment: volatility of the Company's Class A Common Stock, volatility of the stock of the members of the two peer groups and the correlation coefficients between the Company's stock price and the stock price of the peer groups.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	The correlation coefficients are calculated based upon the historical price data used to calculate the volatilities.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	Currency translation adjustments are reflected within the equity section of the balance sheet and are included in other comprehensive income.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	Upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying investment in the foreign subsidiary, cumulative translation adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Risks and Uncertainties Slower growth, an economic recession, or significant changes in commodity prices or regulation that affects the countries where the Company operates or their imports and exports, could negatively impact the Company's business.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P55_S2	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	CHANGES IN OPERATIONS: United States Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc.: On May 30, 2014, the Company's new subsidiary, Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc. (RCP E) , purchased the assets comprising the western end of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited's (CP) Dakota, Minnesota Eastern Railroad Corporation (DM E) rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	RCP E commenced freight service on the line on June 1, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	The results of operations from RCP E have been included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition date within the Company's North American European Operations segment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	RCP E operates approximately 670 miles of rail line between Tracy, Minnesota and Rapid City, South Dakota; north of Rapid City to Colony, Wyoming; south of Rapid City to Dakota Junction, Nebraska; and connecting branch lines as well as trackage from Dakota Junction to Crawford, Nebraska, currently leased to the Nebraska Northwestern Railroad Inc. (NNW).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Customers on the RCP E ship approximately 63,000 carloads annually of grain, bentonite clay, ethanol, fertilizer and other products.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	RCP E has the ability to interchange with CP, Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway Company and NNW.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	RCP E has approximately 180 employees, most of whom were hired from the DM E operations.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	The following acquisition-date fair values were assigned to the acquired net assets (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	RailAmerica, Inc. : On October 1, 2012 , the Company acquired 100% of RailAmerica's outstanding shares for cash at a price of $27.50 per share and, in connection with such acquisition, the Company repaid RailAmerica's term loan and revolving credit facility.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	The calculation of the total consideration for the RailAmerica acquisition is presented below (in thousands, except per share amount):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company financed the $1.4 billion cash purchase price for RailAmerica's common stock, the refinancing of $1.2 billion of the Company's and RailAmerica's outstanding debt prior to the acquisition as well as transaction and financing-related expenses with approximately $1.9 billion of debt from the Company's Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement (the Credit Agreement) (see Note 9 , Long-Term Debt ), $475.5 million of gross proceeds from the Company's public offerings of Class A Common Stock and Tangible Equity Units (TEUs) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share ) and $350.0 million through a private issuance of mandatorily convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle) (see Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , and Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments ).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	Commencing on October 1, 2012, the shares of RailAmerica were held in an independent voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered the Company's control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	Accordingly, the Company accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and acquisition date fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets since December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P61_S2	The results from the operations acquired from RailAmerica are included among the various line items in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and are included in the Company's North American European Operations segment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a new accounting basis was established for RailAmerica on October 1, 2012 for its stand-alone financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	Condensed consolidated financial information for RailAmerica as of and for the period ended December 28, 2012 is included in Note 8 , Equity Investment .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012, as discussed more fully under Contingent Forward Sale Contract in Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , the Company recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition (the Investment Agreement).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	The expense resulted from the significant increase in the Company's share price between July 23, 2012 (the date the Company entered into the Investment Agreement) and September 28, 2012 (the last trading date prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S4	On February 13, 2013, the Company exercised its option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S5	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in a public offering.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S6	The Company also incurred $17.0 million and $30.0 million of RailAmerica integration and acquisition-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S7	The Company recognized $15.6 million of net income from the equity investment in RailAmerica during the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P62_S8	The income from equity investment included $3.5 million of after-tax acquisition/integration costs incurred by RailAmerica in the three months ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, with approximately 2,000 employees, RailAmerica owned and operated 45 short line freight railroads in North America with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces as of the October 1, 2012 acquisition date.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company accounted for the RailAmerica acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under U.S. GAAP.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	Under the acquisition method of accounting:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	The assets and liabilities of RailAmerica were recorded at their respective acquisition-date preliminary fair values by RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012, which is referred to as the application of push-down accounting, and were included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet in a single line item following the equity method of accounting as of that date (see RailAmerica as of October 1, 2012 column in the following table).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Upon approval by the STB for the Company to control RailAmerica, the preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were consolidated with the Company's assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2012 (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Preliminary column in the following table).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	Between October 1, 2012 and December 28, 2012, the Company recognized income from its equity investment in RailAmerica of $15.6 million and other comprehensive loss of $2.0 million , primarily resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	In addition, the Company recognized $21.8 million , representing the change in RailAmerica's cash and cash equivalents from October 1, 2012 to December 28, 2012, as a reduction in net cash paid for the acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	In 2013, the Company finalized its determination of fair values of RailAmerica's assets and liabilities (see RailAmerica as of December 28, 2012 Final column in the following table).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The measurement period adjustments to the fair values were as follows: 1) property and equipment increased $10.7 million , 2) intangible assets decreased $29.9 million , 3) deferred income tax liabilities, net decreased $16.0 million , 4) noncontrolling interest decreased $5.0 million , 5) all other assets, net increased $1.3 million and 6) goodwill decreased $3.1 million as an offset to the above-mentioned changes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P68_S2	This resulted in additional annualized depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $4 million .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P68_S3	The Company does not consider these adjustments material to its consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and as such, prior periods were not retroactively adjusted.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	The fair values assigned to the acquired net assets of RailAmerica were as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	The following table summarizes the Company's unaudited pro forma operating results for the year ended December 31, 2012 as if the acquisition of RailAmerica had been consummated as of January 1, 2011.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	The pro forma operating results do not include the impact of any potential operating efficiencies, savings from expected synergies, costs to integrate the operations or costs necessary to achieve savings from expected synergies, or the impact of derivative instruments that the Company has entered into or may enter into to mitigate interest rate or currency exchange rate risk (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	The unaudited pro forma operating results included the acquisition of RailAmerica adjusted, net of tax, for depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the determination of fair values of the acquired property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, the inclusion of interest expense related to borrowings used to fund the acquisition, the amortization of debt issuance costs related to amendments to the Company's prior credit agreement and the elimination of RailAmerica's interest expense related to debt not assumed in the acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	The unaudited pro forma results were based upon the Company's historical consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 and RailAmerica's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and the three months ended December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P71_S2	The pro forma results for 2012 included approximately $55 million of costs incurred by RailAmerica associated with the redemption of senior secured notes in January 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P71_S3	In addition, the pro forma results have been revised to eliminate the Company's $50.1 million mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement in connection with the funding of the acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P71_S4	As a result of these charges, the numerator used in the calculation of pro forma diluted earnings per common share (EPS) attributable to Genesee Wyoming Inc.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P71_S5	common stockholders was reduced by the Series A-1 Preferred Stock dividend and the denominator excluded approximately 6.0 million "if-converted" shares related to the Series A-1 Preferred Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	The pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of the results that actually would have been obtained had the transactions been completed as of the assumed dates and for the periods presented and are not intended to be a projection of future results or trends.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	In July 2012, the Company's subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), announced that it had expanded two existing rail haulage contracts with Arrium Limited (formerly OneSteel), including Arrium's Southern Iron mine and its Whyalla-based operations, to transport additional export iron ore in South Australia.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	To support the increased shipments under the two contracts, during the year ended December 31, 2012, GWA invested A$52.1 million (or $54.1 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2012 ) to purchase narrow gauge locomotives and railcars as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility in order to support the increased shipments under the two contracts.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	In January 2015, Arrium Limited announced that it is redesigning its mining business and expects to mothball its Southern Iron mine by June of 2015 citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	During 2014, GWA carried approximately 26,000 carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine, generating approximately A$65 million in freight revenues (or approximately $52 million , at current exchange rates of A$1.00 = US$0.80), under a fixed and variable payment structure.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	As a result of the announcement, the Company expects to receive only the fixed portion of the payments under the rail haulage agreement after the mine is mothballed.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	GWA also provides switching services to Arrium's Whyalla-based operations serving several of its iron mines located in the Middleback Range on the Eyre Peninsula, which services are not expected to be materially impacted by the announcement.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	As a result of the announcement by Arrium Limited, the Company evaluated its Australian Operations' long-lived assets for potential impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of December 31, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Canada Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd.:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	In August 2012, the Company announced that its newly formed subsidiary, K rail Inc. (K rail), entered into a long-term agreement with Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd. (TSMC), for K rail to provide rail transportation services to the direct shipping iron ore mine TSMC is developing near Schefferville, Quebec in the Labrador Trough (the Mine).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	In June 2014, K rail completed construction of an approximately 25 -kilometer rail line that connects the Mine to the Tshiuetin Rail Transportation interchange point in Schefferville.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	Upon receipt of the necessary permits from the Canadian and provincial governments, the Company commenced shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P77_S3	Shipments, as anticipated, ceased in the winter and are expected to restart once the weather permits.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	Operated as part of the Company's Canada Region, K rail hauls unit trains of iron ore from its rail connection with the Mine, and then travels over three privately owned railways to the Port of Sept- les for export primarily to Tata Steel Limited's European operations.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	Results from Operations When comparing the Company's results from operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	In periods when these events occur, the Company's results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	Finally, certain of the Company's railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, such as steel products, paper products and lumber and forest products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P79_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P79_S4	As a result of these and other factors, the Company's results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to the Company's results of operations in other reporting periods.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	Weighted average Class B common shares outstanding, common shares issuable under the assumed exercise of stock-based awards computed based on the treasury stock method and Series A-1 Preferred Stock were the only reconciling items between the Company's basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	The total potential issuable common shares outstanding, which include options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, used to calculate weighted average share equivalents for diluted EPS as of December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , was as follows (in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The following total number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable under the assumed exercises and lapse of stock-based awards computed based on the treasury stock method were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, as the effect of including these shares would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The following table sets forth the increase in the Company's weighted average basic shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 as a result of the Company's public offering of Class A Common Stock in September 2012, shares issuable upon settlement of the prepaid stock purchase contract component of the TEUs issued in September 2012 based on the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and from the conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into the Company's Class A Common Stock in February 2013 (in thousands):

1012620_15_ITEM15_P84_S3	In addition, pursuant to the Class B Stockholders' Agreement, certain transfers of the Class B Common Stock, including transfers to persons other than our executive officers, will result in automatic conversion of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P84_S4	Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall have identical rights in the event of liquidation.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	Dividends declared by the Company's Board of Directors are payable on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock or both Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, as determined by the Board of Directors.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	If the Board of Directors declares a dividend on both classes of stock, then the holder of each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to receive a dividend that is 10% more than the dividend declared on each share of Class B Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P85_S2	Stock dividends declared can only be paid in shares of Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P85_S3	The Company currently intends to retain all earnings to support its operations and future growth and, therefore, does not anticipate the declaration or payment of cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	Offerings On September 19, 2012, the Company completed a public offering of 3,791,004 shares of Class A Common Stock at $64.75 per share, which included 525,000 shares issued as a result of the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment option.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	Each TEU consists of a prepaid stock purchase contract (Purchase Contract) and a senior amortizing note due October 1, 2015 (Amortizing Note) issued by the Company.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P86_S3	Unless settled or redeemed earlier or extended, each Purchase Contract will automatically settle on October 1, 2015.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	If the applicable market value (as defined in the Purchase Contract) of the Company's Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $80.94 , then the Company will deliver 1.2355 shares per Purchase Contract and if the applicable market value is less than or equal to $64.75 , then the Company will deliver 1.5444 shares per Purchase Contract, with such share amounts subject to adjustment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	Otherwise, the Company will deliver a number of shares of its Class A Common Stock per Purchase Contract equal to $100 divided by the applicable market value.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P87_S2	Accordingly, for illustrative purposes, the following table provides the calculated impact on the Company's weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2014 assuming the conversion of the Company's outstanding TEUs into Class A Common Stock based on the assumptions for the Company's stock price stated in the table (in thousands, except per share amounts):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company's basic and diluted EPS calculations reflect the weighted average shares issuable upon settlement of the prepaid stock purchase contract component of the TEUs.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	For purposes of determining the number of shares included in the calculation, the Company used the market price of its Class A Common Stock at the period end date.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	Series A-1 Preferred Stock Converted into Common Stock on February 13, 2013 On October 1, 2012, the Company completed the issuance of 350,000 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock at an issuance price of $1,000.00 per share for $349.4 million , net of issuance costs, to Carlyle pursuant to an Investment Agreement entered into by the Company and Carlyle in conjunction with the Company's announcement on July 23, 2012 of its plan to acquire RailAmerica in order to partially fund the acquisition.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	On February 13, 2013, the Company exercised its option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock into 5,984,232 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	Dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock were cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 5.00% per annum of the issuance price per share.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S3	Each share of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into approximately 17.1 shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to customary conversion adjustments.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S4	The Series A-1 Preferred Stock were also mandatorily convertible into the relevant number of shares of Class A Common Stock on the second anniversary of the date of issuance, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S5	The Company also had the ability to convert some or all of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock prior to the second anniversary of the date of issue of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock if the closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded 130% of the conversion price (or $76.03 ) for 30 consecutive trading days, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S6	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to the Company's stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P89_S10	In November 2013, Carlyle sold all of these outstanding shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in a public offering.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	For basic EPS for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company deducted the cumulative dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock in calculating net income available to common stockholders (i.e., the numerator in the calculation of basic EPS) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company used the if-converted method when calculating diluted EPS. 5.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses on existing accounts receivable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	Management determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience within each of the Company's regions.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P91_S3	Management reviews material past due balances on a monthly basis.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P91_S4	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P91_S5	Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	Grants from Outside Parties The Company periodically receives grants for the upgrade and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives from federal, provincial, state and local agencies in the United States and Australia and provinces in Canada in which the Company operates.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P92_S4	None of the Company's grants represents a future liability of the Company unless the Company abandons the rehabilitated or new track structure within a specified period of time or fails to maintain the upgraded or new track to certain standards and to make certain minimum capital improvements or ceases use of the locomotives within the specified geographic area and time period, as defined in the respective agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P92_S5	As the Company intends to comply with these agreements, the Company has recorded additions to track property and locomotives and has deferred the amount of the grants.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P92_S6	The amortization of deferred grants is a non-cash offset to depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related assets.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P92_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , the Company recorded offsets to depreciation expense from grant amortization of $10.4 million , $9.3 million and $8.0 million , respectively.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of these risks.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S1	The Company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S2	The Company does not trade or use derivative instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone, nor does the Company use derivative instruments where it does not have underlying exposures.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S3	Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S4	The Company manages its hedging position and monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S5	Management believes its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the Company's best interest.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S6	However, the Company's use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P132_S7	The Company's instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a hedge of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	The portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative used as a cash flow hedge that is offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in other comprehensive (loss)/income.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P133_S2	As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P133_S3	The portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	At inception of the hedge and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P134_S2	When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the period in which it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P135_S1	For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P135_S2	The Company believes such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	The gains or losses from the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not accounted for using hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to the changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P137_S2	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive (loss)/income, based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P137_S3	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P138_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of the Company's outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	On November 9, 2012, the Company entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	It remains probable that the Company will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under the Company's commercial banking lines.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P139_S2	The forward starting interest rate swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016 .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P139_S3	The Company expects any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P139_S4	The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	The fair values of the Company's interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	The Company's effectiveness testing during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income into earnings due to ineffectiveness.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , existing net losses associated with the Company's interest rate swaps of $2.4 million , $4.1 million and $4.2 million , respectively, were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P142_S1	Based on the fair value of these interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2014 , the Company expects to reclassify $2.2 million of net losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income into earnings within the next 12 months.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P142_S2	See Note 16 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) , for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedges.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company's foreign subsidiaries had $168.3 million of third-party debt denominated in the local currencies in which the Company's foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and the Euro.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P143_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of the Company's debt service payments is limited.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P143_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and is paid by United States subsidiaries, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P143_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from the Company's United States subsidiaries to its foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P143_S5	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	Although cross-currency swap and foreign exchange forward derivative contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P145_S2	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to a non-functional currency intercompany loan between the United States and Australian entities, the Company entered into an Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreement (the Swap), effective as of December 1, 2010, which effectively converted the A$105.0 million intercompany loan receivable in the United States into a $100.6 million loan receivable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	The Swap expired on December 1, 2012 and was settled for $9.1 million .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	On November 29, 2012, simultaneous with the termination of the previous swap, the Company entered into two Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), effective December 3, 2012 and originally set to expire on December 1, 2014.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	On May 23, 2014, the intercompany loan was repaid and the Company terminated the Swaps.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	In connection with the termination, the Company paid A$105.0 million and received $108.9 million .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	In conjunction with the Company's announcement on July 23, 2012 of its plan to acquire RailAmerica, the Company entered into the Investment Agreement with Carlyle in order to partially fund the acquisition of RailAmerica.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P148_S1	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Carlyle agreed to purchase a minimum of $350.0 million of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, which Series A-1 Preferred Stock was convertible into the Company's Class A Common Stock in certain circumstances.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P148_S2	The conversion price of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock was set at approximately $58.49 , which was a 4.5% premium to the Company's stock price on the trading day prior to the announcement of the RailAmerica acquisition .
1012620_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	For the period between July 23, 2012 and September 30, 2012, this instrument was accounted for as a contingent forward sale contract with mark-to-market non-cash income or expense included in the Company's consolidated financial results and the cumulative effect represented as an asset or liability.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	The closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock was $66.86 on September 28, 2012, which was the last trading day prior to issuing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, and, accordingly, the Company recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the Investment Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	As discussed in Note 4 , Earnings Per Common Share , the Company converted the Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Class A Common Stock on February 13, 2013.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	Financial Instruments Carried at Historical Cost: Since the Company's long-term debt is not actively traded, fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including borrowing rates the Company believes are currently available to it for loans with similar terms and maturities.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P156_S1	The following table presents the Company's financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_15_ITEM15_P228_S0	RAILAMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P229_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ORGANIZATION RailAmerica, Inc. ("RailAmerica" or the "Company") is a leading owner and operator of short line freight railroads in North America, operating a portfolio of 45 individual railroads with approximately 7,100 miles of track in 28 states and three Canadian provinces.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P229_S1	The Company's principal operations consist of rail freight transportation and ancillary rail services.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P230_S0	On July 23, 2012, the Company and Genesee Wyoming Inc. (G W) jointly announced that they entered into an agreement under which G W would acquire 100% of the Company ("the Acquisition") for an all cash purchase price of $27.50 per share plus the assumption of the Company's outstanding term loan, revolving credit facility and share-based award liabilities (see Note 2).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P230_S1	On October 1, 2012, G W completed its previously announced acquisition of the Company.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P230_S2	Immediately following consummation of the acquisition, G W transferred the stock of the Company to a voting trustee to hold such shares of stock in an irrevocable independent voting trust while the United States Surface Transportation Board (STB) considered G W's application to control the Company's railroads.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P230_S3	Accordingly, G W accounted for the earnings of the Company using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and G W's initial allocation of the purchase price to RailAmerica's acquired assets and assumed liabilities was included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2012.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P230_S4	The STB approved G W's application to control the Company's railroads with an effective date of December 28, 2012, on which date the voting trust was dissolved.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P231_S0	In accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, full financial statements of significant equity investments are required to be presented in the annual report of the investor.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P231_S1	For purposes of S-X 3-09, the investee's separate annual financial statements should only include the period of the fiscal year in which it was accounted for by the equity method by the investor.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P231_S2	Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the period from October 1, 2012 (date of acquisition) to December 28, 2012, the period of equity accounting by the investor (the "period").
1012620_15_ITEM15_P231_S3	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RailAmerica, all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated subsidiaries in which RailAmerica has a controlling interest.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P231_S4	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U. S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P231_S5	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P232_S0	Noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity, in a subsidiary or consolidated entity, not attributable, directly or indirectly to the Company.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P232_S1	Such noncontrolling interests are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within equity, but separately from stockholder's equity.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P232_S2	On the Consolidated Statement of Operations, all of the revenues and expenses from less-than-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries are reported in net income, including both the amounts attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interest.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P232_S3	The amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the Company and to the noncontrolling interests (if any) are identified on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P233_S0	MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P233_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of purchase price allocation, recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P233_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES While the global economy has recovered in recent years from the significant downturn in late 2008 and throughout 2009 that included widespread recessionary conditions, high levels of unemployment, significant distress of global financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been uneven and uncertainty remains over the stability of the recovery.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P234_S1	There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable or that they will enhance conditions in markets relevant to the Company.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P234_S2	In addition, it is difficult to determine how the general macroeconomic and business conditions will impact the Company's customers, suppliers and business in general.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P235_S1	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P236_S0	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet consists of amounts held by the Company that are available for general corporate purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P236_S1	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P236_S2	The Company maintains its cash in demand deposit accounts, which at times may exceed insurance limits.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P237_S0	Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information for the period follows (in thousands):
1012620_15_ITEM15_P238_S0	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P238_S1	Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded by management based upon the Company's analysis of accounts receivable aging and specific identification of customers in financial distress (e.g., bankruptcy or poor payment record).
1012620_15_ITEM15_P238_S2	Management reviews material past due balances on a monthly basis.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P238_S3	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES Materials and supplies consist of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are carried at cost.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P240_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P240_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P240_S3	Major renewals or improvements are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company's short line railroads are geographically disparate businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P242_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P242_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P242_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P243_S0	Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P243_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company's major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S1	When factors indicate that assets may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of assets in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S4	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S5	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S6	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P244_S7	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events during the period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P245_S0	GOODWILL The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P245_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment review as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P245_S2	No impairment was recognized during the period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P245_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P246_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P247_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P247_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P247_S2	The estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment, which primarily incorporates certain factors including the Company's assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P247_S3	Second, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, goodwill would be considered impaired.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	The second step measures the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P249_S0	AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company is required to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P249_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as customer contracts and relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P249_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P250_S0	DERAILMENT AND PROPERTY DAMAGES, PERSONAL INJURIES AND THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS The Company maintains property and liability insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P250_S1	The Company's primary liability policies have self-insured retentions of up to $1.0 million per occurrence as of December 28, 2012, and prior self-insured retentions have been as high as $4.0 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P250_S2	With respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities, the liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials, including expenses related to evacuation, as a result of a railroad accident.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P250_S3	Personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under the Company's liability policies.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P251_S0	Accruals for Federal Employment Liability Act (FELA) claims by the Company's railroad employees and third-party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P251_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P252_S0	The Company's property damage policies have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on type and location of the incident, of up to $1.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P253_S0	INCOME TAXES The Company utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P253_S1	This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P253_S2	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P253_S3	Deferred tax assets are also established for the future tax benefits of loss and credit carryovers.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P254_S0	The asset and liability approach of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P255_S0	REVENUE RECOGNITION Railroad revenues are estimated and recognized as shipments initially move onto the Company's tracks, which, due to the relatively short duration of haul, is not materially different from the recognition of revenues as shipments progress.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P255_S1	Industrial switching and other service revenues are recognized as such services are provided.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P256_S0	The financial statements and transactions of the Company's foreign operations are maintained in their local currency, which is their functional currency.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P256_S1	Where local currencies are used, assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P256_S2	Translation adjustments, which result from the process of translating the financial statements into U.S. dollars, are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment account, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P256_S3	Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for each period.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P256_S4	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P257_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balance by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P257_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012, and is to be applied prospectively.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P257_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P258_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities , which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P258_S1	This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and the interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P258_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P259_S0	2. ACQUISITIONS G W Acquisition of RailAmerica As described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, on July 23, 2012, the Company and G W jointly announced that they entered into an agreement under which G W would acquire 100% of the Company for an all cash purchase price of $27.50 per share, or approximately $1.4 billion.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P259_S1	In addition, G W repaid all of the outstanding debt of the Company.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P259_S2	The total value of the transaction, including the cash payments to stockholders, refinancing of the existing debt, and value of pre-acquisition share-based awards, was approximately $2.0 billion.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P259_S3	The following table details the payments made for the Acquisition (in thousands) except per share amounts:
1012620_15_ITEM15_P260_S0	In accordance with Business Combinations Topic , ASC 805, the Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P260_S1	Under this method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded on the Company's balance sheet at their estimated fair value.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P260_S2	As a result of the Acquisition and the consideration paid, goodwill was initially recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P260_S3	Of this amount, only approximately $25 million will be deductible for tax purposes.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P260_S4	The final allocation of fair value to RailAmerica's assets and liabilities is subject to completion of an assessment of the acquisition-date fair values of acquired non-current assets, deferred taxes and other tax matters, and contingent liabilities.

1012620_15_ITEM15_P263_S1	As a result of the proportional vesting of the awards at the time of acquisition, the total consideration of the transaction included $9.4 million associated with these awards.
1012620_15_ITEM15_P263_S2	The Company recorded $2.8 million of stock compensation expense during the period.

1012620_16_ITEM1_P3_S5	Over the same period, our diluted earnings per common share (EPS) increased at a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% , from $0.29 (adjusted for stock splits) in 1996 to $3.89 in 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1_P3_S6	We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, which has two main drivers: (1) our operating strategy; and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our railroads operate under strong regional management teams, supported by centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , our operations were organized in 11 regions.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	In the United States, we have eight regions: Central, Coastal (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Midwest, Mountain West (which includes industrial switching operations), Northeast, Ohio Valley, Pacific and Southern.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	Outside the United States, we have three regions: Canada (which includes a contiguous railroad located in the United States and is reported within our North American Operations), Australia and U.K./Europe (which consists of operations in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.K.).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge, customer service and safety culture that we view as critical to achieving our financial goals.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Our regional managers focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following five principal elements:
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business and that the attention to detail necessary to eliminate employee injuries translates into efficient, well-run operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	In 2015 , G W operations, excluding our recently acquired Freightliner operations, achieved a consolidated Federal Railroad Association (FRA) reportable injury frequency rate of 0.51 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 74% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	For comparative purposes, from January 2015 through November 2015 , the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average reportable injury frequency rate was 2.80 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 3.04 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S5	Based on these results, in 2015 , G W operations, excluding our Freightliner operations, were more than five times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages and safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P6_S6	Following the guidelines set out by the FRA, Freightliner's consolidated reportable injury frequency rate was 2.11 for the period from March 25, 2015 through December 31, 2015 and we remain focused on improving Freightliner's safety results.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers and each of our local railroads is focused on exceeding customer expectations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	This customer commitment supports not only traffic growth, but also customer loyalty and new business development opportunities.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	To ensure the needs of our customers are addressed promptly, we employ technology-based service exception tools to monitor service information, communicate issues and track corrective actions.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	We engage a leading independent customer-satisfaction research firm to conduct a biennial, comprehensive customer satisfaction survey.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	The survey results are used to measure our performance and develop continuous improvement programs.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	Over the past seven years, we have outscored the trucking industry and all other railroads on each of our biennial customer satisfaction surveys.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	We generally build and operate each of our regions based on the local customer base within our operating geographies and seek to grow rail traffic through intensive marketing efforts to new and existing customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) in 2012 and Freightliner in 2015, we believe that our expanded North American, Australian and European footprint provides us with greater visibility of new commercial and industrial development opportunities in these geographies that should help increase the success of our marketing efforts.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	We also pursue additional sources of revenue by providing ancillary rail services such as railcar switching, repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enable customers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	Separately, in Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, where there are open access regimes in the various countries in which we operate, we compete for new business opportunities at most locations on the open access rail networks.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We focus on running cost effective railroad operations and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated prior to our acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead through our regional structure, consolidating equipment and in-sourcing track maintenance, reducing transportation costs and selling surplus assets.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	At the same time, we seek to improve our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for our traffic type and density.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	In addition, because of the importance of certain of our customers and railroads to their regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P11_S4	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	To assist our local management teams, we provide administrative, commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from scale efficiencies and centralized expertise.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I railroad relationship management.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our operations department assists with implementing our safety culture, conducting training programs, leveraging our scale in purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, ensuring efficient equipment utilization and service design, and providing mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S3	In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S4	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S5	Since 2000, we have added 102 railroads through the execution of our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P12_S6	Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:
1012620_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Acquisitions of additional short line and regional railroads in the United States and Canada, such as our acquisitions of Pinsly Railroad Company's Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) in January 2015, RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company (AZER) in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Acquisitions of international railroads, such as our acquisitions of London-based Freightliner in 2015, FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia in 2010 and Rotterdam Rail Feeding (RRF) in the Netherlands in 2008.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Acquisitions of rail lines from industrial companies, such as our acquisition of railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 2003.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	When we make acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and reduce costs wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead costs, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans, more efficient equipment utilization and enhanced customer service and marketing initiatives.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	In some cases, however, the best way to maximize the value of an investment is to increase expenditures at a new acquisition, such as for track upgrades, in order to improve customer satisfaction and drive additional revenue growth.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	In North America, we believe that our footprint of railroads provides opportunities to make contiguous short line railroad acquisitions due to a higher number of touchpoints with other railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	On a global basis, we believe that our scale, international experience and financial resources enhance our ability to compete for rail opportunities worldwide.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	We have made a number of important railroad investments in North America and in international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	According to the AAR, there were 574 freight railroads in the United States operating over 138,400 miles of track.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	As described in the table below, the AAR classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation) and track miles operated.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	The following table shows the breakdown of freight railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	(1) CSX Corp, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern Corp., Kansas City Southern Railway Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density and intercity traffic lanes.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The primary function of the regional and local railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I railroad networks.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	We refer to local railroads as short line railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Typically, local, or short line railroads, serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Short line railroads generally have more predictable and straightforward operations as they largely perform point-to-point, light density service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the Class I railroads or larger regional railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	A significant portion of regional and short line railroad traffic is driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	For example, a Class I railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold or leased branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	Divestiture of branch lines spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry and enabled Class I railroads to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We operate two regional and 103 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 14,500 miles of track.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	According to Rail Trends 2014, published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are approximately 27,270 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Similar to the United States railroad industry, freight railroads in Canada are also categorized as Class I railroads, regional railroads and short line railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	In Canada, there are two Class I railroads that are largely transcontinental carriers in Canada, with significant United States operations as well, several regional operators and approximately 50 short line railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	We operate eight local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,500 miles of track.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Australian Operations Australia has approximately 25,000 miles (approximately 40,000 kilometers) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers and also connect key mining regions to ports.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, narrow and standard gauge.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Australian rail freight industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	The access rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use, and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Australian freight rail industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track that they own or lease.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	We are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland Australian states and in the Northern Territory.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Since Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition on their above rail business from other rail carriers, as well as from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	The open access nature of the Australian freight rail industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	However, shipments of bulk commodities in Australia are generally handled under long-term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take-or-pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator difficult.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,900 miles ( 4,700 kilometers(km)) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles ( 2,200 km) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	We also have a concession agreement for approximately 800 additional miles (1,300 km) of track in South Australia that expires in 2047.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	Through our concession agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	In South Australia and the Northern Territory, our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad despite the open access environment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P35_S4	In addition, through our acquisition of Freightliner, we also have above rail operations in New South Wales.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	According to Network Rail, the authority responsible for Great Britain s railway network, there are approximately 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of track owned and managed by it and there are seven rail operators licensed for freight transport in Great Britain.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Great Britain s rail network is also open access, which means rail lines can be utilized by any licensed rail operator with an appropriate track access agreement in place.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	In the U.K.'s open access framework, the infrastructure managers must provide access to the rail infrastructure to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P37_S1	As a result, U.K. rail freight customers have access to multiple rail carriers under the open access regime and our operations face competition from both other rail freight carriers and other modes of transportation, such as road and water.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P37_S2	In Great Britain in 2014, 12% of all freight goods were moved by rail, while over the same period, 73% and 15% of goods were moved via road and water, respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,233 miles (3,594 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Belgian rail network and currently there are 12 rail operators licensed for freight transport in Belgium.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	In Belgium, our subsidiary, Belgium Rail Feeding, operates mainly in the Port of Antwerp.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	The German rail network is composed of approximately 21,000 miles (33,800 km) of track.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	There are approximately 385 rail operators certified for freight transport in Germany.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	In Germany, as well as other Continental European markets, the leading rail freight operators are often state controlled, such as DB Schenker in Germany.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	As a result of Germany's open access regime, the rail infrastructure may be accessed by any licensed rail operator.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	In Germany, our subsidiary, ERS Railways, operates intermodal routes from the Ports of Hamburg and Bremerhaven, among others.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P40_S5	Our subsidiary, Freightliner Poland, operates on the open-access rail system within Germany with some cross-border traffic into Poland.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,370 miles (7,033 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	As a result of the Netherland's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	According to the trade association Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are 20 rail operators that provide freight rail services in the Netherlands.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	In the Netherlands, our subsidiary, Rotterdam Rail Feeding, operates mainly in the Port of Rotterdam.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our subsidiary, ERS Railways, operates intermodal routes from the Port of Rotterdam.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	According to the Office of Rail Transport, the railways regulator in Poland, there are approximately 66 rail operators certified for freight transport in Poland operating over approximately 11,500 miles (18,000 km) of track.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	As a result of Poland s open access regime, this rail infrastructure may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	In Poland, our subsidiary, Freightliner Poland, operates on the open access rail system within Poland with some cross-border traffic into other neighboring countries.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	OPERATIONS Through our subsidiaries, we own or lease 120 freight railroads, including 103 short line railroads and two regional freight railroads in the United States, eight short line railroads in Canada, three railroads in Australia, one in the U.K, one in Poland and two in the Netherlands.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Our subsidiaries provide rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	Our railroads operate over approximately 15,600 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola to Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P43_S6	Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over approximately 5,700 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Freight Revenues We generate freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	Freight revenues represented 70.2% , 76.4% and 75.1% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , see the discussion under "Part II Item 7.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized either as interline or local traffic.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Interline traffic passes over the lines of two or more rail carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	It can originate or terminate with customers located along a rail line, or it can pass over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the traffic originating or terminating on the rail line (referred to as overhead traffic).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	Unlike overhead traffic, originating, terminating and local traffic in North America provides us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	In 2015 , revenues generated from originating, terminating and local traffic in North America constituted approximately 93% of our North American freight revenues.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, railroads generally serve from origin to destination with few, if any, interline movements.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Freight-Related Revenues We generate freight-related revenues primarily from port terminal railroad operations and industrial switching (where we operate trains on a contract basis in facilities we do not own), as well as demurrage, storage, car hire, track access rights, transloading, crewing services, traction service (or hook and pull service that requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customers' train between specified origin and destination points), and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Freight-related revenues represented 24.9% , 17.7% and 18.3% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	All Other Revenues We generate all other revenues primarily from revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals, railroad construction and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	All other revenues represented 4.9% , 5.9% and 6.6% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Seasonality of Operations Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or its demand cycle.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	For instance, certain agricultural and food products, such as winter wheat in Canada, ship only during certain months each year.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	In addition, our Australian and U.K./European intermodal businesses have peak seasons late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter of each year.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations as a result of weather patterns.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	See Note 19 , Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited) , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.

1012620_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	In addition, due to adverse winter conditions, we may also experience reduced shipments as a result of weather-related network disruptions and also tend to incur higher operating costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season (i.e., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Segment and Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our segments and geographic areas, see Note 18 , Segment and Geographic Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , our operations served more than 2,800 customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S5	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 22% , 24% and 24% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P53_S6	Two of our 10 largest customers in 2015 were located in Australia, one of which was in our metallic ores (iron ore) commodity group and the other of which was in our agricultural products commodity group.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms generally ranging from less than one year to 10 years.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Generally, our freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	These contracts generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion based upon the invested capital associated with the freight movement and the variable portion based on the actual volumes shipped.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	In the U.K. and Continental Europe, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us and the customer.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration from one to 12 years in the U.K. and one to two years in Poland.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	These contracts establish a price or a methodology to calculate the price.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	In some cases, the contracts provide for a minimum volume commitment by the customer and certain business is also conducted on a spot basis.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P56_S4	Our contracts will typically provide for a price adjustment to reflect any changes to particular elements of our cost base, such as fuel and track access charges.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Employees There are various labor laws governing the countries in which we operate.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 7,500 full-time employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	Of this total, approximately 4,100 employees were union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our railroads have 81 labor agreements with unions.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 14 of those agreements.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 84 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	In Australia, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	In Great Britain, Freightliner has collective bargaining agreements with four recognized unions covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	We have no collective bargaining agreements in the Netherlands or Poland, and we have one collective bargaining agreement in Belgium.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	We believe that we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	The following table sets forth an approximation of union and non-union employees as of the year ended December 31, 2015 :
1012620_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	(1) Also includes employees that have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of train accidents and personal injuries.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	Our safety program was implemented across the Freightliner group of companies following our acquisition in March 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	In order to continuously improve our safety results, we utilize and measure various safety metrics, such as human factor incidents, that are instrumental in reducing our FRA reportable injuries.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Following the guidelines set out by the FRA, G W operations, excluding Freightliner, achieved a consolidated reportable injury frequency rate, as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.51 and 0.60 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads was 2.8 in 2015 (through November) and 3.1 in 2014 (through December).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	Based on these results, in 2015 , G W operations were more than five times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages and safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	Following the guidelines set out by the FRA, Freightliner's consolidated reportable injury frequency rate was 2.11 for the period from March 25, 2015 through December 31, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Freightliner has made significant progress in integrating the G W safety culture into its operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we continue to utilize technology to analyze our track so as to prevent track-caused derailments.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	In addition, our information technology staff routinely assesses the security of our computer networks from cyber attacks.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions of our networks or operations due to cyber attacks.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S4	Our employees also strive to heighten awareness of rail safety in the communities where we operate through participation in governmental and industry sponsored safety programs, such as Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit organization that provides public education programs to prevent collisions, injuries and fatalities on and around railroad tracks and highway-rail grade crossings.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S5	During 2015 , employees of our railroads made more than 570 Operation Lifesaver presentations focused on the dangers associated with highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad property.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P64_S6	We also participate in safety committees of the AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	INSURANCE We maintain global liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and other third-party claims associated with our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $1.0 million per occurrence, except in Australia where our self-insured retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	The self-insured retentions under our insurance policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	COMPETITION Railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes, ships, barges and pipelines.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	In North America, there normally is only one rail carrier directly serving a customer on its line, while most freight is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes, so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	To a lesser degree, we also face competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P71_S3	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	We also face import competition, where commodities we transport face competition from less expensive imported products.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	In addition, some of the products we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments in projects, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including infrastructure and private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller's assessment of the buyer's railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P72_S5	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and long-term operator of rail properties, our managerial and financial resources, as well as our commitment to safety and the communities in which we operate, position us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	REGULATION North American Operations United States In addition to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	The FRA, DOT, OSHA and PHMSA have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, which include the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and railcar inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and may regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	In 2015 , the STB continued various proceedings on whether to expand rail regulation.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	The STB continues to evaluate the impact of "access" regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure and has held hearings to assess the impact of changes to the access regime in the United States.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	During the past several legislative sessions, bills have been introduced in Congress that would expand the regulatory authority of the STB and could include new antitrust provisions that alter the regulatory structure of the railroad industry.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	Additionally, a DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits commenced in 2012.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	The results of the DOT study were released in 2015, but data limitations are expected to hinder any near term changes to the federal truck size and weight limits.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, we continue to monitor these initiatives.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	In 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which, following the passage by Congress of an extension in October 2015, generally is to be completed as early as December 31, 2018.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P80_S3	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P80_S4	While we do not expect that our compliance with these PTC requirements will give rise to any material financial expenditures, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Canada Railroads that operate in more than one province are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules and the jurisdiction of the federal government.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec), Ottawa Valley Railway, Southern Ontario Railway and Knob Lake Timmins Railway are federally regulated railroads that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S4	Railways operating only within one province are regulated by that province and must hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by the appropriate provincial authority.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S5	Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S6	In addition, Huron Central Railway is subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario and Goderich-Exeter Railway is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal government of Canada.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P81_S7	Generally, construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated by the provincial authorities, as are railway services.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada's Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	In 2015, the Canadian Minister of Transport adopted enhanced rules concerning the transportation of crude oil, amending the Canada Transportation Act, the Railway Safety Act and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, as well as associated regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	The effective date for the new rules has not yet been determined.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	The enhanced rules include mandatory insurance requirements, with insurance levels established based on the nature of the commodities being moved on a railway line as well as a per ton levy on the transportation of crude oil and other designated goods by a railway company.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	In addition, all federally regulated railway companies and local railway companies must obtain a Railway Operating Certificate before January 1, 2017 in order to operate in Canada.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	All necessary applications for Railway Operating Certificates are pending for our Canadian railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	Australian Operations In Australia, regulation of rail safety is predominately governed by national legislation and administered by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator or under a service level agreement with various state regulatory agencies.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	Our Australian assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P84_S2	Regulation of track access is governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P84_S3	The state access regimes are required to be certified by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P84_S4	As a result, with respect to rail infrastructure access, our Australian subsidiaries are subject to the state-based access regimes.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P84_S5	In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	U.K./European Operations In the European Union (EU), several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	These directives generally cover the development of railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P85_S2	The EU legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P85_S3	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network, and EU Member States must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P85_S4	These directives have been or will be implemented in legislation passed in each of the European countries in which we operate.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Operations segment is a member of the EU and each one has adopted a similar regulatory regime consistent with European legislation.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	EU law requires each member state to establish an overarching regulatory body for rail, independent in its organization, legal structure, funding and decision making that is also independent from any infrastructure manager.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P86_S2	The regulatory body ensures fair and non-discriminatory access to the rail infrastructure network and will often be responsible for monitoring competition in the rail services market, the licensing of rail operators and rail safety.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	The rail infrastructure is owned and managed by the infrastructure manager who is responsible for maintaining and renewing the infrastructure as well as enhancements to the rail network.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	Access to the network is granted by the infrastructure manager through track access arrangements with licensed rail operators, with oversight by the regulatory body in certain EU countries.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	Currently, all of the infrastructure managers in the European countries in which we operate are owned or controlled by the respective governments in each country.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	The governments of each member state have ministries or departments dedicated to transport who are responsible for the long-term strategy, planning and funding of the transport infrastructure, including rail.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	These departments are also responsible for implementing European directives into domestic legislation.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations, which frequently involve transporting hazardous materials.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	North American Operations In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are administered and implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions, and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P91_S2	As a result of our operations, we receive notices from time to time from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P91_S3	In the United States, we received a notice in November 2014 from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P91_S4	The cleanup associated with this derailment is substantially complete.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	In Australia, environmental laws and regulations are administered primarily by the Department of Environment at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state and territories level.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	The Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our Australian operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	Consequently, the Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P93_S2	Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our concession.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	In the U.K., European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Environment Agency, along with local authorities and other related bodies.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and the Department for Transport (DfT).
1012620_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	In Belgium, European, national and local environmental policies are administered by the FPS Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	There is no principal environmental regulator in Germany.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	State authorities (usually district or county authorities), guided by their respective State Environmental Ministry, carry out day-to-day operational activities.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P96_S2	Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered by the Federal Railway Office.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	In the Netherlands, European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	The principal body responsible for environmental policy and law in Poland is the Ministry of the Environmental Protection, while the principal enforcement authority is the regional inspector for environmental protection.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered by the President of the Rail Transport Office.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements in all material respects.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	We estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures.
1012620_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Slower economic growth, an economic recession, significant changes in global commodity prices or changes in government regulation could negatively impact our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For instance, lower prices of commodities, such as iron ore, coal and manganese, could be a factor influencing decisions to delay, cancel or suspend certain mining projects in Australia and elsewhere, which could reduce the demand for our services.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	If we experience significant decline in demand for our services with respect to one or more commodities or products, we may experience lower revenues, increased operating costs, workforce adjustments and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	In addition, we are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P0_S6	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from changing patterns of economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may be required to forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In addition, from time to time, we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Instability or disruptions in the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access to the capital markets and could also increase our cost of capital.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S7	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S10	If we are unable to obtain additional capital at a reasonable cost, we may be required to forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S11	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Our growth strategy is based in part on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P1_S13	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past, partially due to the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	We may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our operations served more than 2,800 customers in 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 22% of our operating revenues in 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	One of our 10 largest customers in 2015 , Arrium Limited (Arrium), a mining and materials company located in Australia, accounted for approximately 3% of our operating revenues.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	GWA's operations serve two of Arrium's mining assets, one of which, the Southern Iron mine, was mothballed in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the significant decline in the price of iron ore, while the Whyalla-based operations, which include the Middleback Range iron ore mines and the Whyalla Steelworks, continued to operate.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	During 2015, GWA carried approximately 8,300 carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine and, in total, generated approximately A$83 million in freight and freight-related revenues (or approximately $62 million , at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015) under the fixed and variable payment structure that is customary in large contracts in Australia.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We expect to receive only the fixed portion of the revenue following the mothballing of the Southern Iron mine and both the fixed and variable portion from the Whyalla-based operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	We could lose some or all of this revenue if Arrium continues to suffer from declines in commodity prices or other economic and financial conditions.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In February 2016, Arrium announced a recapitalization plan with GSO Capital Partners LP.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The recapitalization plan is subject to a variety of closing conditions, including approval by Arrium s existing lenders, as well as regulatory and other approvals.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	All of our contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	As a consequence, there is rarely a guarantee that past volumes or revenues will continue in the future.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, under these contracts, freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped, and there is no customary contractual protection in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Substantial reduction in business with, or loss of, important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S8	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, shutdowns, operational failures or other reasons.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P6_S10	In 2015 , several of our mining and metals customers instituted insolvency proceedings.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	For interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Therefore, when we are the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Also, when we are not the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to credit risk at the customer and invoicing railroad levels.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular for those in the mining and natural resources industry.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We usually enter into long-term contracts with these customers that include fixed and variable payment terms.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Under these contracts the customers pay a fixed payment independent of actual volume shipped as well as a variable rate per ton shipped, with the fixed payment often representing the majority of the total contract payments.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Under these arrangements, we are exposed to start-up and ongoing operational risks, including exposure to mine shutdowns, that may reduce the variable payments, as well as customer insolvency risk that could impact our ability to collect our fixed payments.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and evaluating credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	As a result, unexpected credit exposures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In 2015 , approximately 84% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease or re-route certain freight movements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The financial impact of such a decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also traditionally have been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements, freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We lease many of our railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under lease arrangements with varied expirations, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 7% of our 2015 total operating revenues.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	For example, our revenues associated with leases from Class I railroads and other third parties subject to expiration in each of the next five years ( 2016 - 2020 ) would represent approximately 0.8% , 0.5% , 1.9% , 0% and 0.4% of our operating revenues in each of those years, respectively, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our results of operations and rail infrastructure are susceptible to weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the United States or Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States or Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment, washout or other substantial disruption of our operations and those of the entire freight rail network, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Weather impacts or other conditions that do not directly affect our operations can still impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States or the U.K., which lessen demand for electricity, which in turn lessons the demand for coal.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our revenues generated from the transportation of agricultural products in North America and Australia are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions and the South Australian grain harvest is also susceptible to the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the Northern Territory.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance, overtime and diesel fuel costs in the winter at our railroads in the United States and Canada related to snow removal, mandated work breaks and locomotive idling.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Adverse weather conditions that disrupt the entire freight rail network can also cause traffic diversions, prolonged delays and equipment shortages that impact our ability to serve our customers, all of which could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Changes in commodity prices could decrease demand for the transport of such commodities, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Changes in the price of commodities that we transport could decrease demand for the transport of such commodities, which could reduce our revenues or have other adverse effects.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In 2015, the rapid and significant decline in the price of iron ore and manganese negatively impacted the operations of several of our large customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	As a result, several of our customers' mines have closed.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Agricultural commodity prices are also inherently susceptible to fluctuation.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, a decline in the price of corn that we transport may result in lower revenues for us if farmers decide to store such corn until the price increases.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In such instances, we could experience reduced revenues, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant unexpected costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Further, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, commodity trends, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served, the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements, including renewals of leases with Class I railroads or extensions of government subsidies, operating costs, competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	There is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that we will not discover unanticipated liabilities.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Further, while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Also, the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	For example, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is no right to indemnification, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Facility Agreement dated March 20, 2015, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated September 30, 2015 (Credit Agreement), contains numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Our Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and tests.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our failure to comply with the obligations in our Credit Agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the Credit Agreement or other debt agreements, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate our indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had a total indebtedness of $2.3 billion, and we had unused commitments of $575.7 million under our Credit Agreement (after giving effect to $4.5 million of undrawn letters of credit that reduces such availability).
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Subject to the limits contained in our Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, changes in the dynamics of global energy markets, including the closure of coal-fired power plants we serve, climate change litigation and climate change itself could adversely affect our operating costs, decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, as well as its physical impacts, could materially affect us.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	For example, federal, state and local laws, regulations, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives, equipment, vehicles and machinery or our rail yards.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Further, restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including, for example, coal mining operations, natural gas producers, coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Significant cost increases, government regulation, changes in market dynamics or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	For instance, over the past few years, production of natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which could further reduce our coal volumes and revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Finally, we could face changes to our operations and decreased revenues associated with climate change.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S10	We may also experience increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change, including claims alleging that our operations have a negative impact on climate change.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P26_S11	Any such market or regulatory responses or litigation, as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming, such as floods, rising sea levels, increasingly frequent and intense storms and any alteration of trade patterns, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of cost or risk, which could result in material losses.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including toxic/poisonous inhalation hazard (TIH/PIH) materials, such as chlorine, crude oil and other dangerous substances that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Additionally, United States laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	A rail accident or other incident or accident on our railroads, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	In addition, insurance premiums charged for, or the self-insured retention associated with, some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these materials.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads' transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	For instance, existing legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S10	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding for capital projects or to benefit from revenue support grants.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	During 2015 , we obtained partial or complete funding by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies for 49 new projects.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The net spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 3% of our net capital expenditures during 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability or require us to accept onerous contractual obligations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P28_S6	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects, incur additional debt or use additional cash.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Freightliner benefits from the U.K. Government administered Mode Shift Revenue Support Scheme (MSRS), which supports the movement of freight away from road, particularly in the container market.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While the U.K. Government has confirmed its continued funding of MSRS for England, the amount of the funding available for the period 2016 to 2020 will be less than for the period 2010 to 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The basis on which the reductions should be applied remains subject to review and may result in reduced grants in 2016 and in subsequent years.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Reduced grants may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We purchase insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments, grade crossing accidents, collisions and other incidents or occurrences.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading, grade crossing accidents, collisions or other incidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other accidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub-limits or give rise to losses or penalties that are not covered by our insurance.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, on certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are operated over the same track as passenger trains.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	For instance, in Oregon, our Portland Western Railroad operates certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, our New England Central Railroad is also used by Amtrak for passenger service in New England and our Connecticut Southern Railroad operates over Amtrak trackage in Connecticut.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In Australia, The Ghan passenger train is operated by a third party over the track of GWA (North) Pty Ltd between Tarcoola and Darwin.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Further, we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In the U.K. and Continental Europe, freight trains are primarily operated over the same track as passenger trains and will also regularly pass through passenger stations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Derailments, collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Moreover, certain third-party freight and excursion train operators have contractual rights to operate over certain of our rail lines.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These third-party operators generally are required to maintain minimum levels of insurance coverage, but there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all of the losses arising from an incident involving such operators on our rail lines.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property or rail liability losses, as well as subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us, including such things as derailments, accidents, discharge of toxic or hazardous materials, or other like occurrences in the industry, may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims' expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S5	In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	New rules or regulations mandated by these agencies could increase our operating costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	For example, in 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which, following the passage by Congress of an extension in October 2015, generally is to be completed as early as December 31, 2018.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track, and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads may be required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P35_S7	While we do not expect that our compliance with these PTC requirements will give rise to any material financial expenditures, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition, there are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the United States in recent years to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Various proceedings have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition, interchange commitments and competitive access.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	A DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits also commenced in 2012.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The results of the DOT study were released in 2015, but data limitations are expected to hinder any near term changes to the federal truck size and weight limits.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Many of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, specific initiatives being considered by Congress, the STB or other regulators could expand regulation of our railroad operations and undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Expanded regulation of our railroad operations will increase the cost of providing rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Currently, there are ongoing governmental reviews into the structure, roles and functions of both the ORR and Network Rail.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The results of these reviews may affect our operations and increase our operating costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Business Regulation" for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S6	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S7	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us, properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned or operated by us.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Under some environmental statutes, such liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be "joint and several," whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain environmental damages and claims, environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs and expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination that may or may not be fully covered by our insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or grant to other rail carriers access rights to our rail lines or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S6	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Also, commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S8	For example, natural gas can compete with coal that we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S9	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S10	In addition, we are subject to import competition, where commodities that we transport face competition from less expensive imported products.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Some of the products that we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S12	The extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S13	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S14	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S15	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S16	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S17	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P42_S18	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	For instance, we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the floating interest rate payments under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	While these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In 2015 , we consumed 63.3 million gallons of diesel fuel.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war, terrorist attack or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices, although there may be a significant delay in our recovery of fuel costs based on the terms of the fuel surcharge program.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	However, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease, which could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 8% and 12% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S6	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, environmental contamination, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S7	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S8	FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S9	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S10	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability against us that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S11	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S12	We are a party to 81 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S13	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 14 of those agreements.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S14	Approximately 4,100 of our approximately 7,500 full time employees are either union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P47_S15	We also have entered into employee association agreements with an additional 84 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If such Class I railroads were to have a work slowdown or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In the U.K., our operations are reliant on the rail infrastructure provided by Network Rail.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	A majority of Networks Rail s employees are unionized, and if Network Rail were to have a work stoppage or strike, the U.K. rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, or attract and retain senior leadership, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 14% of our current workforce will become eligible for retirement.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S9	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and more generous benefits.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P49_S10	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The execution of our growth strategy, in particular our acquisition and investment strategy, is substantially dependent on our senior management team.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We rely on our senior management team to execute our growth strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our growth strategy is different than the strategy of many other railroads because of our acquisition and investment focus.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Further, the loss of any executive officers or key employees could require the remaining senior leadership to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S7	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership, and the inability to find a suitable replacement, could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as railcars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S10	If the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain railcars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S11	In some cases, we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S12	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S13	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S14	For example, in Australia, the availability of new locomotives is limited, with long lead times for delivery.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S15	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P50_S16	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We rely on the stability and availability of our technology systems to operate our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	The performance and reliability of our technology systems is critical to our ability to operate and compete safely and effectively.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	A cyber security attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including security costs to protect our infrastructure.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	A disruption or compromise of our information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Some of our subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the U.K., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Because some of our subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our operations in Australia, Canada and Europe account for approximately 10%, 2% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated income from operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Polish zloty) and then translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average exchange rate for the statement period.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P56_S5	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our consolidated results of operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be canceled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	If our concession or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Further, the expiration of these agreements and the end of their term would result in the loss of the associated revenues and income.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	European countries in which our subsidiaries operate also have open access regimes that permit third-party rail operators to compete for the business of our subsidiaries that operate in such countries.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	The loss of our customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S5	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S6	In the U.K., if the ORR were to change the access regime, even if we were able to pass any increased fees onto customers, we may be less competitive and our revenues could decline.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S7	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S8	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S9	Changes to the open access regimes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P62_S10	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia and Europe hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Following significant derailments, the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Freightliner has significant pension funding obligations.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Freightliner provides a defined benefit pension program for its U.K. employees through a standalone shared cost arrangement within the Railways Pension Scheme (Pension Program).
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The Pension Program has more than 300,000 active and retired employees, and participation by more than 150 rail companies with assets under management in excess of 20 billion .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	There are six discrete sections within the Pension Program and participating employers may set up more than one arrangement in the program.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	There is no cross-subsidy or funding obligation between the discrete sections of the Pension Program or between the discrete arrangements of any participating employers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The Pension Program is managed and administered by a professional pension administration company and is overseen by trustees with professional advice from independent actuaries and other advisers.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The Freightliner section of the Pension Program is a shared cost arrangement with required contributions shared between Freightliner and its employees with Freightliner contributing 60% and the remaining 40% contributed by active employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The Pension Program's assets are subject to market fluctuation, and its assets and liabilities are formally valued on an independent actuarial basis every three years.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	A key element of the valuation process is an assessment of the creditworthiness of the participating employer.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Less creditworthy employers are encouraged to invest in lower risk assets, with on average lower returns, which impacts the assessment of the pension liabilities and any underlying deficit.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In the event that the Freightliner section of the Pension Program is underfunded on an actuarial basis at any valuation point, the shared cost nature of the program means that Freightliner is responsible for paying 60% of any deficit contributions, with active employees contributing the remaining 40%, in each case over a recovery period agreed with the trustees.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	If the Freightliner section of the Pension Program is terminated and wound up, any deficit would fall entirely on Freightliner and would not be shared with active employees.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Equally, if all active employees were to leave the Freightliner section, Freightliner would have full responsibility for funding any deficits.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	were approximately 1,700 active Freightliner employees in the Freightliner section of the Pension Program.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Freightliner s pension expense and funding of its section of the Pension Program may increase in the future and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Our ability to use RailAmerica's Section 45G tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation due to a change in the ownership of its stock.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P69_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we had tax benefits totaling approximately $63.2 million of Section 45G tax credit carryforwards related to the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," the corporation's ability to use its pre-change tax attribute carryforwards to offset its post-change income tax may be limited and may result in a partial or full write down of the related deferred tax assets.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	An ownership change is defined generally for these purposes as a greater than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period, taking into account shareholders that own 5% or more by value of common stock.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	While we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax attributes, our ability to use RailAmerica's tax credit carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce our future tax liabilities may be limited.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit expires on December 31, 2016.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate in 2017 will be higher if the credit is not extended.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures, owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P73_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of its tax year.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P73_S3	On December 18, 2015, the Short Line Tax Credit (which had previously expired on December 31, 2014) was extended for 2015 and 2016.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P73_S4	The most recent extension of the Short Line Tax Credit only extended the credit through December 31, 2016.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P73_S5	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, the loss of the credit will increase our tax rate and reduce our earnings per share.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	If the earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries were required to be distributed, our effective tax rate could be higher.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of their respective countries.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P74_S3	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P74_S4	The amount of those earnings was $322.5 million as of December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P74_S5	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, which could result in a higher effective tax rate for us, thereby reducing our earnings.

1012620_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of the shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	It is possible that we are a United States real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	If we are or become a United States real property holding corporation, so long as our Class A Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder (i.e., a holder that is not a United States citizen or resident, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and certain trusts and estates) who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our Class A Common Stock, by reason of our status as a United States real property holding corporation.
1012620_16_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The rail properties that we own and operate in North America typically consist of the track and the underlying land.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	Real estate adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way is generally owned by others, and our holdings of such real estate are not material.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Further, unless we own the rail properties outright, we do not normally control mineral rights or the ability to grant fiber optic and other easements in the properties.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Several of our railroads are operated under leases or operating licenses in which we do not assume ownership of the track or the underlying land.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	Further, under open access regimes as more fully described under "Part I Item 1.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	Business," the track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 15,600 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	Several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire in the next few years and may not be extended.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P2_S2	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that could expire in each of the next 10 years would represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM2_P2_S3	For additional information on these lease expirations, see "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	We also operate, through various trackage and operating rights agreements, over approximately 5,700 additional miles of track that are owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	The track miles listed below exclude approximately 1,995 miles of sidings and yards ( 1,765 miles in the United States, 160 miles in Canada and 70 miles in Australia).
1012620_16_ITEM2_P3_S2	Track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.K. are also excluded.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	We have recorded mortgages on many of the owned properties located in the United States and described in the table below as additional security for our outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P4_S1	See "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information on our Credit Agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our railroads as of December 31, 2015:
1012620_16_ITEM2_P6_S0	(1) The GNWR and DMM are now operated by RSR (2) ALY merged with BPRR in January 2004 (3) BR merged with BPRR in January 2004 (4) PS merged with BPRR in January 2004 EQUIPMENT As of December 31, 2015 , our rolling stock consisted of 1,344 locomotives, of which 1,011 were owned and 333 were leased, and 29,225 railcars, of which 7,406 were owned and 21,819 were leased.
1012620_16_ITEM2_P6_S1	A breakdown of the types of railcars owned and leased by us as of December 31, 2015 is set forth in the table below:
1012620_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability or other claims against us that are not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits.
1012620_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	Based upon currently available information, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM3_P1_S2	See "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional information.

1012620_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Number of Holders On February 19, 2016 , there were 353 Class A Common Stock record holders and 11 Class B Common Stock record holders.
1012620_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividends We did not pay cash dividends to our Class A or Class B common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1012620_16_ITEM5_P3_S1	We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future and intend to retain earnings, if any, for future operation and expansion of our business.
1012620_16_ITEM5_P3_S2	Any determination to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement.

1012620_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) On January 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Pinsly Arkansas for $41.3 million in cash.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	On March 25, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, for total consideration of 516.3 million (or $769.1 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	In addition, we incurred $12.6 million of acquisition costs and $2.6 million of integration costs associated with Freightliner during 2015 and recorded a loss of $18.7 million on the settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts during 2015, which were entered into in contemplation of the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P2_S2	(2) On May 30, 2014, our new subsidiary, Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc. (RCP E), purchased the assets of the western end of CP's DM E rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P2_S3	(3) On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock totaling $2.1 million .
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	In addition, we incurred $17.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2013.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	(4) On October 1, 2012, we acquired 100% of RailAmerica for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion , or $27.50 per share, plus the payoff of RailAmerica's debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S3	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S4	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S5	In addition, we incurred $30.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2012.
1012620_16_ITEM6_P3_S6	We also recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense in 2012 related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Outlook for 2016 Financial Expectations We expect our revenues to be flat year over year as the full year impact of the Freightliner acquisition is offset by four significant factors: (1) the negative currency translation impact of the weaker Australian and Canadian dollars, the British pound and the Euro relative to the United States dollar, (2) a decline in coal traffic in the United States and the United Kingdom due to competition from low-priced natural gas, (3) a decline in traffic from mining customers in Australia due to mine closures in 2015 and (4) lower fuel surcharge revenues.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Fuel surcharges are expected to be lower due to a lower average price for diesel fuel in 2016 compared with 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	We expect our income from operations to decline as the negative impact of the lower coal and Australia mining customer revenues, lower fuel surcharges and the impact of currency translation will only be partially offset by pricing increases, expense reductions and the full year impact of the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	We expect to make capital investments totaling $225 million in 2016.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	Of this total, $175 million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital and $15 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in the United States.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	In addition, we expect to spend $35 million on new business investments, which include track projects, equipment purchases and investments in new facilities.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P0_S6	Our capital plan excludes acquisitions and new business development projects that arise during the year.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	United States Short Line Tax Credit The United States Short Line Tax Credit, from which we have benefited since 2005, will expire on December 31, 2016.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Without an extension to the tax credit, we expect our income tax rate to increase significantly in 2017.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	While the Short Line Tax Credit has been extended on five separate occasions in the past, we are unable to predict the outcome of the United States legislative process.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Short Line Tax Credit will provide a net tax benefit of approximately $27 million in 2016 based on our current railroad ownership.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We continue to evaluate a number of potential projects located in all of the geographic markets in which we currently operate and elsewhere around the world.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Overview We own and operate 120 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in 11 operating regions with 7,500 employees and more than 2,800 customers.

1012620_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar will impact our results of operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	On March 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Certain former management shareholders of Freightliner (Management Shareholders) retained an approximate 6% economic interest in Freightliner in the form of deferred consideration.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	We expect to settle the deferred consideration by the end of 2020.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	For additional information regarding the deferred consideration, see Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.

1012620_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	The increase in our operating ratio was primarily driven by lower operating margins from Freightliner, which operates in an open access environment using primarily leased equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P13_S7	Our same railroad operating ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 76.2% , compared with 74.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	When we discuss either operating ratios from existing operations or same railroad operating ratios, we are referring to the change in our operating ratio, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (excluding the impact of acquisitions).

1012620_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Australia Arrium Limited: Between 2011 and 2014, our subsidiary, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA), invested a total of A$78.0 million (or $77.7 million at the exchange rates on the dates the spending occurred) to purchase locomotives and railcars, as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility to support iron ore shipments from Arrium's Southern Iron mine and Whyalla-based operations, which include the Middleback Range iron ore mines and the Whyalla steelworks.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Arrium mothballed its Southern Iron mine in April 2015, citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore, while the mines in the Middleback Range continued to operate.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	During 2015, GWA carried approximately 8,300 carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine and, in total, generated approximately A$83 million in freight and freight-related revenues (or approximately $62 million , at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015) under the fixed and variable payment structure that is customary in large contracts in Australia.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	We expect to receive only the fixed portion of the revenue following the mothballing of the Southern Iron mine and both the fixed and variable portion from the Whyalla-based operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	We could lose some or all of this revenue if Arrium continues to suffer from declines in commodity prices or other economic and financial conditions.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	In February 2016, Arrium announced a recapitalization plan with GSO Capital Partners LP.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The recapitalization plan is subject to a variety of closing conditions, including approval by Arrium s existing lenders, as well as regulatory and other approvals.

1012620_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	The increase included $530.0 million from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of $131.3 million from existing operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	When we discuss expenses from existing operations, we are referring to the change in our expenses, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decrease from existing operations was primarily due to a decrease of $54.4 million from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar and decreases of $54.8 million in diesel fuel used in train operations, $11.4 million in materials, $10.7 million in purchased services, $10.2 million in trackage rights and $9.0 million in equipment rents, partially offset by increases of $13.1 million in depreciation and amortization and $8.2 million in other expenses.

1012620_16_ITEM7_P82_S10	The increase was primarily due to an increase in derailment expense.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P82_S11	Materials expense was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $5.1 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P82_S12	The increase in materials expense was primarily attributable to the increase in materials purchased to support the insourcing of equipment maintenance activities.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P82_S13	Trackage rights expense was $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $2.0 million , or 10.2% .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P82_S14	The increase in trackage rights expense was primarily attributable to expanded services for an iron ore customer that moves over a segment of track owned by a third party.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P82_S15	Other expenses were $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $4.9 million , or 61.4% , primarily resulting from third-party projects.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Income from Operations/Operating Ratio Income from operations from our Australian Operations was $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $95.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the net impact from foreign currency depreciation.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	The operating ratio was 71.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with 70.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	The following table sets forth our U.K./European Operations operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Freight-Related Revenues Prior to our acquisition of Freightliner in March of 2015, freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations consisted primarily of port switching.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	Freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations increased $6.3 million , or 42.7% , to $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	Operating Expenses Total operating expenses from our U.K./European Operations were $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , an increase of $7.3 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	The increase was entirely from existing operations and primarily related to an increase in business.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P84_S4	The following table sets forth operating expenses from our U.K./European Operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Income/(Loss) from Operations Loss from operations from our U.K./European Operations was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared with a $1.0 million loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	The loss from our U.K./European Operations in 2013 included extra operating expenses incurred as a result of third party accidents, as well as higher staffing and training expenses incurred in preparation for a significant new long-term customer contract that commenced in early 2014 to provide shuttle service between Rotterdam and the German border.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	In 2014, the loss widened as expected during the ramp-up period of the new shuttle service.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	Liquidity and Capital Resources We had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $35.9 million and $59.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	Based on current expectations, we believe our cash and other liquid assets, anticipated future cash flows, availability under our credit agreement, access to debt and equity capital markets and sources of available financing will be sufficient to fund expected operating, capital and debt service requirements and other financial commitments for the foreseeable future.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S5	At December 31, 2015 , we had long-term debt, including current portion, of $2,305.3 million , which comprised 47.8% of our total capitalization, and $575.7 million of unused borrowing capacity.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P85_S6	At December 31, 2014 , we had long-term debt, including current portion, totaling $1,615.4 million , which comprised 40.7% of our total capitalization.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we completed the acquisition of Freightliner for cash consideration of 492.1 million (or $733.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	We financed the acquisition through a combination of available cash and borrowings under the Credit Agreement (see Credit Agreement below).
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we generated $475.1 million , $491.5 million and $413.5 million , respectively, of cash from operating activities.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	Changes in working capital decreased net cash flows from operating activities by $8.5 million , $3.6 million and $26.1 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S4	The 2015 period included $33.2 million of cash used for Freightliner acquisition and integration costs.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S5	The 2013 period included $12.9 million in cash paid for expenses related to the integration of RailAmerica.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S6	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , our cash used in investing activities was $1,074.3 million , $509.8 million and $208.7 million , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S7	For 2015 , primary drivers of cash used in investing activities were $740.2 million of cash paid for acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Freightliner and Pinsly Arkansas, $371.5 million of cash used for capital expenditures, including $65.6 million for new business investments and $18.7 million of net cash paid for the settlement of the foreign currency forward purchase contracts related to the acquisition of Freightliner, partially offset by $41.7 million in cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending and $10.4 million of insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S8	For 2014 , primary drivers of cash used in investing activities were $331.5 million of cash used for capital expenditures, including $92.9 million for new business investments, $221.5 million of cash paid for acquisitions, predominately for the RCP E acquisition, partially offset by $28.0 million in cash received from grants from outside parties for capital spending, $8.0 million of insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets and $7.1 million in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S9	For 2013 , primary drivers of cash used in investing activities were $249.3 million of cash used for capital expenditures, including $34.2 million for new business investments, partially offset by $33.9 million in cash received from grants from outside parties and $6.7 million in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.

1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S11	During 2013 , our cash used in financing activities was $205.9 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S12	For 2015 , the primary driver of cash provided by financing activities was net proceeds of $586.2 million , which was predominately related to borrowings from the refinancing of the Credit Agreement in conjunction with our acquisition of Freightliner.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S13	For 2014 , the primary driver of cash flows provided by financing activities was net cash inflows of $13.9 million from exercises of stock-based awards.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P86_S14	For 2013 , the primary driver of cash used in financing activities was a net decrease in outstanding debt of $209.3 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cash Repatriation At December 31, 2015 , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.9 million , of which $28.3 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P87_S4	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries; however, the amount of the tax and credits is not practicable to determine.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P87_S5	The amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 was $322.5 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	In anticipation of our acquisition of Freightliner, we entered into the Credit Agreement on March 20, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Australian term loan, a 101.7 million (or $152.2 million at the exchange rate on March 20, 2015) U.K. term loan and a $625.0 million revolving credit facility.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	The revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and swingline loans.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	The maturity date of each of our credit facilities under the Credit Agreement is March 31, 2020 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	On September 30, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment) to the Credit Agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	The Amendment added a senior secured leverage ratio covenant that requires us to comply with maximum ratios of senior secured indebtedness, subject, if applicable, to netting of certain cash and cash equivalents to earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	For additional information regarding our Credit Agreement, Credit Agreement Amendment and the Prior Credit Agreement, see Note 8 , Long-Term Debt , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S4	On September 19, 2012, we issued 2,300,000 5.00% TEUs.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S5	Each TEU initially consisted of a prepaid stock purchase contract (Purchase Contract) and a senior amortizing note due October 1, 2015 (Amortizing Note) issued by us, which had an initial principal amount of $14.1023 per Amortizing Note.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S6	On each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1, we paid the holders of Amortizing Notes equal quarterly installments of $1.25 per Amortizing Note (except for the January 1, 2013 installment payment, which was $1.4167 per Amortizing Note), which cash payments in the aggregate were equivalent to a 5.00% cash payment per year with respect to each $100 stated amount of the TEUs.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S7	On October 1, 2015, we settled the remaining balance of the amortizing note component of the TEUs for a total cash payment of $2.8 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P90_S8	In addition, we settled the prepaid stock purchase contract component of the TEUs with the delivery of 3,539,240 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	In 2010, as part of the acquisition of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities (FreightLink Acquisition), we assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A$50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of the loan was A$2.7 million (or $1.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2015 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for railcars, locomotives and other equipment as well as real property.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	We also enter into agreements with other railroads and other third parties to operate over certain sections of their track, whereby we pay a per car fee to use the track or make an annual lease payment.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	The costs associated with operating leases are expensed as incurred.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P92_S3	The increase in leased equipment in 2015 was attributable to our acquisition of Freightliner, which primarily relies upon leased railcars and locomotives.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	The number of railcars and locomotives leased by us as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:
1012620_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our operating lease expense for equipment and real property leases and expense for the use of other railroad and other third parties' track for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers and other third parties to operate over various rail lines in North America, with varied expirations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	Revenues from railroads we lease from Class I carriers and other third parties accounted for approximately 7% of our 2015 total revenues.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P95_S3	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 2% of our annual revenues for the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires September 14, 2018), around which time we expect to file a replacement shelf registration statement.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and units.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties (e.g., customers) for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P97_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P97_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that, even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Insurance and Third-Party Claims Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims was $26.6 million and $26.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims at December 31, 2015 included $12.8 million from our North American Operations, $8.1 million from our Australian Operations and $5.7 million from our U.K./European Operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P98_S2	The balance from our North American Operations resulted predominately from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a derailment in Alabama (the Aliceville Derailment) in November 2013 and a trestle fire in Oregon in August 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P98_S3	The balance from our Australian Operations resulted from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with derailments in Australia in 2012.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P98_S4	The balance from our U.K./European Operations resulted primarily from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a rail-related collision in Germany in 2014 that occurred prior to our acquisition of Freightliner.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P98_S5	We received proceeds from insurance totaling $10.4 million , $13.6 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures by segment for the year ending December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015 , there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P100_S3	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	(3) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $12.5 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	(4) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures among our existing operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	(5) Includes deferred compensation of $14.5 million , estimated casualty obligations of $10.3 million , deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Freightliner of $35.7 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $10.2 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P101_S3	In addition, the table includes estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $3.5 million and our 2016 estimated contributions of $13.4 million to our pension plans.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 consisted of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above, as well as credit/payment guarantees acquired from Freightliner.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included within "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses When comparing the effects of average foreign currency exchange rates on operating revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the year ended December 31, 2014 , foreign currency translation had a negative impact on our consolidated operating revenues and a positive impact on our consolidated operating expenses due to the weakening of the Australian and Canadian dollars relative to the United States dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	The following critical accounting policies and use of estimates should be read in conjunction with Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P106_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge's capacity to carry increased loads and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	As a result, we typically incur minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of our capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P108_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	Estimated Useful Life (in Years) Property:
1012620_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	When factors indicate that an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset or asset group in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P113_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P113_S4	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded within deferred items - grants from outside parties, and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P115_S3	Additionally, we review the carrying value of goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	The second step measures the goodwill impairment loss as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P116_S3	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	Impairment losses are expensed when incurred and are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain global liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and other third-party claims associated with our operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P119_S2	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P119_S3	Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $1.0 million per occurrence, except in Australia where our self-insured retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P120_S3	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P120_S4	We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Accruals for claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 20 , Recently Issued Accounting Standards , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM7_P121_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The following table presents principal payments on our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	(1) Includes an A$50.0 million (or $36.4 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2015 ) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 assumed in the acquisition of FreightLink with a carrying value of A$2.7 million (or $1.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2015 ) with an imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using Australia BBR, Canada BA, Euro LIBOR and United States LIBOR (as of December 31, 2015 ).
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	BBR is the Bankers Buyer Rate within Australia, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 2.00% for Australian, Canadian, European and United States borrowings under our credit agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $18.3 million .
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , our foreign subsidiaries had $512.1 million of third-party debt denominated in the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar and Euro.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by our foreign operations and is paid by United States subsidiaries, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S4	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from our United States subsidiaries to our foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S5	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign currency forward purchase contracts.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P3_S6	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	However, cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt may not qualify for hedge accounting.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	In cases where the cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S4	For additional information regarding our Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 9 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S5	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S6	Deferred Consideration On March 25, 2015, as part of the Freightliner acquisition, we recorded a contingent liability within other long-term liabilities of 24.2 million (or $36.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S7	This contingent liability represents the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to us by the Management Shareholders representing an economic interest of approximately 6% on the acquisition date at the Freightliner acquisition price per share, in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest in the future (deferred consideration).
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S8	We will recalculate the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration in each reporting period until it is paid in full by using a contractual formula designed to estimate the economic value of the Management Shareholders' retained interest in a manner consistent with that used to derive the Freightliner acquisition price per share on the acquisition date.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S9	Accordingly, a change in the fair value of the deferred consideration could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which a change in estimate occurs.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S10	As of December 31, 2015 , there was no change in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration (see Note 10 , Fair Value of Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S11	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report), resulting in no change to the contingent liability.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S12	We expect to recognize future changes in the contingent liability for the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration through other expenses within our consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S13	These future changes in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration are not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S14	Each of the Management Shareholders may elect to receive one third of their respective deferred consideration valued as of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P4_S15	Any remaining portion of the deferred consideration will be valued as of March 31, 2020, and paid by the end of 2020.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 8.2% of our total operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that partially offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_16_ITEM7A_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , each one percentage point change in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $1.4 million change in our annual income from operations to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Internal Control Over Financial Reporting On March 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Freightliner.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as appropriate, to include Freightliner's financial position, results of operations and cash flow into our consolidated financial statements from the March 25, 2015 date of acquisition through December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	We are continuing to integrate the acquired operations of Freightliner into our overall internal control over financial reporting and related processes.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Except as disclosed in this paragraph, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company's internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company's Audit Committee.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Consistent with the guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting related to Freightliner.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company acquired Freightliner in a business combination on March 25, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Freightliner's total assets represented 18% of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Freightliner's total revenues and income from operations for the period March 25, 2015 through December 31, 2015 represented 27% and 9% , respectively, of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2015 , we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report, which is included herein under "Part IV.

1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Genesee Wyoming Inc.:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P19_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P20_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P20_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	As described in the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, management has excluded Freightliner Group Limited from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	We have also excluded Freightliner Group Limited from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	Freightliner Group Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 18% and 27%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Unless the context otherwise requires, when used in these consolidated financial statements, the terms "Genesee Wyoming," "G W" and the "Company" refer to Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company owns or leases 120 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in 11 operating regions with 7,500 employees and more than 2,800 customers.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	The financial results of our 11 operating regions are reported in the following three distinct segments:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company's North American Operations segment includes nine operating regions that serve 41 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	This segment includes 113 short line and regional freight railroads with more than 13,000 track-miles.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company's Australian Operations segment provides rail freight services in South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	Included in the Australian Operations segement is the 1,400 -mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line, which is the sole north-south rail carrier outside the coasts and primarily corridor intermodal and commodity freight .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company's U.K./European Operations segment includes the majority of Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner), which the Company acquired in March 2015 (see Note 3 , Changes in Operations ).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	Freightliner is the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and the U.K.'s second-largest rail freight company.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	The Company's U.K./European Operations segment also includes heavy-haul freight operations in Poland and Germany and cross-border intermodal services connecting Northern European seaports with key industrial regions throughout the continent.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	The Company's subsidiaries provide rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , for descriptions of the Company's changes in operations in recent years.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company's railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Revenues from the Company's 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 22% , 24% and 24% of the Company's operating revenues in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	When comparing the Company's results of operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that the Company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shut-downs, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, high winds, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding, among other factors.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	In periods when these events occur, the Company's results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S4	Finally, certain of the Company's railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, global commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, such as steel products, iron ore, paper products and lumber and forest products and agricultural products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S5	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P34_S6	As a result of these and other factors, the Company's results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to the Company's results of operations in other reporting periods.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Genesee Wyoming Inc. and its subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company generates freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail based on a per car, per container or per ton basis.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	Freight revenues are recognized proportionally as shipments move from origin to destination, with related expenses recognized as incurred.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	The Company generates freight-related revenues from port terminal railroad operations and industrial switching (where the Company operates trains on a contract basis in facilities it does not own), as well as demurrage, storage, car hire, track access rights, transloading, crewing services, traction service (or hook and pull service that requires the Company to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customers' train between specified origin and destination points), and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P36_S3	Freight-related revenues are recognized as services are performed or as contractual obligations are fulfilled.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P36_S4	The Company generates all other revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals, railroad construction and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P36_S5	All other revenues are recognized as services are performed or as contractual obligations are fulfilled.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Certain of the countries in which the Company operates have a tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company records these taxes on a net basis.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies consist primarily of purchased items for improvement and maintenance of road property and equipment and are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	Materials and supplies are removed from inventory using the average cost method.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	The Company accounts for businesses it acquires using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company records the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	As part of this process, the Company identifies and attributes values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P41_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P41_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P41_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business's acquisition date.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P42_S2	The Company incurs maintenance and repair expenses to keep its operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P42_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, the Company does not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, the Company's short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	As a result, the Company typically incurs minimal spending on self-constructed assets and, instead, the vast majority of its capital spending relates to purchased assets installed by professional contractors.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	In addition, the Company generally does not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P44_S3	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company depreciates its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of the Company's major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company reviews its long-lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S1	When factors indicate that an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset or asset group in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S2	If impairment is identified, a loss would be reported to the extent that the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the fair value of those assets as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S3	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S4	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S5	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S6	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, the Company records the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P46_S7	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company reviews the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	The Company performs its annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , as a result of our annual impairment test.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P47_S3	Additionally, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	The second step measures the goodwill impairment loss as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P48_S3	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Impairment losses are expensed when incurred and are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets The Company performs an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company has amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as operational network rights, service agreements, customer contracts or relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S3	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims The Company maintains global liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S4	The Company's liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and other third-party claims associated with the Company's operations.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S5	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under the liability policies.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P51_S6	The Company's liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company's property policies cover property and equipment that the Company owns, as well as property in the Company's care, custody and control.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company's property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $1.0 million per occurrence, except in Australia where the Company's self-insured retention for property damage due to a cyclone or flood is A$2.5 million .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S3	The self-insured retentions under the policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on the Company's loss history, the size and make-up of the Company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S4	The Company also maintains ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors' and officers' liability, workers' compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S5	Accruals for claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P52_S6	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of its United States subsidiaries.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	Each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P53_S3	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company evaluates on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (Compensation Committee) has discretion to determine grantees, grant dates, amounts of grants, vesting and expiration dates for stock-based compensation awarded to the Company's employees under the Company's Third Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Omnibus Plan permits the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the Compensation Committee, in each case consistent with the Omnibus Plan's purpose.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	Under the terms of the awards, equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective remaining terms as directors.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P56_S3	The grant date fair value of non-vested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P56_S4	The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Two assumptions in the Black-Scholes pricing model require management judgment: the life of the option and the volatility of the stock price over the life of the option.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The assumption for the life of the option is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	The assumption for the volatility of the stock is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The fair value of the Company's restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	The grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period of the grant.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Three assumptions in the Monte Carlo simulation model require management judgment: volatility of the Company's Class A Common Stock, volatility of the stock of the members of the two peer groups and the correlation coefficients between the Company's stock price and the stock price of the peer groups.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	The correlation coefficients are calculated based upon the historical price data used to calculate the volatilities.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the following three-level hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable market data.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are prepared in the local currency of the respective subsidiary and translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average rate for the period.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Currency translation adjustments are reflected within the equity section of the balance sheet and are included in other comprehensive income.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	Upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying investment in the foreign subsidiary, cumulative translation adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	Significant estimates using management judgment are made in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P66_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P66_S3	Risks and Uncertainties Slower growth, an economic recession, significant changes in commodity prices or regulation that affects the countries where the Company operates or their imports and exports could negatively impact the Company's business.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P66_S4	The Company is required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that the respective asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P66_S5	A decline in current macroeconomic or financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Europe Freightliner Group Limited: On March 25, 2015 , the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner) , pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	Certain former management shareholders of Freightliner (Management Shareholders) retained an approximate 6% economic interest in Freightliner in the form of deferred consideration.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	The Company expects to settle the deferred consideration by the end of 2020.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Headquartered in London, England, Freightliner is an international freight rail operator with operations in the U.K., Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Freightliner's principal business is located in the U.K., where it is the largest maritime intermodal operator and the second largest freight rail operator, providing service throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	In Continental Europe, Freightliner Poland primarily serves aggregates and coal customers in Poland.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P68_S3	In addition, Freightliner's ERS subsidiary, based in Rotterdam, provides cross-border intermodal services connecting the northern European ports of Rotterdam, Bremerhaven and Hamburg to key cities in Germany, Poland, Italy and beyond.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	In Australia, Freightliner currently transports coal and containerized agricultural products for its customers in New South Wales.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	As of the acquisition date, Freightliner employed approximately 2,500 people worldwide and had a fleet of primarily leased equipment of approximately 250 standard gauge locomotives, including approximately 45 electric locomotives, and 5,500 railcars.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	The Company funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Company's Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Syndicated Credit Facility Agreement, as amended (the Credit Agreement) (see Note 8 , Long-Term Debt ) and available cash.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P70_S2	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the total consideration to United States dollars was $1.49 for one British pound (GBP), the exchange rate on March 25, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P70_S3	The calculation of the total consideration for the Freightliner acquisition is presented below (amounts in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	As of March 25, 2015, the Company recorded a contingent liability within other long-term liabilities of 24.2 million (or $36.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	This contingent liability represents the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to the Company by the Management Shareholders representing an economic interest of approximately 6% on the acquisition date at the Freightliner acquisition price per share, in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest in the future (deferred consideration).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	The Company will recalculate the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration in each reporting period until it is paid in full by using a contractual formula designed to estimate the economic value of the Management Shareholders' retained interest in a manner consistent with that used to derive the Freightliner acquisition price per share on the acquisition date.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P71_S3	Accordingly, a change in the fair value of the deferred consideration could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations for the period in which a change in estimate occurs.

1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The Company actively monitors its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and uses derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of these risks.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S1	The Company uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S2	The Company does not trade or use derivative instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone, nor does the Company use derivative instruments where it does not have underlying exposures.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S3	Complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S4	The Company manages its hedging position and monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S5	Management believes its use of derivative instruments to manage risk is in the Company's best interest.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S6	However, the Company's use of derivative financial instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P151_S7	The Company's instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, net, accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	The Company may designate derivatives as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a hedge of the variability of the cash flows to be received or paid in the future related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P152_S1	The portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative used as a cash flow hedge that is offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the effective portion) is recorded in other comprehensive income.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P152_S2	As the hedged item is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) is reported in the consolidated statements of operations on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P152_S3	The portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges that is not offset by changes in the expected cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability (the ineffective portion) is immediately recognized in earnings on the same line item as the hedged item.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	The Company matches the hedge instrument to the underlying hedged item (assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P153_S1	At inception of the hedge and at least quarterly thereafter, the Company assesses whether the derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P153_S2	When it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument thereafter are recognized in earnings during the period in which it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P154_S0	From time to time, the Company may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P154_S1	For example, to mitigate currency exposures related to intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P154_S2	The Company believes such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P155_S0	The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to the changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P155_S1	These swap agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P155_S2	Changes in the fair value of the swap agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive income, based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the future interest payments attributable to the underlying portion of the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P155_S3	Interest payments accrued each reporting period for these interest rate swaps are recognized in interest expense.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of the Company's outstanding interest rate swap agreements entered into to manage the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	On November 9, 2012, the Company entered into multiple 10-year forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates on the Company's variable rate debt.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P157_S1	It remains probable that the Company will either issue $300.0 million of fixed-rate debt or have $300.0 million of variable-rate debt under the Company's commercial banking lines.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P157_S2	The forward starting interest rate swap agreements are expected to settle in cash on September 30, 2016 .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P157_S3	The Company expects any gains or losses on settlement will be amortized over the life of the respective swaps.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P157_S4	The following table summarizes the Company's interest rate swap agreements that expired during 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	The fair values of the Company's interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P159_S0	The Company's effectiveness testing during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings due to ineffectiveness.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P160_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , existing net losses associated with the Company's interest rate swaps of $2.9 million , $2.4 million and $4.1 million , respectively, were realized and recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P160_S1	Based on the fair value of these interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2015 , the Company expects to reclassify $0.8 million of net losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings within the next 12 months.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P160_S2	See Note 16 , Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) , for additional information regarding the Company's cash flow hedges.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's foreign subsidiaries had $512.1 million of third-party debt denominated in the local currencies in which the Company's foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of the Company's debt service payments is limited.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by the Company's foreign subsidiaries and is paid by United States subsidiaries, the Company may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from the Company's United States subsidiaries to its foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S5	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward purchase contracts.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P161_S6	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P162_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P162_S1	However, cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt may not qualify for hedge accounting.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P162_S2	In cases where the cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company believes that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P162_S3	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	On February 25, 2015, the Company announced its entry into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of Freightliner, for cash consideration of approximately 490 million (or approximately $755 million at the exchange rate on February 25, 2015).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	Shortly after the announcement of the acquisition, the Company entered into British pound forward purchase contracts to fix 307.1 million of the purchase price to US$475.0 million and 84.7 million of the purchase price to A$163.8 million .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	The subsequent decrease in value of the British pound versus the United States and Australian dollars between the dates the British pound forward purchase contracts were entered into and March 23, 2015, the date that the 391.8 million in funds were delivered, resulted in a loss on settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts of $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P164_S0	On March 25, 2015, the Company closed on the Freightliner transaction and paid cash consideration for the acquisition of 492.1 million (or $733.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P164_S1	The Company financed the acquisition through a combination of available cash and borrowings under the Company's Credit Agreement.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P164_S2	A portion of the funds was transferred from the United States to the U.K. through an intercompany loan with a notional amount of 120.0 million (or $181.0 million at the exchange rate on the effective date of the loan) and accrued interest as of December 31, 2015 of 5.8 million (or $8.5 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2015 ), each of which are expected to remain until maturity of the loan.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P164_S3	To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to this non-functional currency intercompany loan and the related interest, the Company entered into British pound forward contracts, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P164_S4	The fair values of the Company's British pound forward contracts were estimated based on Level 2 inputs.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P165_S0	The Company's effectiveness testing during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted in no amount of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings due to ineffectiveness.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P165_S1	The following table summarizes the Company's outstanding British pound forward contracts (British pounds in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S0	On December 3, 2012, the Company entered into two Australian dollar/United States dollar floating to floating cross-currency swap agreements (the Swaps), to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to a non-functional currency intercompany loan between the United States and Australian entities, originally set to expire on December 1, 2014, which did not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S1	On May 23, 2014, the intercompany loan was repaid and the Company terminated the Swaps.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S2	In connection with the termination, the Company paid A$105 million and received $108.9 million .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S3	The Swaps required the Company to pay Australian dollar BBSW plus 3.25% based on a notional amount of A$105.0 million and allowed the Company to receive United States LIBOR plus 2.82% based on a notional amount of $109.6 million on a quarterly basis.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S4	As a result of the quarterly net settlement payments, the Company realized a net expense of $1.2 million within interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S5	In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Company recognized a net expense of $0.1 million , within other income, net related to the settlement of the derivative agreement and the mark-to-market of the underlying intercompany debt instrument to the exchange rate.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P166_S6	The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company's derivative instruments recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P167_S0	The following table shows the effect of the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	The following table shows the effect of the Company's derivative instruments not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in the consolidated statements of operations (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument held by the Company:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	Derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	During the reporting period, the Company's derivative financial instruments consisted of interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward contracts.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P171_S2	The Company estimated the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including fixed interest rates, LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P171_S3	The Company estimated the fair value of its British pound forward contracts based on Level 2 valuation inputs, including LIBOR implied forward interest rates, British pound LIBOR implied forward interest rates and the remaining time to maturity.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	The Company's recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) relate solely to the Company's deferred consideration from the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	The fair value of the deferred consideration liability, which equals the representative share value on the acquisition date, was estimated by discounting, to present value, contingent payments expected to be made (see Note 3 , Changes in Operations ).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	The following table presents the Company's financial instruments that are carried at fair value using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	The following table presents the Company's financial instrument carried at fair value using Level 3 inputs as of December 31, 2015 (amounts in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The Company's recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) relate solely to the Company's deferred consideration from the Freightliner acquisition (see Note 3 , Changes in Operations ).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P175_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , there was no change in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration resulting in no change to the contingent liability.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P175_S2	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value using Level 2 inputs of the Company's financial instruments carried at historical cost at December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Freightliner, the Company assumed a defined benefit pension plan for its U.K. employees through a standalone shared cost arrangement within the Railways Pension Scheme (Pension Program).
1012620_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	The Pension Program is managed and administered by a professional pension administration company and is overseen by trustees with professional advice from independent actuaries and other advisers.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P176_S2	The Pension Program is a shared cost arrangement with required contributions shared between Freightliner and its employees with Freightliner contributing 60% and the remaining 40% contributed by active employees.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P176_S3	The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to the Pension Program subject to the assumptions that the Company selects.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The following table summarizes the funding obligations and assets of the Pension Program as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	The following table presents the changes in the Company's portion of the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of the Pension Program since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date for the year ended December 31, 2015 and funded status as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The following table presents the amounts recognized for the Pension Program in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and in other comprehensive income/(loss) since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date for the year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	The following table summarizes the components of the Pension Program related to the net benefit costs recognized in labor and benefits in the Company's consolidated statement of operations since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date for the year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	The following table presents the actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status of the Pension Program as of December 31, 2015 and for the calculation of net periodic pension expense associated with the Pension Program since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date for the year ended December 31, 2015 :
1012620_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The discount rates used by the actuaries are established by considering the yields on high quality corporate bonds having a similar duration as the expected liabilities under the Pension Program.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	As of December 31, 2015, each one percentage point change in the discount rate would result in a $69.3 million change in the pension liability.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	In addition, each one percentage point change in the retail price index (RPI) would result in a $69.3 million change in the pension liability.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	The assets of the Pension Program are held in a separate trustee administered fund operated by Railways Trustee Company Limited.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P183_S1	The trustee is responsible for ensuring that investment strategies are in compliance with the Pension Program.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	The assets are invested through a number of pooled investment funds, each with a different risk and return profile.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P184_S1	Only railways pension programs may invest in these pooled funds.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P184_S2	Each railways pension program holds units in some or all of the pooled funds.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P184_S3	The use of these pools enables each railways pension program to hold a broader range of investments more efficiently than may have been possible through direct ownership.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Pension Program's asset allocation policy states the assets should be allocated as follows:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	The expected return on assets represents the weighted average of long-term expected yields of the pooled investment funds.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P186_S1	The expected returns on these pooled funds are not readily determinable from quoted market prices.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P186_S2	However, the funds are actively managed by the trustee to achieve benchmark returns.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P186_S3	Accordingly, the expected return for each pooled investment fund for purposes of the actuarial calculations was estimated using the respective pooled fund's benchmark return relative to the RPI.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P186_S4	The following table provides the Pension Program's allocation of assets among the pooled investment funds and the expected return on assets for each pooled fund, net of expenses, as well as the weighted average expected return on assets used in the actuarial calculations as of December 31, 2015:
1012620_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the major categories of the Pension Program's assets segregated according to the hierarchy of valuation inputs for measuring fair value (see Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies ) as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	The growth pooled fund is comprised of global equities, emerging market bonds and hedge funds.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	Fair value is measured using the net asset value per share.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P190_S0	(b) The private equity pooled fund is comprised of a series of sub funds, each representing a different vintage of private equity investment.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P191_S0	Fair value is measured using the net asset value per share.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P192_S0	(c) The government bond pooled fund is comprised of government debt for developed markets, global investment grade corporate bonds and the non-government bond pooled fund.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P193_S0	Fair value is measured using the net asset value per share.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P194_S0	(d) Infrastructure pooled fund is comprised of investments in facilities, structures and services required to facilitate the orderly operation of the economy.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P195_S0	Fair value is measured using the net asset value per share.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P195_S1	The Company expects to contribute $12.7 million to the Pension Program for the period ending December 31, 2016 .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P196_S0	The Pension Program's assets may undergo significant changes over time as a result of market conditions.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P196_S1	In the event that the Pension Program's projected assets and liabilities reveal additional funding requirements, the shared cost arrangement generally means that the Company will be required to pay 60% of any additional contributions, with active members contributing the remaining 40% , in each case over an agreed recovery period.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P196_S2	If the Pension Program was to be terminated and wound up, any deficit would fall entirely on the Company and would not be shared with active members.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P196_S3	Currently, the Company has no intention of terminating the Pension Program.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P196_S4	The following benefit payments are expected to be paid between 2016 and 2025 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and includes the specific steps for recognizing revenue and disclosure requirements.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P249_S1	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P249_S2	The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P249_S3	The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

1012620_16_ITEM15_P250_S1	This guidance should be applied either prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P250_S2	The amendments in this guidance are effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P250_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1012620_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, which advises that in regards to line-of-credit arrangements, the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.
1012620_16_ITEM15_P254_S1	Reclassifying the presentation of debt issuance costs is expected to decrease the Company's total assets by less than 1% and decrease total debt by approximately 1% .
1012620_16_ITEM15_P255_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position.

1012620_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	We own or lease 122 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in 10 operating regions with approximately 7,300 employees and 3,000 customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our eight North American regions serve 41 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces and include 115 short line and regional freight railroads with more than 13,000 track-miles.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our Australia Region provides rail freight services in New South Wales, including in the Hunter Valley coal supply chain, the Northern Territory and South Australia, including operating the 1,400 -mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of December 1, 2016, G W's Australia Region is 51.1% owned by us and 48.9% owned by a consortium of funds and clients managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our U.K./Europe Region is led by Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner), the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and second-largest rail freight company.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Operations also include heavy-haul in Poland and Germany and cross-border intermodal services connecting Northern European seaports with key industrial regions throughout the continent.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our subsidiaries provide rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	GROWTH STRATEGY Since our initial public offering in 1996, our revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 17.6% , from $77.8 million in 1996 to $2.0 billion in 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Over the same period, our stock price has increased at a compound growth rate of 15.3%, from $3.75 on June 25, 1996, adjusted for stock splits, to $69.41 on December 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, which has two main drivers: (1) our operating strategy; and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Most recently, in November 2016, we acquired Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W), a Class III regional freight railroad operating in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Pty Limited (GRail), the third largest coal haulage business in Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	In addition, in December 2016, we announced that we entered into an agreement to purchase Pentalver Transport Limited (Pentalver), a U.K.-based maritime container terminal and transportation business.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	We expect the Pentalver acquisition to close in the second quarter of 2017, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Changes in Operations for more information on the P W, GRail and Pentalver acquisitions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our railroads operate under strong regional management teams, supported by centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , our operations were organized in 10 geographic regions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	In North America, we have eight regions: Central, Coastal (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Midwest, Mountain West (which includes industrial switching operations), Northeast, Pacific, Southern and Canada.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	Outside North America, we have two regions: Australia (which is 51.1% owned by us through the Australia Partnership) and U.K./Europe (which consists of operations in the U.K., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, as well as the provision of management and technical support through Freightliner to Saudi Arabia Railway Company).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge, customer service and safety culture that we view as critical to achieving our financial goals.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our regional managers focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following five principal elements:
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business and that the attention to detail necessary to eliminate employee injuries translates into efficient, well-run operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	To monitor our safety performance, we apply the guidelines established by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to all of our operations worldwide.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	In 2016 , our operations achieved a consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate of 0.73 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S4	Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 63% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S5	For comparative purposes, from January 2016 through November 2016 , the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average reportable injury frequency rate was 2.72 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 2.89 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S6	Based on these results, in 2016 , our operations were approximately four times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages and safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S7	Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we monitor our reportable derailments worldwide in accordance with the guidelines established by the FRA.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P8_S8	Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable derailment frequency rate, defined as FRA reportable derailments per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.52 and 0.66 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers, and each of our local railroads is focused on exceeding customer expectations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	This customer commitment supports not only traffic growth, but also customer loyalty and new business development opportunities.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	To ensure the needs of our customers are addressed promptly, we employ technology-based service exception tools to monitor service information, communicate issues and track corrective actions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We engage a leading independent customer-satisfaction research firm to conduct a biennial, comprehensive customer satisfaction survey.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The survey results are used to measure our performance and develop continuous improvement programs.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	Over the past eight years, we have outscored the trucking and railroad industries on each of our biennial customer satisfaction surveys.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We generally build and operate each of our regions based on the local customer base within our operating geographies and seek to grow rail traffic through intensive marketing efforts to new and existing customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) in 2012, Freightliner in 2015 and GRail in 2016, we believe that our expanded North American, European and Australian footprint provides us with greater visibility of new commercial and industrial development opportunities in these geographies that should help increase the success of our marketing efforts.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Further, we believe that our relationship with MIRA, a recognized Australian infrastructure investor, will enable us to leverage our rail platform for future growth opportunities in Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also pursue additional sources of revenue by providing ancillary rail services such as railcar switching, rolling-stock and shipping container repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enables our customers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	Separately, in Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, where there are open access regimes in the various countries in which we operate, we compete for new business opportunities at most locations on the open access rail networks.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We focus on running cost effective railroad operations and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated prior to our acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead through our regional structure, consolidating equipment and in-sourcing track maintenance, reducing transportation costs, selling surplus assets and reducing expenses associated with accidents and personal injuries through the implementation of our safety culture.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	At the same time, we seek to improve our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for our traffic type and density.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	Further, in 2015, we formed a new entity, Railroad Engineering Services LLC, with experienced management and dedicated track engineering resources to enhance the productivity and cost efficiency of our track and bridge capital programs.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	In addition, because of the importance of certain of our customers and railroads to their regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track and other infrastructure.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S5	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S6	To assist our local management teams, we provide administrative, commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from scale efficiencies and centralized expertise.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S7	Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I railroad relationship management.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S8	Our operations department assists with implementing our safety culture, conducting training programs, leveraging our scale in purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, ensuring efficient equipment utilization and service design, and providing mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S9	In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S10	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S11	Since 2000, we have added 104 railroads through the execution of our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P13_S12	Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:
1012620_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Acquisitions of additional short line and regional railroads in the United States and Canada, such as the P W acquisition on November 1, 2016 and our acquisitions of Pinsly Railroad Company's (Pinsly) Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) in January 2015, RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company (AZER) in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Acquisitions of international railroads, such as our acquisitions of London-based Freightliner in 2015, FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia in 2010 and Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V. (RRF) in the Netherlands in 2008.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Acquisitions of operations from industrial or mining companies, such as our acquisitions of GRail from Glencore Coal Pty Limited in Australia on December 1, 2016 and the railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 2003.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	When we make acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and reduce costs wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead costs, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans, more efficient equipment utilization and enhanced customer service and marketing initiatives.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	In some cases, however, the best way to maximize the value of an investment is to increase expenditures at a new acquisition, such as for track upgrades, in order to improve customer satisfaction and drive additional revenue growth.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	In North America, we believe that our footprint of railroads provides opportunities to make contiguous short line railroad acquisitions due to a higher number of touchpoints with other railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	On a global basis, we believe that our scale, international experience and financial resources enhance our ability to compete for rail opportunities worldwide.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	We have made a number of important railroad investments in North America and in various international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	According to the AAR's 2016 Railroad Facts Book, there were 574 freight railroads in the United States operating over 138,400 miles of track.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	As described in the table below, the AAR classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation) and track miles operated.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	The following table shows the breakdown of freight railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	(1) CSX Corp, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern Corp., Kansas City Southern Railway Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density and intercity traffic lanes.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The primary function of the regional and local railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I railroad networks.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We refer to local railroads as short line railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Typically, local, or short line, railroads serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Short line railroads generally have more predictable and straightforward operations as they largely perform point-to-point, light density service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the Class I railroads or larger regional railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	A significant portion of regional and short line railroad traffic is driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	For example, a Class I railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold or leased branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	Divestiture of branch lines spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry and enabled Class I railroads to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We operate two regional and 105 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 15,500 miles of track.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	According to Rail Trends 2014, published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are approximately 27,270 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Similar to the United States railroad industry, freight railroads in Canada are also categorized as Class I railroads, regional railroads and short line railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	In Canada, there are two Class I railroads that are largely transcontinental carriers in Canada, with significant United States operations as well, several regional operators and approximately 50 short line railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	We operate eight local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,500 miles of track.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Australian Operations Australia has approximately 25,000 miles ( 40,000 kilometers (km)) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers and also connects key mining regions to ports.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, narrow and standard gauge.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Australian rail freight transport industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	The access rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Australian rail freight transport industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track that they own or lease.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	We are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland Australian states and in the Northern Territory.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Since Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition on their above rail business from other rail carriers, as well as from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	The open access nature of the Australian rail freight transport industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	However, shipments of bulk commodities in Australia are generally handled under long-term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take-or-pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator difficult.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,300 miles ( 3,700 km) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles ( 2,200 km) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054, as well as approximately 900 miles ( 1,500 km) of track in South Australia that we manage pursuant to a lease that expires in 2047.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Through the concession and lease agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	In South Australia and the Northern Territory, our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad despite the open access environment.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	In addition, through our acquisitions of Freightliner and GRail, we also have above rail operations in New South Wales.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	According to Network Rail, the authority responsible for Great Britain s railway network, there are approximately 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of track owned and managed by it, and there are seven rail operators licensed for freight transport in Great Britain.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Great Britain s rail network is also open access, which means rail lines can be utilized by any licensed rail operator with an appropriate track access agreement in place.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	In the U.K.'s open access framework, the infrastructure managers must provide access to the rail infrastructure to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	As a result, U.K. rail freight customers have access to multiple rail carriers under the open access regime, and our operations face competition from both other rail freight carriers and other modes of transportation, such as road and water.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	In Great Britain in 2015, 9% of all freight goods were moved by rail, while over the same period, 76% and 15% of goods were moved via road and water, respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	Through our acquisition of Freightliner, we are the largest rail participant in the U.K. intermodal market (deep sea maritime containers), and when combined with Freightliner's bulk haulage operations, including coal, aggregates, cement and infrastructure services, we are the second largest rail freight company in the U.K.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	Through our recently announced acquisition of Pentalver, which we expect will close in the second quarter of 2017, we will operate off-dock container terminals (most under long-term lease) strategically placed at each of the four major seaports of Felixstowe, Southampton, London Gateway and Tilbury, as well as an inland terminal located at Cannock, in the U.K. Midlands, near many of the nation s largest distribution centers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	In addition to providing storage for loaded and empty containers on over 100 acres of land, Pentalver also operates a trucking haulage service with more than 150 trucks, primarily providing daily service between the seaports of Felixstowe and Southampton and its inland terminal at Cannock.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	Pentalver also provides services related to container maintenance and repair (including refrigerated containers) and is one of the largest sellers of new and used containers in the U.K.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	The logistics of maritime container transportation in the U.K. are highly competitive, whether by road, rail or short-sea, with a premium placed on timely, efficient and safe service.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	We expect that the Pentalver acquisition will enable G W to (i) enhance its U.K. services by providing rail and road transportation solutions, as well as offering storage options at the ports and inland, and (ii) unlock efficiencies from shared services and enhanced asset utilization from Pentalver s trucking fleet and Freightliner s existing fleet of approximately 250 trucks that currently provide local collection and delivery haulage from Freightliner s inland terminals.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,241 miles ( 3,607 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Belgian rail network, and currently there are 12 rail operators licensed for freight transport in Belgium.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	In Belgium, our subsidiary, Belgium Rail Feeding, operates mainly in the Port of Antwerp and on the main corridors towards the Netherlands and German boarders.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Germany The German rail network is composed of approximately 20,630 miles ( 33,193 km) of track.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	There are approximately 385 rail operators certified for freight transport in Germany.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	In Germany, as well as in other Continental European markets, the leading rail freight operators are often state controlled, such as DB Schenker in Germany.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P43_S3	As a result of Germany's open access regime, the rail infrastructure may be accessed by any licensed rail operator.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	A number of our subsidiaries operate in Germany.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	ERS Railways B.V. (ERS) operates intermodal routes from the Ports of Hamburg and Bremerhaven, among others.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	o. (Freightliner Poland) operates on the open access rail system within Germany with cross-border traffic into Poland.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	RRF provides short-line rail services on the main corridors in Germany, and Freightliner DE GmbH (Freightliner Germany) operates on the open access rail system within Germany with cross-border traffic into Poland.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,363 miles ( 7,021 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	As a result of the open access regime in the Netherlands, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	According to the trade association Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are 21 rail operators that provide rail freight services in the Netherlands.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	In the Netherlands, our subsidiary, RRF, operates mainly in the Port of Rotterdam and on the main corridors towards the German and Belgian borders.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our subsidiary, ERS, operates intermodal routes from the Port of Rotterdam.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	According to the Office of Rail Transport, the railways regulator in Poland, there are approximately 94 rail operators certified for freight transport in Poland operating over approximately 11,500 miles ( 18,510 km) of track.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	As a result of Poland s open access regime, this rail infrastructure may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	In Poland, our subsidiary, Freightliner Poland, operates on the open access rail system within Poland with some cross-border traffic into other neighboring countries.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	OPERATIONS Through our subsidiaries, we own or lease 122 freight railroads worldwide, including 105 short line railroads and two regional freight railroads in the United States, eight short line railroads in Canada, three railroads in Australia, one in the U.K., one in Poland and Germany and two in the Netherlands.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our subsidiaries provide rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our railroads operate over approximately 15,900 miles of track that are owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over approximately 6,200 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Freight Revenues We generate freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Freight revenues represented 68.5% , 70.0% and 76.4% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , see the discussion under "Part II Item 7.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized either as interline or local traffic.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Interline traffic passes over the lines of two or more rail carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	It can originate or terminate with customers located along a rail line, or it can pass over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the traffic originating or terminating on the rail line (referred to as overhead traffic).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	Unlike overhead traffic, originating, terminating and local traffic in North America provides us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P53_S4	In 2016 , revenues generated from originating, terminating and local traffic in North America constituted approximately 93% of our North American freight revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, railroads generally serve from origin to destination with few, if any, interline movements.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Freight-Related Revenues We generate freight-related revenues primarily from port terminal railroad operations and industrial switching (where we operate trains on a contract basis in facilities we do not own), as well as demurrage, storage, car hire, track access rights, transloading, crewing services, traction service (or hook and pull service that requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customers' train between specified origin and destination points) and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Freight-related revenues represented 26.8% , 25.1% and 17.7% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	All Other Revenues We generate all other revenues primarily from revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals, railroad construction and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	All other revenues represented 4.7% , 4.9% and 5.9% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Seasonality of Operations Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or its demand cycle.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	For instance, certain agricultural and food products, such as winter wheat in Canada, ship only during certain months each year.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	In addition, our Australian and U.K./European intermodal businesses have peak seasons late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter of each year.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations as a result of weather patterns.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	See Note 19 , Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited) , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products, such as construction materials.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	In addition, due to adverse winter conditions, we may also experience reduced shipments as a result of weather-related network disruptions and also tend to incur higher operating costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season (i.e., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	Segment and Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our segments and geographic areas, see Note 18 , Segment and Geographic Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	Customers As of December 31, 2016 , our operations served approximately 3,000 customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S5	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 22% , 22% and 24% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S6	Two of our 10 largest customers in 2016 were located in Australia, one of which operates in the iron ore mining sector and the other of which operates in the agricultural and coal sectors.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P59_S7	Two of our 10 largest customers in 2016 were located in the U.K., one of which is a maritime shipping company and the other of which is an infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in England, Scotland and Wales.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms generally ranging from less than one year to 10 years.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Generally, our freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	These contracts generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion based upon the invested capital associated with the freight movement and the variable portion based on the actual volumes shipped.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	In the U.K. and Continental Europe, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us and the customer.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration from one to 12 years in the U.K. and one to two years in Poland.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	These contracts establish a price or a methodology to calculate the price.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P62_S3	In some cases, the contracts provide for a minimum volume commitment by the customer and certain business is also conducted on a spot basis.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P62_S4	Our contracts will typically provide for a price adjustment to reflect any changes to particular elements of our cost base, such as fuel and track access charges.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P62_S5	In addition, Freightliner, as part of a British consortium, provides management and technical support for infrastructure and freight operations to Saudi Railway Company, a government-owned company established in 2006 and tasked with developing and operating railway services, pursuant to a contract that expires in 2020.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Employees There are various labor laws governing the countries in which we operate.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately 7,300 full-time employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	Of this total, approximately 4,100 employees were union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Our operations have 97 labor agreements with unions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P63_S4	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to 29 of those agreements and are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements with three newly represented bargaining units.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P63_S5	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 33 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	In Australia, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	In the U.K., we have collective bargaining agreements with four recognized unions covering the majority of our employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	In Continental Europe, we have one collective bargaining agreement in Belgium, and other key locations have local work councils.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	We believe that we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	The following table sets forth an approximation of union and non-union employees as of the year ended December 31, 2016 :
1012620_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	(a) Also includes employees that have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of train accidents and personal injuries.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our safety program was implemented across the Freightliner group of companies following our acquisition in March 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S3	In order to continuously improve our safety results, we utilize and measure various safety metrics, such as human factor incidents, that are instrumental in reducing our FRA reportable injuries.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S4	To monitor our safety performance, we apply the guidelines established by the FRA to all of our operations worldwide.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S5	Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable injury frequency rate, as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.73 and 1.07 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which included our Freightliner operations that were acquired in March of 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P67_S6	Following the guidelines set out by the FRA, Freightliner's consolidated reportable injury frequency rate was 1.06 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2.11 for the period from March 25, 2015 through December 31, 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Freightliner has made significant progress in integrating the G W safety culture into its operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads was 2.72 in 2016 (through November) and 2.84 in 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	Based on these results, in 2016 , our operations were approximately four times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages and safer than any United States Class I railroad.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we monitor our reportable derailments worldwide in accordance with the guidelines established by the FRA.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S4	Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable derailment frequency rate, defined as FRA reportable derailments per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.52 and 0.66 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S5	Further, we continue to utilize technology to analyze our track so as to prevent track-caused derailments.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S6	In addition, our information technology staff routinely assesses the security of our computer networks from cyber attacks.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P68_S7	To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions of our networks or operations due to cyber attacks.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our employees also strive to heighten awareness of rail safety in the communities where we operate through participation in governmental and industry sponsored safety programs, such as Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit organization that provides public education programs to prevent collisions, injuries and fatalities on and around railroad tracks and highway-rail grade crossings.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	During 2016 , employees of our railroads made approximately 529 Operation Lifesaver presentations focused on the dangers associated with highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad property.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	We also participate in safety committees of the AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	INSURANCE We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and other third-party claims associated with our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P70_S3	Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The self-insured retentions under our insurance policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	COMPETITION Railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes and for certain commodities, ships, barges and pipelines.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	In North America, there normally is only one rail carrier directly serving a customer on its line, while most freight is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes, so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	To a lesser degree, we also face competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P75_S3	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	We also face import competition, where commodities we transport face competition from less expensive imported products (e.g., steel).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	In addition, some of the products we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis (e.g., grain).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P76_S3	In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including infrastructure and private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P76_S4	Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller's assessment of the buyer's railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P76_S5	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and long-term operator of rail properties, our managerial and financial resources, as well as our commitment to safety and the communities in which we operate, position us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	REGULATION North American Operations United States In addition to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_17_ITEM1_P79_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P79_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	The FRA, DOT, OSHA and PHMSA have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, which include the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and railcar inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and may regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P80_S3	In 2016 , the STB continued various proceedings on whether to expand rail regulation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P80_S4	The STB continues to evaluate the impact of "access" regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure and has held hearings to assess the impact of changes to the access regime in the United States.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	During the past several legislative sessions, bills have been introduced in Congress that would expand the regulatory authority of the STB and could include new antitrust provisions that alter the regulatory structure of the railroad industry.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	Additionally, a DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits commenced in 2012.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P81_S2	The results of the DOT study were released in 2015, but data limitations in the study continue to hinder any near term changes to the federal truck size and weight limits.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P81_S3	The majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, we continue to monitor these initiatives.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P81_S4	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	In 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which, following the passage by Congress of an extension in October 2015, generally is to be completed as early as December 31, 2018.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P82_S2	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P82_S3	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads are required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P82_S4	Our procurement and implementation of required PTC equipment is underway, and we do not expect that our compliance with these PTC requirements will give rise to any material financial expenditures.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P82_S5	However, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	Canada Railroads that operate in more than one province are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules and the jurisdiction of the federal government.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec), Ottawa Valley Railway, Southern Ontario Railway, Knob Lake Timmins Railway and the Goderich-Exeter Railway are federally regulated railroads in Canada that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S2	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S3	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S4	Railways operating exclusively within one province are regulated by that province and must hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by the appropriate provincial authority.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S5	Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S6	In addition, Huron Central Railway is subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P83_S7	Generally, construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated by the provincial authorities, as are railway services.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P84_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada's Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	In 2015 and 2016, the Canadian Minister of Transport adopted enhanced rules concerning the transportation of crude oil and other dangerous goods, amending the Canada Transportation Act, the Railway Safety Act and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, as well as associated regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	While certain of the new rules are not yet applicable, the enhanced rules include mandatory insurance requirements, with insurance levels established based on the nature of the commodities being moved on a railway line as well as a per ton levy on the transportation of crude oil and other designated goods by a railway company.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P85_S2	In addition, all federally regulated railway companies and local railway companies were required to obtain a Railway Operating Certificate before January 1, 2017 in order to operate in Canada.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P85_S3	All necessary applications for Railway Operating Certificates were obtained for our Canadian railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	Australian Operations In Australia, we are subject to multiple regulatory regimes governing workplace health and safety, as well as rail safety, in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	Regulation of rail safety is predominately governed by national legislation and administered by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator, except in Queensland where the Regulator is the Department of Transport and Main Roads.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	Queensland is expected to join the national regulator in 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	Regulation of track access to nationally significant rail infrastructure is generally governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	The state access regimes are required to be certified as effective access regimes by the Australian National Competition Council.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	The regulatory oversight for the provision of rail infrastructure access is provided by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P87_S3	In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board based on Australian national interest considerations and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on competition considerations.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	U.K./European Operations In the European Union (EU), several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	These directives generally cover the development of railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P88_S2	The EU legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P88_S3	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network, and EU Member States must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P88_S4	These directives have been or will be implemented in legislation passed in each of the European countries in which we operate.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	Operations segment is a member of the EU, and each one has adopted a similar regulatory regime consistent with European legislation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	EU law requires each member state to establish an overarching regulatory body for rail, independent in its organization, legal structure, funding and decision making that is also independent from any infrastructure manager.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P89_S2	The regulatory body ensures fair and non-discriminatory access to the rail infrastructure network and will often be responsible for monitoring competition in the rail services market, the licensing of rail operators and rail safety.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently, and any other bilateral trade agreements the U.K. can reach with other trade partners, as well as any changes to the regulation of rail.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	The rail infrastructure is owned and managed by the infrastructure manager who is responsible for maintaining and renewing the infrastructure as well as enhancements to the rail network.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	Access to the network is granted by the infrastructure manager through track access arrangements with licensed rail operators, with oversight by the regulatory body in certain EU countries.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P91_S2	Currently, all of the infrastructure managers in the European countries in which we operate are owned or controlled by the respective governments in each country.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	The governments of each member state have ministries or departments dedicated to transport who are responsible for the long-term strategy, planning and funding of the transport infrastructure, including rail.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	These departments are also responsible for implementing European directives into domestic legislation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	Currently, there is an ongoing governmental review into the structure, role and function of Network Rail in the U.K.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	The result of this review may affect our operations and increase our operating costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations, which frequently involve transporting hazardous materials.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements in all material respects.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P95_S2	We estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P95_S3	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	North American Operations In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are administered and implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions, and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	As a result of our operations, we receive notices from time to time from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P96_S3	In the United States, one of our subsidiaries, Luxapalila Valley Railroad Inc., recently paid a civil penalty of $106,100 related to the storage of steel dust on behalf of a customer in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P96_S4	Also, we received a notice in November 2014 from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P96_S5	The cleanup associated with this derailment is substantially complete, but a fine associated with the contamination has not yet been assessed.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	In Australia, environmental laws and regulations are administered primarily by the Department of Environment at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state and territories level.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P97_S2	Our railroads in Australia operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements, of which we have two in Australia, one with the South Australian Environmental Protection Agency under EPA License 2933 and the other with the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Agency under EPL 107.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P97_S3	Both of these environmental protection licenses require us to provide annual returns demonstrating compliance with their operational and administrative conditions.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P97_S4	They also have embedded in them conditions that require us to make certain notification in the event of an occurrence that is likely to breach a condition of the licenses or the legislation.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P97_S5	These conditions have been managed effectively to date with no notifications required.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	The Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our Australian Operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	Consequently, the Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_17_ITEM1_P98_S2	Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the implementation of remedial actions, the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our lease.

1012620_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business, and changes in commodity prices could decrease demand for the transport of commodities.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Slower economic growth, an economic recession, significant changes in global economic conditions or commodity prices or import or export volumes or changes in government regulation could negatively impact our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For instance, lower prices of commodities, such as iron ore, coal and manganese, could be a factor influencing decisions to delay, cancel or suspend certain mining projects in Australia and elsewhere, which could reduce the demand for our services.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Further, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows, the export coal carried by our railroads, particularly in Australia, could decline.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agricultural commodity prices are also inherently susceptible to fluctuation.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	For example, a decline in the price of corn that we transport may result in lower revenues for us if farmers decide to store such corn until the price increases.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If we experience significant decline in demand for our services with respect to one or more commodities or products, we may experience lower revenues, increased operating costs, workforce adjustments and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, we are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from changing patterns of economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may be required to forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, from time to time, we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Instability or disruptions in the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access to the capital markets and could also increase our cost of capital.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P2_S10	If we are unable to obtain additional capital at a reasonable cost, we may be required to forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our growth strategy is based in part on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past, partially due to the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	As our business grows, we may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant unexpected costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Further, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, commodity trends, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served and the associated revenues, the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements, including renewals of leases with other railroads or extensions of government subsidies, operating costs, competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	There is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that we will not discover unanticipated liabilities.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Further, while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Also, the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S6	For example, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S9	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P7_S10	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is insufficient right to indemnification, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For instance, we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with floating interest rate payments under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	While these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our operations served approximately 3,000 customers in 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Revenues from our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 22% of our operating revenues in 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	One of our 10 largest customers in 2016 , Arrium Limited (Arrium), a mining and materials company located in Australia, accounted for approximately 2% of our operating revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our Australian Operations historically served two of Arrium's mining assets, including the Southern Iron mine, which was mothballed in the second quarter of 2015 as a result of the significant decline in the price of iron ore, and the Whyalla-based operations, which comprise the Middleback Ranges iron ore mines and the Whyalla Steelworks ("Whyalla Contract"), that continue to operate.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	On April 7, 2016, Arrium announced it had entered into voluntary administration and more recently announced that a sale of the Whyalla operations is likely.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Following the voluntary administration, all payments to GWA associated with the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement ceased.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	While GWA continues to receive payments and provide service under the Whyalla Contract pending the outcome of the voluntary administration and process, GWA could also lose some or all of the revenue associated with the remaining Arrium service.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our contracts are generally in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	As a consequence, there is rarely a guarantee that past volumes or revenues will continue in the future.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, under these contracts, freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped, and there is no customary contractual protection in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Substantial reduction in business with, or loss of, important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S8	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, shutdowns, operational failures or other reasons.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Over the last two years, several of our mining, metals and maritime shipping customers instituted insolvency proceedings.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In the United States, for interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Therefore, when we are the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, when we are not the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to credit risk at the customer and invoicing railroad levels.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular for those in the mining and natural resources industry.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We usually enter into long-term contracts with these customers that include fixed and variable payment terms.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Under these contracts the customers pay a fixed payment independent of actual volume shipped as well as a variable rate per ton shipped, with the fixed payment often representing the majority of the total contract payments.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Under these arrangements, we are exposed to start-up risks for new operations as well as ongoing operational risks, including exposure to mine shutdowns, that may reduce the variable payments, as well as customer insolvency risk that could impact our ability to collect our fixed payments.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and evaluating credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S10	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S11	As a result, unexpected credit exposures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In 2016 , approximately 83% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease or re-route certain freight movements or to alter existing business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The financial impact of any such decision would depend on which of our routes and freight movements were affected, as well as the nature of any changes.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, Class I carriers also traditionally have been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements, freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We lease many of our railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under lease arrangements with varied expirations, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 7.5% of our 2016 total operating revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	For example, our revenues associated with leases from Class I railroads and other third parties subject to expiration in each of the next five years ( 2017 - 2021 ) would represent approximately 1.1% , 1.4% , 0.0% , 0.0% and 0.6% of our operating revenues in each of those years, respectively, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our results of operations and rail infrastructure are susceptible to weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the United States or Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States or Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment, washout or other substantial disruption of our operations and those of the entire freight rail network, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Weather impacts or other conditions that do not directly affect our operations can still impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States or the U.K., which lessen demand for electricity, which in turn lessons the demand for coal.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our revenues generated from the transportation of agricultural products in North America and Australia are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions and the South Australian grain harvest is also susceptible to the impact of droughts or heavy rains and flooding in South Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance, overtime and diesel fuel costs in the winter at our railroads in the United States and Canada related to snow removal, mandated work breaks and locomotive idling.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Adverse weather conditions that disrupt the entire freight rail network can also cause traffic diversions, prolonged delays and equipment shortages that impact our ability to serve our customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The development of some of our business could be hindered if we fail to maintain satisfactory working relationships with partners in Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Following our acquisition of GRail, our Australian Operations are conducted through the Australia Partnership, in which we own a controlling 51.1% ownership interest and, therefore, include 100% of our Australian Operations within our consolidated financial statements with a 48.9% noncontrolling interest recorded to reflect MIRA's ownership.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	However, as a consequence of the partnership agreement, we do not have absolute control over the operations of the Australia Partnership.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Australia Partnership is governed by a management committee, which is comprised of representatives appointed by both MIRA and G W as general partners.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Certain matters require approval by both MIRA and us, including: (i) hiring and dismissing select executives of the partnership; (ii) commitments relating to significant contracts or other matters; (iii) approval of the partnership s strategic plan, which is a long-term plan outlining the expectations of MIRA and us for the business (including leverage, equity returns and capitalization); (iv) mergers or consolidations; (v) incurrence of material indebtedness; (vi) capital structure changes; (vii) changes to the distribution policy; and (viii) related-party transactions.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Accordingly, our ability to maintain constructive and cooperative relations with MIRA will be critical to our ability to implement our plans and expand our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Any failure to maintain satisfactory working relationships with MIRA or the need to dedicate significant management resources and time to align our interests with the interests of MIRA could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Furthermore, should we fail to maintain a controlling interest in the Australia Partnership, we will deconsolidate our Australian Operations and account for them under the equity method of accounting.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our Credit Agreement as well as our Australian Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our Credit Agreement as well as our Australian Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our Credit Agreement and the Australian Credit Agreement also contain financial covenants that require us and the borrower under each agreement to meet financial ratios and tests.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Failure to comply with the obligations in our Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement, or other debt agreements, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate the related indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had a total indebtedness of $2.4 billion , and we had unused commitments of $541.6 million under our Credit Agreement (after giving effect to $2.4 million of undrawn letters of credit that reduces such availability).
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, we had unused commitments of A$46.9 million under the Australian Credit Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Subject to the limits contained in our Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of cost or risk, which could result in material losses.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including toxic/poisonous inhalation hazard (TIH/PIH) materials, such as chlorine, crude oil and other dangerous substances that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additionally, United States laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A rail accident or other incident or accident on our railroads, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, insurance premiums charged for, or the self-insured retention associated with, some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these materials.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads' transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S6	For instance, existing legislation requires pre-notification for hazardous materials shipments.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Additionally, regulations adopted by the DOT and the DHS could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S9	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S10	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S11	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S12	We may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding for capital projects or to benefit from revenue support grants.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S13	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S14	During 2016 , we obtained partial or complete funding by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies for 62 new projects.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S15	The net spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 5% of our net capital expenditures during 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S16	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability or require us to accept onerous contractual obligations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S17	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P30_S18	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects, incur additional debt or use additional cash.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Freightliner benefits from the U.K. Government administered Mode Shift Revenue Support Scheme (MSRS), which supports the movement of freight away from road, particularly in the container market.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	While the U.K. Government confirmed its continued funding of MSRS in 2016, the amount of the funding available for the periods subsequent to 2016 may be less than in prior years.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Reduced grants may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We purchase insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments, grade crossing accidents, collisions and other incidents or occurrences.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading, grade crossing accidents, collisions or other incidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other accidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub-limits or give rise to losses or penalties that are not covered by our insurance.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In addition, on certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are operated over the same track as passenger trains.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For instance, in Oregon, our Portland Western Railroad operates certain passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, our New England Central Railroad is also used by Amtrak for passenger service in New England, our Connecticut Southern Railroad operates over Amtrak trackage in Connecticut and our recently acquired P W railroad operates over MetroNorth Commuter Railroad trackage in New York and Connecticut and also operates over Amtrak trackage in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In Australia, The Ghan passenger train is operated by a third party over the track of GWA (North) Pty Ltd between Tarcoola and Darwin and GRail operations also have touchpoints with the passenger network in New South Wales.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Further, we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia, freight trains are primarily operated over the same track as passenger trains and will also regularly pass through passenger stations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Derailments, collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Moreover, certain third-party freight and excursion train operators have contractual rights to operate over certain of our rail lines.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These third-party operators generally are required to maintain minimum levels of insurance coverage, but there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all of the losses arising from an incident involving such operators on our rail lines.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property or rail liability losses, as well as subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us, including such things as derailments, accidents, discharge of toxic or hazardous materials, or other like occurrences in the industry, may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims' expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations associated with new legislation, executive orders issued by the President of the United States and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other regulations by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	New rules or regulations mandated by these agencies could increase our operating costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	For example, the FRA rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which were more recently amended in October 2015, require compliance as early as December 31, 2018.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S5	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track, and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads are required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P37_S7	While we do not expect that our compliance with these PTC requirements will give rise to any material financial expenditures, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, there are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the United States in recent years to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Various proceedings have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition, interchange commitments and competitive access.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	A DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits also commenced in 2012.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The results of the DOT study were released in 2015, but data limitations continue to hinder any near term changes to the federal truck size and weight limits.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Many of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, specific initiatives being considered by Congress, the STB or other regulators could expand regulation of our railroad operations and undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Expanded regulation of our railroad operations will increase the cost of providing rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Currently, there is an ongoing governmental review into the structure, role and function of Network Rail in the U.K.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The result of this review may affect our operations and increase our operating costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Business Regulation" for a discussion of these regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, changes in the dynamics of global energy markets, including the closure of coal-fired power plants we serve, climate change litigation and climate change itself could adversely affect our operating costs, decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, as well as its physical impacts, could materially affect us.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	For example, federal, state and local laws, regulations, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives, equipment, vehicles and machinery or our rail yards.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Further, restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including, for example, coal mining operations, natural gas producers, coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Significant cost increases, government regulation, changes in market dynamics or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	For instance, over the past few years, production of natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants in the United States could be displaced.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Further, we carry significant coal volumes in Australia that are destined for export to Asia.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S9	A decrease in the demand for coal in the United States or Asia could further reduce our coal volumes and revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S11	Finally, we could face changes to our operations and decreased revenues associated with climate change.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S12	We may also experience increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change, including claims alleging that our operations have a negative impact on climate change.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S13	Any such market or regulatory responses or litigation, as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming, such as floods, rising sea levels, increasingly frequent and intense storms and any alteration of trade patterns, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S14	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S15	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the generation handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S16	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S17	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned, leased or operated by us, properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned, leased or operated by us, including from lading in the event of a derailment.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S18	For instance, one of our subsidiaries, Luxapalila Valley Railroad, Inc., recently paid a civil penalty of $106,100 related to the storage of steel dust on behalf of a customer in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S19	In addition, we received a notice in November 2014 from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P41_S20	The cleanup associated with this derailment is substantially complete but a fine associated with the contamination has not yet been assessed.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Under some environmental statutes, liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be "joint and several," whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	While we maintain insurance for certain environmental damages and claims, environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs and expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination that may or may not be fully covered by our insurance.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Violations of, and liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or grant to other rail carriers access rights to our rail lines or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions or automation.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S6	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Also, commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S8	For example, natural gas can compete with coal that we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S9	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S10	In addition, we are subject to import competition, where commodities that we transport face competition from less expensive imported products.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S11	Some of the products that we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S12	The extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S13	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S14	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S15	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S16	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S17	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S18	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P46_S19	We consumed 68.0 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2016 and 63.3 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war, terrorist attack or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices, although there may be a significant delay in our recovery of fuel costs based on the terms of the fuel surcharge program.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	However, if Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease, which could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 7% and 8% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P47_S6	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, environmental contamination, freight loss, property damage and other matters.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	From time to time, we also have various contractual disputes with interchange partners and customers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury or environmental liability against us or monetary damages associated with a breach of contract or other claims that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , we are a party to approximately 97 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and U.K./Europe.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to approximately 29 of these agreements, and are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements with three newly represented bargaining units.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Approximately 4,100 of our approximately 7,300 full time employees are either union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by labor agreements or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S6	In addition, we have 65 employees who have elected to have union representation and are in the process of negotiating their first collective bargaining agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P49_S7	We also have entered into employee association agreements with an additional 33 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	GWA has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In the U.K./Europe we have various collective bargaining agreements, as well as agreements with local work councils.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P50_S4	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P50_S5	If such Class I railroads were to have a work slowdown or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	In the U.K., our operations are reliant on the rail infrastructure provided by Network Rail.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	A majority of Networks Rail s employees are unionized, and if Network Rail were to have a work stoppage or strike, the U.K. rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, or attract and retain senior leadership, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S5	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S6	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 9% of our current workforce will become eligible for retirement based on an average retirement age of 61.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S8	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S9	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and more generous benefits.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P51_S10	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The execution of our growth strategy, in particular our acquisition and investment strategy, is substantially dependent on our senior management team.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We rely on our senior management team to execute our growth strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our growth strategy is different than the strategy of many other railroads because of our acquisition and investment focus.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Further, the loss of any executive officers or key employees could require the remaining senior leadership to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S7	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership, and the inability to find a suitable replacement, could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P52_S8	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting as well as disclosure controls and procedures, we could become subject to regulatory scrutiny and current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our management s report and an independent registered public accounting firm's report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	As we execute our acquisition strategy, consistent with the guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may elect to omit an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of a recently acquired business in the year of acquisition from management's report.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Recently acquired businesses are required to be included in our assessment of internal control over financial reporting no later than in the year subsequent to the acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	The failure to implement and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, as well as disclosure controls and procedures, could result in our identification of material weaknesses in our financial reporting controls that may cause errors in our financial statements that could have a material effect on our financial results, financial position or liquidity and in the accompanying footnote disclosures.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Such errors could also require restatements of previously issued financial statements.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We cannot guarantee that we will not identify and report any material weaknesses in the future.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Should such events occur, we may become subject to regulatory scrutiny and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and disclosure, which could negatively impact our stock price.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as railcars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain railcars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In some cases, we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S6	For example, in Australia, the availability of new locomotives is limited, with long lead times for delivery.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We rely on the stability and availability of our technology systems to operate our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The performance and reliability of our technology systems, as well as those provided by critical vendors, is critical to our ability to operate and compete safely and effectively.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	A cyber security attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including security costs to protect our infrastructure.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	A disruption or compromise of our information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Some of our subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the U.K., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Saudi Arabia.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Because some of our subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We have operations in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and Europe.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (including, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Polish zloty) and then translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average exchange rate for the statement period.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, Freightliner, as part of a British consortium, provides management and technical support for infrastructure and freight operations to Saudi Railway Company, a government-owned company established in 2006 and tasked with developing and operating railway services, pursuant to a contract that expires in 2020.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Payments under the contract are made in Saudi riyal and are converted into British pounds and included in our consolidated operating income in U.K./Europe.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our consolidated results of operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Moreover, foreign governments may restrict transfers of cash out of the country and control exchange rates.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to repatriate our earnings, and at exchange rates that are beneficial to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in United States dollars, such fluctuations may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be canceled, and there is no guarantee these agreements will be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line expires in 2054 and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If our concession or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services, disruption to service and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	European countries in which our subsidiaries operate also have open access regimes that permit third-party rail operators to compete for the business of our subsidiaries that operate in such countries.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Further, the open access nature of the rail network could lead to disruptions to services as infrastructure maintenance and scheduling operations are outside our control.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S2	The loss of our customers to competitors or unexpected disruptions in service could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S5	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S6	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S7	In the U.K., if the Office of Rail and Road, the independent safety and economic regulator for Britain's railways, were to change the access regime, even if we were able to pass any increased fees onto customers, we may be less competitive and our revenues could decline.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S8	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S9	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P68_S10	Changes to the open access regimes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia and U.K./Europe hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Following significant derailments, the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We have significant pension funding obligations.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	We provide a defined benefit pension program for our U.K. employees through a standalone shared cost arrangement within the Railways Pension Scheme (Pension Program).
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S4	The Pension Program has more than 300,000 active and retired employees, and participation by more than 150 rail companies with assets under management of approximately 25 billion .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S5	There are six discrete sections within the Pension Program and participating employers may set up more than one arrangement in the program.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P71_S6	There is no cross-subsidy or funding obligation between the discrete sections of the Pension Program or between the discrete arrangements of any participating employers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Pension Program is managed and administered by a professional pension administration company and is overseen by trustees with professional advice from independent actuaries and other advisers.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our section of the Pension Program is a shared cost arrangement with required contributions shared between us and our employees with our contribution being 60% and the remaining 40% contributed by active employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The Pension Program's assets are subject to market fluctuation, and its assets and liabilities are formally valued on an independent actuarial basis every three years.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	A key element of the valuation process is an assessment of the creditworthiness of the participating employer.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Less creditworthy employers are encouraged to invest in lower risk assets, with on average lower returns, which impacts the assessment of the pension liabilities and any underlying deficit.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In the event that our section of the Pension Program is underfunded on an actuarial basis at any valuation point, the shared cost nature of the program means that we are responsible for paying 60% of any deficit contributions, with active employees contributing the remaining 40%, in each case over a recovery period agreed with the trustees.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If our section of the Pension Program is terminated and wound up, any deficit would fall entirely on us and would not be shared with active employees.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Equally, if all active employees were to leave our section, we would have full responsibility for funding any deficits.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S5	As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 1,600 active employees in our section of the Pension Program.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S6	Our pension expense and funding of our section of the Pension Program may increase in the future and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P75_S7	Political and economic uncertainty arising from a majority of voters approving a referendum for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union could adversely impact our operations and financial results.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government, subject, potentially, to a vote of the British Parliament, will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal from the EU.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P76_S2	A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the EU.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P76_S5	Our U.K./European Operations represented approximately 27% of our consolidated revenues in 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the weakening of the British pound against the United States dollar.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	During periods of a weakening British pound, our reported international revenues are reduced because the British pound translates into fewer United States dollars.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently, and any other bilateral trade agreements the U.K. can reach with other trade partners.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Any of the potential effects of Brexit could have unpredictable consequences for credit markets and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	RISKS RELATED TO TAXATION The United States Short Line Tax Credit expired on December 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	As a result, our effective tax rate in 2017 will be higher.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures, owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P80_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of its tax year.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit was initially enacted for a three year period, 2005 through 2007, and was subsequently extended a series of times with the last extension expiring on December 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	There is no guarantee that the Short Line Tax Credit will be extended again.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Further, recent discussions related to potential corporate tax reform in the United States, as well as presidential infrastructure spending objectives, could impact the likelihood of an extension of the Short Line Tax Credit or yield changes to the Short Line Tax Credit.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P81_S3	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for 2017 and additional tax years, or is modified prospectively, or the benefit derived from the credit is not replaced through more comprehensive tax reform or otherwise, the loss or a reduction of the credit will increase our tax rate and reduce our earnings per share.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were to be distributed, our effective tax rate could be higher.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.

1012620_17_ITEM1A_P82_S4	The amount of those earnings was $267.1 million as of December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P82_S5	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, which could result in a higher effective tax rate for us, thereby reducing our earnings.

1012620_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	It is possible that we are a United States real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If we are or become a United States real property holding corporation, so long as our Class A Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder (i.e., a holder that is not a United States citizen or resident, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and certain trusts and estates) who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our Class A Common Stock, by reason of our status as a United States real property holding corporation.
1012620_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The rail properties that we own and operate in North America typically consist of the track and the underlying land.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	Real estate adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way is generally owned by others, and our holdings of such real estate are not material.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Further, unless we own the rail properties outright, we do not normally control mineral rights or the ability to grant fiber optic and other easements in the properties.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Several of our railroads are operated under leases or operating licenses in which we do not assume ownership of the track or the underlying land.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	Further, under open access regimes as more fully described under "Part I Item 1.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	Business," the track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 15,900 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	Several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire in the next few years and may not be extended.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that could expire in each of the next 10 years would represent less than 2% of our annual revenues in the year of expiration, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM2_P2_S3	For additional information on these lease expirations, see "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	We also operate, through various trackage and operating rights agreements, over approximately 6,200 additional miles of track that are owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P3_S1	The track miles listed below exclude approximately 2,080 miles of sidings and yards ( 1,830 miles in the United States, 170 miles in Canada and 80 miles in Australia).
1012620_17_ITEM2_P3_S2	Track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.K. are also excluded.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	We have recorded mortgages on many of the owned properties located in the United States and described in the table below as additional security for our outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement.

1012620_17_ITEM2_P6_S0	EQUIPMENT As of December 31, 2016 , our rolling stock consisted of 1,348 locomotives, of which 1,039 were owned and 309 were leased, and 29,430 railcars, of which 8,692 were owned and 20,738 were leased.
1012620_17_ITEM2_P6_S1	A breakdown of the types of railcars owned and leased by us as of December 31, 2016 is set forth in the table below:
1012620_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury and environmental liability, disputes involving our railroads or other claims against us that are not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	For instance, we received a notice in November 2014 from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama, but a fine associated with the contamination has not yet been assessed.
1012620_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits.
1012620_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	Based upon currently available information, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

1012620_17_ITEM6_P0_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	On November 1, 2016 , we completed the acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W) for $126.2 million .
1012620_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	On December 1, 2016 , one of our Australian subsidiaries completed the acquisition of GRail for A$1.14 billion and concurrently issued a 48.9% equity stake in G W Australia Holdings LP (GWAHLP or the Partnership), which is the holding entity for all of the Company s Australian businesses, including GRail, to MIRA.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	On December 13, 2016 , we completed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at $75.00 per share and received net proceeds of $ 285.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P1_S3	In addition, we incurred impairment and related charges of $57.3 million , including $21.5 million related to our ERS business in Continental Europe, $21.1 million related to the impairment of our rolling stock maintenance facility and associated write-off of accounts receivable resulting from an iron ore customer in Australia entering voluntary administration and $14.7 million charges related to leases of idle excess U.K. coal railcars, as well as $26.6 million of corporate development and related costs.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) On January 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Pinsly Arkansas for $41.3 million in cash.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	On March 25, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, for total consideration of 516.3 million (or $769.1 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S1	In addition, we incurred $15.3 million of acquisition/integration costs primarily associated with Freightliner and recorded a loss of $18.7 million on the settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts during 2015, which were entered into in contemplation of the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S2	(c) On May 30, 2014, our new subsidiary, Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc. (RCP E), purchased the assets of the western end of CP's DM E rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S3	(d) On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S4	On the conversion date, we also paid to affiliates of Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle) cash in lieu of fractional shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock totaling $2.1 million .
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S5	In addition, we incurred $17.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2013.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S6	(e) On October 1, 2012, we acquired 100% of RailAmerica for approximately $2.0 billion (equity purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion , or $27.50 per share, plus the payoff of RailAmerica's debt of $659.2 million ).
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S7	The shares of RailAmerica were held in a voting trust while the STB considered our control application, which application was approved with an effective date of December 28, 2012.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S8	Accordingly, we accounted for the earnings of RailAmerica using the equity method of accounting while the shares were held in the voting trust and our preliminary determination of fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S9	In addition, we incurred $30.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2012.
1012620_17_ITEM6_P3_S10	We also recorded a $50.1 million non-cash mark-to-market expense in 2012 related to an investment agreement governing the sale of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to Carlyle in connection with the funding of the RailAmerica acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	When comparing our results of operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shutdowns, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, high winds, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding, among other factors.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	In periods when these events occur, our results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, global commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, such as steel products, iron ore, paper products, lumber and forest products and agricultural products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil and natural gas liquids).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	As a result of these and other factors, our results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our results of operations in other reporting periods.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	When we discuss foreign exchange impact, we are referring to the change in our results due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	We calculate foreign exchange impact by comparing the prior period results translated from local currency to United States dollars using current period exchange rates to the prior period results in United States dollars as reported.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Constant currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, reflects the prior period results translated at the current period exchange rates.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	When we discuss results from existing operations or same railroad operations, we are referring to the change in our results, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods ( i.e. , excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Outlook for 2017 Financial Expectations We expect consolidated revenues to grow approximately 8% in 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Operating income is also expected to grow significantly, primarily due to same railroad growth, the impact of the GRail, P W and (pending) Pentalver acquisitions, as well as cost reductions when compared with 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	In North America, we expect revenues to increase approximately 3%, primarily due to higher same railroad freight volumes and pricing, as well as the P W acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	We expect North American operating income to increase, primarily due to higher freight revenues and the full year impact of the P W acquisition, partially offset by higher fuel costs.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	In Australia, we expect operating revenues to increase primarily due to the GRail acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	We expect same railroad Australia revenues to be relatively flat as freight revenues increases in intermodal and agricultural products are expected to be offset by lower mining customer revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	We expect significant growth in Australia operating income, primarily due to the GRail acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S7	Finally, in our U.K./Europe segment we expect revenues to increase 7% in 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S8	The major components underlying the expected revenue growth include contributions from the pending Pentalver acquisition (expected to close in the second quarter of 2017) and increases in intermodal and aggregates freight volumes, which increases are expected to be partially offset by the depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in 2016, as well as the planned restructuring costs associated with the Continental Europe intermodal business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S9	U.K./Europe operating income is expected to significantly increase in 2017 due to the restructuring costs associated with the Continental Europe intermodal business, higher freight revenues and the Pentalver acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S10	We expect to make capital investments totaling $252 million in 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S11	Of this total, $195 million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital and $18 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in the United States.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S12	In addition, we expect to spend $39 million on new business investments, which include track projects, equipment purchases and investments in new facilities.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P3_S13	Our capital plan excludes acquisitions and new business development projects that arise during the year.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	United States Short Line Tax Credit The United States Short Line Tax Credit, from which we have benefited since 2005, expired on December 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Without an extension to the tax credit, we expect our income tax rate to increase significantly in 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	While the Short Line Tax Credit has been extended on five separate occasions in the past, we are unable to predict the outcome of the United States legislative process.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We continue to evaluate a number of potential projects located in all of the geographic markets in which we currently operate and elsewhere around the world.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Overview We own or lease 122 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in 10 operating regions with approximately 7,300 employees and 3,000 customers.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The financial results of our 10 operating regions are reported in the following three distinct segments:
1012620_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our North American Operations segment includes eight regions that serve 41 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces and includes 115 short line and regional freight railroads with more than 13,000 track-miles.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our Australian Operations segment provides rail freight services in New South Wales, including in the Hunter Valley coal supply chain, the Northern Territory and South Australia, including operating the 1,400 -mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of December 1, 2016, G W's Australia Region is 51.1% owned by us and 48.9% owned by a consortium of funds and clients managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our U.K./European Operations segment is led by Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner), the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and second-largest rail freight company.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Operations also include heavy-haul in Poland and Germany and cross-border intermodal services connecting Northern European seaports with key industrial regions throughout the continent.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Our subsidiaries provide rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	As more fully described in Note 18 , Segment and Geographic Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report, the results of operations of the foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar will impact our results of operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	On November 1, 2016, we acquired Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (P W), a Class III regional freight railroad operating in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York, for $25.00 per share, or $126.2 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	For additional information regarding the P W acquisition, see Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Pty Limited (GRail), the third largest coal haulage business in Australia, for A$1.14 billion (or approximately $844.9 million at an exchange rate of $0.74 for one Australian dollar) and concurrently issued a 48.9% equity stake in our Australian subsidiary, G W Australia Holdings LP (GWAHLP) (collectively, the Australia Partnership), the holding company for all of our Australian businesses, to MIRA.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	In conjunction with the acquisition of the GRail business, we entered into a long-term take-or-pay contract with Glencore Coal PTY Limited (GC), subject to existing agreements and certain limitations, to exclusively haul all coal produced at GC's existing mines in the Hunter Valley to the Port of Newcastle.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	As we maintained control of our Australian Operations, we will continue to consolidate 100% of our Australian Operations in our financial statements and now report a noncontrolling interest for MIRA's 48.9% equity ownership.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P16_S6	The decrease in our operating income in 2016 was primarily due to impairment and related charges of $57.3 million , which included $21.5 million related to our European intermodal business, ERS Railways B.V. (ERS), $21.1 million associated with an iron ore customer in Australia entering into voluntary administration and $14.7 million of restructuring and related charges associated with our U.K. coal business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P16_S7	Our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included corporate development and related costs of $23.3 million , primarily related to the GRail, P W and Pentalver transactions, and $4.0 million of restructuring costs, primarily associated with our U.K./European Operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P16_S8	Our same railroad operating ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 84.4% , compared with 80.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	When we discuss either operating ratios from existing operations or same railroad operating ratios, we are referring to the change in our operating ratio, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our net income attributable to G W for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $141.1 million , compared with net income of $225.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.42 with 58.3 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS of $3.89 with 57.8 million weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 34.5% , compared with 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily driven by the effect of foreign operations, which resulted from losses incurred in some foreign jurisdictions generating a tax benefit at tax rates lower than United States statutory rate, a portion of which were reduced by recording of a valuation allowance.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we generated $407.0 million in cash flows from operating activities.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	During the same period, we purchased $219.5 million of property and equipment, including $24.5 million for new business investments, partially offset by $36.1 million in cash received from government grants and other outside parties for capital spending, $15.2 million in insurance proceeds received for the replacement of assets and $2.7 million in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S6	We also paid $969.5 million for the acquisitions of P W and GRail.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S7	In addition, we received proceeds of $476.8 million from MIRA, our noncontrolling interest partner, net proceeds of $285.8 million from our Class A Common Stock offering and net proceeds of $47.4 million primarily related to borrowings from the refinancing of our Credit Agreement in conjunction with our acquisition of GRail.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P18_S8	Our unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2016 was $541.6 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
1012620_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Annual Results by Segment North America Our North American Operations segment exceeded expectations for 2016 and managed through an expected decline in freight traffic (primarily coal) with strong cost controls, which included the consolidation of three operating regions into two.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Offsetting the lower freight revenues were stronger than expected freight-related and all other revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	As a result, North American Operations operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 , increased $22.1 million , or 7.4% , to $319.6 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	Operating revenues from our North American Operations decreased $5.1 million , or 0.4% , to $1,236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with $1,241.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P20_S4	Excluding $5.2 million of revenues from new operations and a $3.7 million decrease from the impact of foreign currency depreciation, our North American Operations same railroad revenues decreased $6.6 million , or 0.5% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	When we discuss either operating revenues from existing operations or same railroad operating revenues, we are referring to the change in our operating revenues, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Total traffic from our North American Operations decreased 70,147 carloads, or 4.3% , to 1,574,253 carloads for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	The decrease consisted of 76,536 carloads, or 4.7% , from existing operations, partially offset by 6,389 carloads from new operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	The decrease in traffic from existing operations was principally due to decreases of 46,257 carloads of coal and coke traffic, 14,160 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, 13,163 carloads of pulp and paper traffic, 7,411 carloads of other commodity traffic, 4,412 carloads of chemicals and plastics traffic and 3,115 carloads of metallic ores traffic, partially offset by increases of 5,826 carloads of waste traffic and 3,678 carloads of metals traffic.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	All remaining traffic increased by a net 2,478 carloads.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S5	Operating income from our North American Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $319.6 million , compared with $297.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P21_S6	The operating ratio from our North American Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 74.2% , compared with 76.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Australia Despite a challenging operating environment that included our largest customer filing for voluntary administration, our Australian Operations segment met expectations in 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, our Australia business underwent a transformational change on December 1, 2016, with the acquisition of GRail and the formation of the Australia Partnership, which we control through our 51.1% interest.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	The GRail acquisition significantly expanded our operations in New South Wales.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	In conjunction with the GRail acquisition that closed on December 1, 2016, we issued a 48.9% equity stake in GWAHLP to MIRA and retained a 51.1% interest.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	As we maintained control of our Australian Operations, we continue to consolidate 100% of our Australian Operations in our financial statements and report a noncontrolling interest for MIRA s 48.9% equity ownership.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S5	Prior to the GRail acquisition, our Australian subsidiary, Freightliner Australia Pty Ltd (FLA), provided rail operator services to GRail which were recorded as freight-related revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S6	These freight-related services continued post acquisition, but are now eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S7	Revenues from GRail were included in our consolidated freight revenues from new operations since the December 1, 2016 acquisition date.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S8	Operating revenues from our Australian Operations decreased $20.4 million , or 8.4% , to $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with $243.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S9	Excluding $17.9 million of net revenues from new operations and a $2.6 million decrease from the impact of foreign currency depreciation, our Australian Operations same railroad operating revenues decreased by $35.7 million , or 14.8% , primarily due to a decrease in freight revenues resulting from a decline in iron ore and manganese shipments.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P22_S10	When comparing our freight-related and all other revenues from existing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 to our freight-related and all other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 , our 2016 existing operations included $4.1 million of revenues for services provided to GRail for the month of December 2016, which were eliminated in consolidated freight-related and all other revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Australian Operations traffic increased 15,490 carloads, or 7.7% , to 216,395 carloads for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase consisted of 35,203 carloads from new operations, partially offset by a decrease from existing operations of 19,713 carloads, or 9.8% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	The carload decrease from existing operations was principally due to decreases of 13,108 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 8,172 carloads of agricultural products traffic and 1,971 carloads of intermodal traffic, partially offset by an increase of 3,570 carloads of minerals and stone traffic.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	Operating income from our Australian Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.8 million , compared with $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P23_S4	The operating ratio from our Australian Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 97.8% , compared with an operating ratio of 77.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The year ended December 31, 2016 included $21.1 million of charges related to the impairment of a rolling-stock maintenance facility and associated write-off of accounts receivable in the first quarter of 2016 resulting from an iron ore customer entering voluntary administration, as well as $14.7 million of corporate development and related costs primarily associated with the GRail transactions.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Our U.K./European Operations segment had a disappointing 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	In addition to expected declines in coal volumes, U.K. intermodal volumes were disrupted by port congestion in the second half of the year and aggregates volumes in the U.K. and Poland were lower than expected.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Most significantly, however, our ERS Continental Europe intermodal business badly underperformed and generated an operating loss.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	In total, we recognized impairment and related charges of $36.2 million related to ERS and the U.K. coal business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	Management is responding with plans to restructure ERS, reduce costs and develop new business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S5	We believe the U.K./Europe performance will improve in 2017, particularly with the inclusion of Pentalver after its expected closing in the second quarter of 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S6	Operating revenues from our U.K./European Operations increased $26.5 million to $542.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with $515.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S7	Operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 included twelve months of revenues from our Freightliner U.K./European operations compared with approximately nine months for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P25_S8	Excluding $116.5 million of revenues from our new operations for the three months when there was no comparable period of ownership in 2015 and a $47.3 million decrease from the impact of foreign currency depreciation, our U.K./European Operations same railroad revenues decreased $42.6 million , or 9.1% , primarily due to lower demand for steam coal in the U.K. and a decline in Continental Europe intermodal services.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	U.K./European Operations traffic increased 216,302 carloads, or 24.4%, to 1,104,016 carloads for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase consisted of 231,791 carloads from new operations, partially offset by a decrease from existing operations of 15,489 carloads, or 1.7% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	The carload decrease from existing operations was primarily due to decreases of 28,943 carloads of coal and coke traffic and 6,027 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, partially offset by increases of 17,397 carloads of intermodal traffic and 1,580 carloads of agricultural products traffic.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	All remaining traffic increased by a net 504 carloads.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	Operating loss from our U.K./European Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $34.7 million , compared with operating income of $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P26_S5	The operating ratio from our U.K./European Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 106.4% , compared with 93.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The year ended December 31, 2016 included impairment and related charges of $21.5 million related to ERS and $14.7 million of restructuring and related charges associated with our U.K. coal business.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Pty Limited: On December 1, 2016 , we completed the acquisition of GRail for A$1.14 billion (or approximately $844.9 million at an exchange rate of $0.74 for one Australian dollar) and concurrently issued a 48.9% equity stake in G W Australia Holdings LP (GWAHLP) (collectively, the Australia Partnership), which is the holding entity for all of our Australian businesses, including GRail, to MIRA, a large private-equity infrastructure investment firm.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, retained a 51.1% ownership in GWAHLP, of which, 50.6% is owned via a limited partner and 0.5% is owned via a general partner.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	The 48.9% is owned by entities controlled by MIRA, of which, 48.4% is owned via a limited partner and 0.5% is owned by a general partner (collectively, the Australia Partnership Transaction).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	As we maintained control of our Australian Operations, we will continue to consolidate 100% of our Australian Operations in our financial statements and report a noncontrolling interest for MIRA s 48.9% equity ownership.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	We established the noncontrolling interest for MIRA's 48.9% equity stake in the carrying value of the net assets of the Australia Partnership at A$383.4 million (or $284.1 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2016 ), which was recorded in our balance sheet.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S5	As the fair value of the MIRA's equity contribution was A$405.4 million (or $300.4 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2016 ), the difference of A$22.0 million (or $16.3 million at the exchange rate the December 1, 2016 ) was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P32_S6	We also reclassified $34.6 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to additional paid-in capital as a result of the issuance of the noncontrolling interest.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The acquisition of GRail was funded through a combination of third-party debt and contributions from us and MIRA in the form of equity and partner loans.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	We and MIRA contributed a combined fair value of A$1.3 billion in the form of cash, partner loans and contributed equity, and our recently established subsidiary, GWI Acquisitions Pty Ltd (GWIA), entered into a five-year A$690 million senior secured term loan facility that is non-recourse to us and to MIRA.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The proceeds were used to acquire GRail for A$1.14 billion , repay Genesee Wyoming Australia s (GWA) existing A$250 million term loan (under our credit facility) and pay an estimated A$18.5 million in debt issuance costs and A$13.2 million of acquisition-related costs (collectively, the GRail Transactions).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P33_S3	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the transaction amounts to United States dollars was $0.74 for one Australian dollar (AUD).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P33_S4	The sources and uses to accomplish the GRail Transactions were as follows (in millions):
1012620_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	GRail s coal haulage business was established in 2010 as an alternative rail service provider to the incumbent railroads in the Hunter Valley and has grown to be the third largest coal haulage business in Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our Freightliner Australia subsidiary (acquired by us in March 2015) has been the rail operator of GRail since inception and presently provides haulage and logistics services for approximately 40 million tonnes per year of steam coal that is among the lowest cost and highest quality coal in the world sold principally to customers in Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	These services have continued following the acquisition of GRail.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	In conjunction with the GRail acquisition, we entered into a 20-year rail haulage contract with the seller, Glencore Coal Pty Limited (GC), to exclusively haul all coal produced at GC s existing mines in the Hunter Valley to the Port of Newcastle.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The contract has minimum guaranteed volumes over the first 18 years and is expected to provide EPS and free cash flow accretion.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	The GRail transaction includes the acquisition of 9 train sets ( 30 locomotives and 894 railcars).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Rail haulage service is operated on government-owned, open access track that is coordinated by a neutral third party.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Track access fees will continue to be paid directly by GC.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The results of operations from GRail have been included in our consolidated statement of operations since the December 1, 2016 acquisition date within our Australian Operations segment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	GRail contributed $7.0 million of net revenues and a $1.1 million net operating loss to our consolidated results since the December 1, 2016 acquisition date.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	We incurred $16.3 million of acquisition costs associated with GRail during the year ended December 31, 2016 , which were included within other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Arrium Limited: Between 2011 and 2014, GWA invested a total of $78 million to purchase locomotives and railcars, as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility to support iron ore shipments from Arrium's Southern Iron mine and Whyalla-based operations, which include the Middleback Range iron ore mines and the Whyalla steelworks.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Arrium mothballed its Southern Iron mine in April 2015, citing the significant decline in the price of iron ore, while the mines in the Middleback Range continued to operate.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	During 2015, GWA carried approximately 8,300 carloads of iron ore from the Southern Iron mine and, in total, generated approximately A$83 million in freight and freight-related revenues (or approximately $62 million , at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015) under the fixed and variable payment structure that is customary in large contracts in Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	On April 7, 2016, Arrium announced it had entered into voluntary administration.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	As a result, we recorded a $13.0 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of a now idle rolling-stock maintenance facility, which was recorded to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses, and an allowance for doubtful accounts charge of $8.1 million associated with accounts receivable from Arrium, which was recorded to other expenses within operating expense, during the three months ended March 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Also as a result of the voluntary administration, all payments to GWA associated with the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement have ceased.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	GWA is in the process of redeploying rolling-stock previously used to provide service under the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement to serve other customers.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	GWA continues to provide service and receive payments under the remaining rail haulage agreement to serve several iron ore mines in the Middleback Range and the Whyalla Steelworks operations, which we expect will represent A$40 million (or approximately $29 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2016 ) of annual revenue prospectively.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Pending the outcome of the voluntary administration process, GWA could lose some or all of the revenue associated with the remaining rail haulage agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	In the event of an adverse determination regarding the viability of the Middleback Range or the Whyalla Steelworks operations, or a termination of the remaining rail haulage agreement, all or a portion of GWA's assets deployed to provide service under this agreement, which consist largely of narrow gauge locomotives and railcars, could be redeployed elsewhere in Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Operations Pentalver Transport Limited: On December 12, 2016, our subsidiary, GWI UK Acquisition Company Limited, entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of APM Terminals (a subsidiary of Maersk) to purchase all of the issued share capital of Pentalver for approximately 87 million (or approximately $107 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2016), subject to final working capital and other closing adjustments.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	The transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of competition clearances and the finalization of certain lease agreements, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Headquartered in Southampton, U.K., Pentalver operates off-dock container terminals (most under long-term lease) strategically placed at each of the four major seaports of Felixstowe, Southampton, London Gateway and Tilbury, as well as an inland terminal located at Cannock, in the U.K. Midlands, near many of the nation s largest distribution centers.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	In addition to providing storage for loaded and empty containers on over 100 acres of land, Pentalver also operates a trucking haulage service with more than 150 trucks, primarily providing daily service between the seaports of Felixstowe and Southampton and its inland terminal at Cannock.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Pentalver also provides services related to container maintenance and repair (including refrigerated containers) and is one of the largest sellers of new and used containers in the U.K.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Pentalver s operations are complementary to those of our Freightliner subsidiary, which is the largest provider of maritime container transportation by rail in the U.K.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The logistics of maritime container transportation in the U.K. are highly competitive, whether by road, rail or short-sea, with a premium placed on timely, efficient and safe service.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	We expect the Pentalver acquisition will enable us to (i) enhance our U.K. services by providing rail and road transportation solutions, as well as offering storage options at the ports and inland, and (ii) unlock efficiencies from shared services and enhanced asset utilization from Pentalver s trucking fleet and Freightliner s existing fleet of approximately 250 trucks that currently provide local collection and delivery haulage from Freightliner s inland terminals.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	With approximately 600 employees, Pentalver will operate as part of our U.K./Europe Region.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	For additional information regarding the acquisition of Pentalver, see Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Continental Europe Intermodal Business: During 2016, we explored ways to enhance the long-term viability of ERS, the Continental Europe intermodal business Freightliner acquired from Maersk, which we acquired in 2015 with the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Due to its limited history of profitability and competitive dynamics in the market in which it operates, we ascribed little value to it at the time of acquisition.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Despite a significant and focused effort by us, the performance of ERS reached unsustainable levels during 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	As such, a restructuring plan was initiated that includes the cessation of all "open" train services from the port of Rotterdam, the closing of the ERS offices in Rotterdam and Frankfurt and the closing of the ERS customer services function in Warsaw.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	We are evaluating opportunities to redistribute ERS s leased locomotives and railcars, which have lease termination dates ranging from 2017 to 2021.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	These steps will enable us to focus on our core competence in the deep-sea intermodal sector.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S6	We expect a smaller sustainable core business to be in operation by mid-2017, thereby eliminating the financial drag that burdened us throughout 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S7	These proposed changes are subject to consultation processes with our employees or works councils in the relevant countries.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S8	Our subsidiary, Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V., will continue its existing services and not be affected by the restructuring of ERS.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S9	As a result of the ERS restructuring plan, we recorded impairment and related charges of $21.5 million in December 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S10	These charges primarily included $14.5 million for an impairment of goodwill and $4.1 million for an impairment of a customer-related intangible asset, which represented the entire carrying value of these assets.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P46_S11	During 2017, we expect to recognize charges of approximately $3 - $4 million related to the restructuring of ERS.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Restructuring of U.K. Coal Business: During 2016, due to a drastic decline in coal shipments, we implemented a restructuring of our U.K. coal business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The U.K. coal business, which we acquired as part of the Freightliner acquisition, is a relatively low-margin business, and we originally expected to cease coal shipments by 2022.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	We incurred charges related to the U.K. coal restructuring program of $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	These charges included $10.5 million associated with leased railcars that exceed our expected ongoing needs and were taken out of service, which was recorded to equipment rents within operating expenses, as well as $4.2 million of severance and related costs associated with restructuring our workforce.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Acquisition of Freightliner Group Limited: On March 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Management Shareholders retained an approximate 6% economic interest in Freightliner in the form of deferred consideration.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	We expect to settle the deferred consideration by the end of 2020.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Headquartered in London, England, Freightliner is an international freight rail operator with operations in the U.K., Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Freightliner's principal business is located in the U.K., where it is the largest maritime intermodal operator and the second largest freight rail operator, providing service throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	In Continental Europe, Freightliner Poland primarily serves aggregates and coal customers in Poland.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	In addition, at the time of acquisition, Freightliner's ERS subsidiary, based in Rotterdam, provided cross-border intermodal services connecting the northern European ports of Rotterdam, Bremerhaven and Hamburg to key cities in Germany, Poland, Italy and beyond.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	In Australia, Freightliner transports coal and containerized agricultural products for its customers in New South Wales.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	As of the acquisition date, Freightliner employed approximately 2,500 people worldwide and had a fleet of primarily leased equipment of approximately 250 standard gauge locomotives, including approximately 45 electric locomotives, and 5,500 railcars.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	We funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Credit Agreement (see Note 8 , Long-Term Debt , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report) and available cash.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the total consideration to United States dollars was $1.49 for one British pound, the exchange rate on March 25, 2015.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	(a) Represents revenues for services provided by Freightliner Australia to GRail for the month of December 2016, which were eliminated in our consolidated revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Operating revenues were $2,001.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with $2,000.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , an increase of $1.1 million , or 0.1% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	The $1.1 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $139.7 million in net revenues from new operations, partially offset by a $138.5 million decrease in existing operations, primarily due to a decrease in freight revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	For additional explanations regarding the changes in our operating revenues, see Operating Results by Segment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $95.8 million , or 5.9% , to $1,711.9 million , compared with $1,616.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	The increase consisted of $140.4 million from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of $44.7 million from existing operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	When we discuss either operating expenses from existing operations or same railroad operating expenses, we are referring to the change in our operating expenses, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Excluding a $48.8 million decrease from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar, operating expenses from existing operations increased $4.1 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	For additional explanations regarding the changes in our total operating expenses, see Operating Results by Segment.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Operating Income/Operating Ratio Operating income was $289.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with $384.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included impairment and related charges of $21.5 million related to ERS, $21.1 million of charges associated with an iron ore customer in Australia entering into voluntary administration and $14.7 million of restructuring and related charges associated with our U.K. coal business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 also included corporate development and related costs of $23.3 million and restructuring costs of $4.0 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 included Freightliner acquisition/integration related costs of $15.3 million , corporate development and related costs of $4.4 million and net gain on sale of assets of $2.3 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S4	Our operating ratio was 85.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with 80.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S5	Our same railroad operating ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 84.4% , compared with 80.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S6	Interest Expense Interest expense was $75.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P59_S7	The increase in interest expense was primarily due to a higher debt balance resulting from the acquisition of Freightliner in March 2015, as well as the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the GRail Transactions in 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Provision for Income Taxes Our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $74.4 million , which represented 34.5% of income before income taxes.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $75.9 million , which represented 25.2% of income before income taxes.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	The increase in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by the effect of foreign operations, which resulted from losses incurred in some foreign jurisdictions generating a tax benefit at tax rates lower than United States statutory rate, a portion of which were reduced by recording of a valuation allowance.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	In addition, our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $28.8 million tax benefit from the United States Short Line Tax Credit and a $4.3 million tax benefit associated with a prospective reduction in the U.K. income tax rate, which was enacted in September 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included a $27.4 million tax benefit associated with the United States Short Line Tax Credit and a $9.7 million tax benefit associated with a prospective reduction in the U.K. income tax rate enacted during the fourth quarter of 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit is an income tax track maintenance credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of its tax year.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit was initially enacted for a three-year period, 2005 through 2007, and was subsequently extended a series of times with the last extension expiring on December 31, 2016.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	The decrease consisted of 76,536 carloads, or 4.7% , from existing operations, partially offset by 6,389 carloads from new operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	The decrease in traffic from existing operations was principally due to decreases of 46,257 carloads of coal and coke traffic, 14,160 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, 13,163 carloads of pulp and paper traffic, 7,411 carloads of other commodity traffic, 4,412 carloads of chemicals and plastics traffic and 3,115 carloads of metallic ores traffic, partially offset by increases of 5,826 carloads of waste traffic and 3,678 carloads of metals traffic.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	All remaining traffic increased by a net 2,478 carloads.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Changes in average freight revenues per carload in a commodity group may be impacted by changes in customer rates and fuel surcharges, as well as changes in the mix of customer traffic within a commodity group.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Excluding the impact of foreign currency, average freight revenues per carload from existing operations increased 0.7% to $580 for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was impacted by a change in commodity mix, which increased average freight revenues per carload 1.1%, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges, which decreased average freight revenues per carload 2.3%.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S3	Excluding these factors, average freight revenues per carload increased 1.9%.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S4	The following information discusses the significant changes in our North American Operations freight revenues from existing operations by commodity group excluding the impact of foreign currency.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S5	Agricultural products revenues decreased $7.4 million , or 6.0% , primarily due to a decrease in average freight revenues per carload of 6.2%.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S6	The decrease was primarily due to a change in customer mix, shorter average length of haul, as well as lower fuel surcharges.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S7	Chemicals and plastics revenues decreased $3.5 million , or 2.5% , primarily due to a traffic decrease of 4,412 carloads, or 2.5%.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S8	The decrease in carloads was primarily due to decreased shipments of industrial chemicals in the western United States.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S9	Coal and coke revenues decreased $18.8 million , or 20.1% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S10	Coal and coke traffic decreased 46,257 carloads, or 17.3%, which decreased revenues by $15.6 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 3.4%, which decreased revenues by $3.2 million.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S11	The decrease in carloads was primarily due to lower demand for steam coal as a result of competition from natural gas power generation.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S12	The decrease in average freight revenues per carload was due to a change in customer mix.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S13	Lumber and forest products revenues increased $3.3 million , or 4.1% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S14	Lumber and forest products average freight revenues per carload increased 3.2%, which increased revenues by $2.7 million, and traffic increased 989 carloads, or 0.7%, which increased revenues by $0.6 million.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S15	The increase in carloads was primarily due to increased lumber shipments in the northeastern United States.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S16	Metallic ores revenues decreased $2.8 million , or 14.4% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S17	Metallic ores traffic decreased 3,115 carloads, or 12.6%, which decreased revenues by $2.4 million, and average freight revenues per carload decreased 2.0%, which decreased revenues by $0.4 million.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S18	The decrease in carloads was primarily due to the planned idling of an alumina customer facility in the southern United States and lower production at a copper facility in the western United States.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S19	Minerals and stone revenues decreased $3.5 million , or 3.0% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S20	Minerals and stone traffic decreased 14,160 carloads, or 6.7%, which decreased revenues by $8.1 million, while average freight revenues per carload increased 4.2%, which increased revenues by $4.6 million.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S21	The decrease in carloads was primarily due to weaker rock salt shipments due to the mild 2015 winter and lower frac sand shipments in the northeastern and midwestern United States, partially offset by stronger aggregates and cement shipments throughout the United States.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S22	The increase in average freight revenues per carload was primarily due to the change in mix of business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S23	Petroleum products increased $2.9 million , or 4.2% , primarily due to an increase in average freight revenues per carload of 4.6%.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S24	Average freight revenues per carload increased primarily due to the change in mix of business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S25	Pulp and paper revenues decreased $9.1 million , or 8.0% , primarily due to a traffic decrease of 13,163 carloads, or 7.5%.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P72_S26	The decrease in carloads was primarily due to decreased shipments resulting from trucking competition and the closure of several plants we served due to consolidation within the paper industry.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S20	The decrease consisted of $6.1 million from existing operations, partially offset by $1.0 million from new operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S21	The decrease from existing operations was primarily attributable to decreased shipments as a result of an iron ore customer mine closure in South Australia that moves over a segment of track owned by a third party.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S22	Other expenses were $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared with $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , a decrease of $4.2 million , or 38.5% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S23	The decrease consisted of $4.8 million from existing operations, partially offset by $0.6 million from new operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S24	The decrease from existing operations was primarily attributable to reduced costs associated with third-party track projects in 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S25	Operating Income/Operating Ratio Operating income from our Australian Operations was $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared with $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S26	Included in the decrease in operating income was a $15.1 million net decrease due to the impact from foreign currency depreciation.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S27	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $2.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of corporate development and related costs.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S28	The operating ratio was 77.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared with 71.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P144_S29	The higher operating ratio was primarily driven by lower iron ore freight revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	The following table sets forth our U.K./European Operations operating revenues and carloads segregated into new operations and existing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	The freight revenues from our U.K./European Operations were comprised entirely of our Freightliner U.K./European operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	Freight revenues from our U.K./European Operations primarily consisted of intermodal traffic, minerals and stone traffic, which includes construction aggregates, and coal.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P147_S2	There were no freight revenues from our U.K./European Operations for 2014, as all of our U.K./European Operations revenues were freight-related in 2014.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	Freight-Related Revenues Freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations includes port switching as well as traction service (or hook and pull service that requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customer's train between specified origin and destination points).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	Freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations also include infrastructure services, where we operate work trains for the track infrastructure owner, drayage and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P148_S2	With the exception of infrastructure services, which are primarily in the U.K., freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations are primarily associated with the Continental European intermodal business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P148_S3	Excluding a $3.5 million decrease due to the impact of foreign currency depreciation, freight-related revenues from our U.K./European Operations increased $169.8 million to $187.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to our new Freightliner operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	All Other Revenues All other revenues from our U.K./European Operations, which includes revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, property rentals and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight, consisted of $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , as a result of our new Freightliner operations.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	The increase included $463.6 million from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of $2.9 million from existing operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	The overall net decrease from existing operations was primarily due to the depreciation of the Euro relative to the United States dollar.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P150_S3	The following table sets forth operating expenses from our U.K./European Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	Equipment rents expense consists primarily of costs associated with Freightliner's predominately leased locomotive and railcar fleet.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P152_S1	Purchased services expense consists primarily of costs associated with the use of contract drivers and outsourced traction service in Europe, as well as port and terminal handling expenses in the U.K. Electricity used in train operations represents the cost of powering the electric locomotive fleet in the U.K. and Continental Europe.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Trackage rights expense represents payments made to track owners under open access regimes.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P153_S1	Operating Income/(Loss) Operating income from our U.K./European Operations was $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared with a $2.0 million operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P153_S2	The loss from our U.K./European Operations included costs associated with the start-up of a significant new long-term customer contract that commenced in early 2014.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P153_S3	The operating ratio was 93.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P153_S4	The prior year is not comparable because over 95% of the revenue and operating income was generated from the recently acquired Freightliner business.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	Our U.K./European Operations operate in an open access environment using primarily leased equipment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $32.3 million and $35.9 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P155_S1	Based on current expectations, we believe our cash, together with our other liquid assets, anticipated future cash flows from operations, availability under our credit agreement, access to debt and equity capital markets and sources of available financing will be sufficient to fund expected operating, capital and debt service requirements and other financial commitments for the foreseeable future.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	On December 13, 2016 , we completed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at $75.00 per share.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	We received net proceeds of $ 285.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses from the sale of our Class A common stock.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P156_S2	We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to partially fund the acquisition of Pentalver Transport Limited and to repay indebtedness.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P162_S1	No. 1 added a senior secured leverage ratio covenant that requires us to comply with maximum ratios of senior secured indebtedness, subject, if applicable, to netting of certain cash and cash equivalents to earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	On October 20, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (Amendment No. 2) to the Credit Agreement.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P163_S2	Amendment No. 2 also permitted the repayment in full and termination of the obligations of the Australia Partnership and its subsidiaries (the Australian Loan Parties) under the Credit Agreement (the Australian Refinancing).
1012620_17_ITEM7_P163_S3	Following the Australian Refinancing and Australian Reorganization, the Australian Loan Parties became unrestricted subsidiaries under, ceased to be party to and have no obligations under the Credit Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P163_S4	In connection with the Australian Reorganization, we repaid in full the outstanding Australian term loan of A$250.0 million (or $185.3 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2016 when the payment was made).

1012620_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	In 2010, as part of the acquisition of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A$50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the carrying value of the loan was A$2.9 million (or $2.1 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2016 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for railcars, locomotives and other equipment as well as real property.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	We also enter into agreements with other railroads and other third parties to operate over certain sections of their track, whereby we pay a per car fee to use the track or make an annual lease payment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P167_S2	The costs associated with operating leases are expensed as incurred.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P167_S3	The increase in leased equipment in 2015 was attributable to our acquisition of Freightliner, which primarily relies upon leased railcars and locomotives.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P167_S4	The number of railcars and locomotives leased by us as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was as follows:
1012620_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	Our operating lease expense for equipment and real property leases and expense for the use of other railroad and other third parties' track for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was as follows (dollars in thousands):
1012620_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	We are party to several lease agreements with Class I carriers and other third parties to operate over various rail lines in North America, with varied expirations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P169_S1	Certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P169_S2	Revenues from railroads we lease from Class I carriers and other third parties accounted for approximately 7.5% of our 2016 total revenues.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P169_S3	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next 10 years represent less than 2% of our annual revenues for the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P170_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P170_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P170_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P170_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that, even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	Insurance and Third-Party Claims Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims was $12.0 million and $26.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P171_S2	The balance from our North American Operations resulted predominately from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a trestle fire in Oregon in August 2015.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P171_S3	The balance from our U.K./European Operations resulted primarily from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a rail-related collision in Germany in 2014 that occurred prior to our acquisition of Freightliner.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P171_S4	We received proceeds from insurance totaling $15.2 million , $10.4 million and $13.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures by segment for the year ending December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of our Credit Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 , there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	(c) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $15.2 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	(d) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures among our existing operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P176_S2	Excludes the pending purchase of all of the issued share capital of Pentalver Transport Limited for approximately 87 million (or approximately $107 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2016), subject to final working capital and other closing adjustments, which was announced on December 12, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P176_S3	(e) Includes deferred consideration related to the acquisition of Freightliner of $31.9 million , deferred compensation of $10.0 million , estimated casualty obligations of $7.3 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $13.9 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P176_S4	In addition, the table includes our 2017 estimated contributions of $9.5 million to our pension plans and estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $3.5 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P177_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016 consisted of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above, as well as credit/payment guarantees acquired from Freightliner.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P177_S2	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included within "Part IV Item 15.

1012620_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	Impact of Foreign Currencies on Operating Revenues and Expenses When comparing the effects of average foreign currency exchange rates on operating revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 versus the year ended December 31, 2015 , foreign currency translation had a negative impact on our consolidated operating revenues and a positive impact on our consolidated operating expenses due to the weakening of the Australian and Canadian dollars, the British pound, and the Euro relative to the United States dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	The following table reflects the average exchange rates used to translate the foreign entities respective local currency results of operations into United States dollars for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
1012620_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P180_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	The following critical accounting policies and use of estimates should be read in conjunction with Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	We account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P183_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P183_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P183_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business's acquisition date.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P184_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P184_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P184_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge's capacity to carry increased loads and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P185_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P185_S3	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P186_S1	Our largest category of capital expenditures is for track line upgrades, expansion and replacement, where we will utilize both our employees and professional contractors in completing these capital projects.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	Costs that are directly attributable to self-constructed assets (including overhead costs) are capitalized.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P187_S1	Direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include materials, labor and equipment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P187_S2	Indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P187_S3	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P187_S4	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P189_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	When factors indicate that an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset or asset group in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P190_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value less the cost to sell such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P191_S1	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P191_S2	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P191_S3	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recorded a $13.0 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of a now idle rolling-stock maintenance facility resulting from an iron ore customer in Australia entering voluntary administration.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	For additional information regarding this impairment, see Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P192_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P192_S3	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded within deferred items - grants from outside parties, and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We review the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S1	We perform our annual impairment test as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S2	Additionally, we review the carrying value of goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S3	In conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill combined with previously disclosed efforts to address challenges with our European intermodal business, ERS, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S4	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S5	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ERS.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P194_S6	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , as a result of our annual impairment assessment.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P195_S2	The second step measures the goodwill impairment loss as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P195_S3	For indefinite-lived intangible assets, if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	Impairment losses are expensed when incurred and are charged to net (gain)/loss on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P198_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P198_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as operational network rights, customer contracts and relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P198_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P198_S3	In conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill combined with previously disclosed efforts to address challenges with ERS, we recorded an impairment of a customer-related intangible asset of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P198_S4	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P198_S5	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ERS.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P199_S0	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain global liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P199_S1	Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and other third-party claims associated with our operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P199_S2	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P199_S3	Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P200_S0	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P200_S1	Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P200_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P200_S3	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P200_S4	We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P201_S0	Accruals for claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P201_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S0	Defined Benefit Plans We sponsor certain defined benefit plans covering eligible employees.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S1	We engage independent actuaries to compute amounts of liabilities and expenses related to these plans subject to the assumptions that we determine are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S2	These assumptions include, but are not limited to the selection of a discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, inflation volatility and mortality.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S3	For additional information regarding these plans, see Note 11 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S4	U.K. Pension Plan and Note 12 .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S5	Other Employee Benefit Programs to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P202_S6	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P203_S0	Income Taxes We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P203_S1	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P204_S0	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P204_S1	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P205_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P205_S1	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P206_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P207_S0	No provision is made for the United States income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P207_S1	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may be subject to United States income taxes (appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, however, the amount of the tax and credits is not practicable to determine .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P207_S2	The amount of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 was $267.1 million .
1012620_17_ITEM7_P208_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 20 , Recently Issued Accounting Standards , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7_P208_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The following table presents principal payments on our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using Australia BBSY and BBR, Canada BA, Euro LIBOR and United States LIBOR (as of December 31, 2016 ).
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	BBSY is the Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	BBR is the Bankers Buyers Rate, which we believe is generally considered analogous with BBSY.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 2.00% for Canadian, European and United States borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 2.78% for our Australian term loan under our Australian Credit Agreement and 4.50% for our Partner Loan Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $13.3 million under our Credit Agreement and $3.0 million under our Australian Credit Agreement and Partner Loan Agreement.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , our foreign subsidiaries had the United States dollar equivalent of $945.7 million of third-party debt denominated in the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by our foreign subsidiaries and is paid by United States subsidiaries, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from our United States subsidiaries to our foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign currency forward purchase contracts.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts may be entered into for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	However, cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt may not qualify for hedge accounting.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	In cases where the cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S4	For additional information regarding our Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 9 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S5	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S6	Deferred Consideration On March 25, 2015, as part of the Freightliner acquisition, we recorded a contingent liability within other long-term liabilities of 24.2 million (or $36.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S7	This contingent liability represents the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to us by the Management Shareholders representing an economic interest of approximately 6% on the acquisition date at the Freightliner acquisition price per share, in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest in the future (deferred consideration).
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S8	We will recalculate the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration in each reporting period until it is paid in full by using a contractual formula designed to estimate the economic value of the Management Shareholders' retained interest in a manner consistent with that used to derive the Freightliner acquisition price per share on the acquisition date.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S9	Accordingly, a change in the fair value of the deferred consideration could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which a change in estimate occurs.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S10	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recognized $2.3 million , through other expenses within our consolidated statements of operations, as a result of the change in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration, which primarily represented the time value of money.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S11	We expect to recognize future changes in the contingent liability for the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration through other expenses within our consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S12	These future changes in the estimated fair value of the deferred consideration are not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S13	Each of the Management Shareholders may elect to receive one third of their respective deferred consideration valued as of March 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S14	Any remaining portion of the deferred consideration will be valued as of March 31, 2020, and paid by the end of 2020.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S15	For additional information regarding our deferred consideration, see Note 10 , Fair Value of Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S16	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S17	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S18	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 6.9% of our total operating expenses.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S19	As of December 31, 2016 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S20	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that partially offset the impact of higher fuel prices.
1012620_17_ITEM7A_P5_S21	As of December 31, 2016 , each one percentage point change in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $1.3 million change in our annual operating income to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	On November 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of P W and on December 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GRail.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as appropriate, to include P W's and GRail's financial position, results of operations and cash flow into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	We are continuing to integrate the acquired operations of P W and GRail into our overall internal control over financial reporting and related processes.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Except as disclosed in this paragraph, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company's internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company's Audit Committee.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Consistent with the guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting related to P W and GRail.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	The Company acquired P W in a business combination on November 1, 2016 and acquired GRail in a business combination on December 1, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S4	P W's and GRail's total assets represented 2% and 13% , respectively, of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S5	P W's total revenues and operating income for the period November 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 each represented less than 1% of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S6	GRail's total revenues and operating income for the period December 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 each represented less than 1% of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S7	Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2016 , we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_17_ITEM9A_P4_S8	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report, which is included herein under "Part IV.
1012620_17_ITEM10_P0_S0	We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to all directors, officers and employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Accounting Officer and Global Controller.
1012620_17_ITEM10_P0_S1	The Code of Ethics and Conduct is available on the Governance page of the Company's Internet website at www.gwrr.com.
1012620_17_ITEM10_P0_S2	We intend to post any amendments to the Code of Ethics and Conduct and any waivers that are required to be disclosed by the rules of either the SEC or the NYSE on our Internet website within the required time period.

1012620_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	We own or lease 122 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in nine operating regions with approximately 8,000 employees and 3,000 customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our seven North American regions serve 41 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces and include 115 short line and regional freight railroads with more than 13,000 track-miles.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our Australia Region serves New South Wales, the Northern Territory and South Australia and operates the 1,400 -mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of December 1, 2016, the Australia Region is 51.1% owned by G W and 48.9% owned by a consortium of funds and clients managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our U.K./European Region includes the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and second-largest freight rail provider, as well as regional rail services in Continental Europe.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our subsidiaries and joint ventures also provide rail service at more than 40 major ports, rail-ferry service between the United States Southeast and Mexico, transload services, contract coal loading, and industrial railcar switching and repair.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	During the third quarter of 2017, our Mountain West Region railroads were consolidated into our Central and Pacific regions, and the Pacific Region was renamed the Western Region.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	The consolidation reduced our number of operating regions from ten to nine.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S4	Pty Limited (GRail) and the formation of the Australia Partnership, which we control through our 51.1% interest.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S5	The GRail acquisition significantly expanded our operations in New South Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S6	In conjunction with the GRail acquisition, we issued a 48.9% equity stake in our Australian subsidiary, G W Australia Holdings LP (GWAHLP), to MIRA.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S7	We retained a 51.1% controlling interest in GWAHLP and continue to consolidate 100% of our Australian Operations in our financial statements and report a noncontrolling interest for MIRA s 48.9% equity ownership.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S8	As a result, (1) 100% of the assets and liabilities of our Australian Operations, after the elimination of intercompany balances, were included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, with MIRA's 48.9% noncontrolling interest reflected in the equity section, (2) our operating revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included 100% of our Australian Operations, while net income attributable to G W reflected our 51.1% ownership position in our Australian Operations since the formation of the partnership on December 1, 2016 and (3) 100% of the cash flows of our Australian Operations, after the elimination of intercompany items, were included in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S9	Accordingly, any payments between our Australian Operations and our other businesses are eliminated in consolidation, while our cash flows reflect 100% of any cash flows between our Australian Operations and MIRA.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P3_S10	Our Australian Operations did not make any equity distributions to the partners during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	GROWTH STRATEGY Since our initial public offering in 1996, our revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 17.3% , from $77.8 million in 1996 to $2.2 billion in 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	Over the same period, our stock price has increased at a compound growth rate of 15.2%, from $3.75 on June 25, 1996, adjusted for stock splits, to $78.73 on December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	We have achieved these results primarily through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, which has two main drivers: (1) our operating strategy; and (2) our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our railroads operate under strong regional management teams, supported by centralized administrative, commercial and operational support and oversight.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , our operations were organized in nine geographic regions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	In North America, we have seven regions: Central (which includes industrial switching operations), Coastal (which includes industrial switching and port operations), Midwest, Northeast, Southern, Western and Canada.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	Outside North America, we have two regions: Australia (which is 51.1% owned by us through the Australia Partnership) and U.K./Europe (which consists of operations in the U.K., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, as well as the provision of management and technical support through Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner) to Saudi Arabia Railway Company).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	In each of our regions, we seek to encourage the entrepreneurial drive, local knowledge, customer service and safety culture that we view as critical to achieving our financial goals.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S5	Our regional managers focus on increasing our return on invested capital, earnings and cash flow through the disciplined execution of our operating strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P5_S6	At the regional level, our operating strategy consists of the following five principal elements:
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that a safe work environment is essential for our employees, our customers and the communities in which we conduct business and that the attention to detail necessary to eliminate employee injuries translates into efficient, well-run operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Each year, we establish stringent safety targets as part of our safety program.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	To monitor our safety performance, we apply the guidelines established by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to all of our operations worldwide.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	In 2017 , our operations achieved a consolidated FRA reportable injury frequency rate of 0.83 per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S4	Through the implementation of our safety program, we have reduced our injury frequency rate by 57% since 2006, when it was 1.95 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S5	For comparative purposes, from January 2017 through November 2017 , the most recent month for which FRA data is publicly available, the United States short line average reportable injury frequency rate was 2.46 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, and the United States regional railroad average was 3.14 injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S6	Based on these results, in 2017 , our operations were three times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S7	Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we monitor our reportable derailments worldwide in accordance with the guidelines established by the FRA.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P6_S8	Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable derailment frequency rate, defined as FRA reportable derailments per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.58 and 0.52 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers, and each of our local railroads is focused on exceeding customer expectations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	This customer commitment supports not only traffic growth, but also customer loyalty and new business development opportunities.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	To ensure the needs of our customers are addressed promptly, we employ technology-based service exception tools to monitor service information, communicate issues and track corrective actions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	We engage a leading independent customer-satisfaction research firm to conduct a biennial, comprehensive customer satisfaction survey.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	The survey results are used to measure our performance and develop continuous improvement programs.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P8_S3	Over the past ten years, we have outscored the trucking and railroad industries on each of our biennial customer satisfaction surveys.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	We generally build and operate each of our regions based on the local customer base within our operating geographies and seek to grow rail traffic through intensive marketing efforts to new and existing customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	As a result of the acquisition of RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) in 2012, Freightliner in 2015, GRail in 2016 and Pentalver Transport Limited (Pentalver) in 2017, we believe that our expanded footprint across North America, Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe provides us with greater visibility of new commercial and industrial development opportunities in these geographies that should help increase the success of our marketing efforts.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	Further, we believe that our relationship with MIRA, a recognized Australian infrastructure investor, will enable us to leverage our rail platform for future growth opportunities in Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P9_S3	We also pursue additional sources of revenue by providing ancillary rail services such as railcar switching, rolling-stock and shipping container repair, storage, cleaning, weighing and blocking and bulk transfer, which enables our customers and Class I carriers to move freight more easily and cost-effectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	We focus on running cost effective railroad operations and historically have been able to operate acquired rail lines more efficiently than they were operated prior to our acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	We typically achieve efficiencies by lowering administrative overhead by leveraging our regional structure, consolidating equipment and in-sourcing track maintenance, reducing transportation costs, selling surplus assets and reducing expenses associated with accidents and personal injuries through the implementation of our safety culture.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	We invest in track and rolling stock to ensure that we operate safe railroads that meet the needs of customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	At the same time, we seek to improve our return on invested capital by focusing on cost effective capital programs.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	For example, in our short haul and regional operations in North America, we typically rebuild older locomotives rather than purchase new ones and invest in track at levels appropriate for our traffic type and density.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	Further, in 2015, we formed a new entity, Railroad Engineering Services LLC, with experienced management and dedicated track engineering resources to enhance the productivity of our track and bridge capital programs.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S4	In addition, because of the importance of certain of our customers and railroads to their regional economies, we are able, in some instances, to obtain state, provincial and/or federal grants to upgrade track and other infrastructure.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S5	Typically, we seek government funds to support investments that otherwise would not be economically viable for us to fund on a stand-alone basis.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S6	To assist our local management teams, we provide administrative, commercial and operational support from corporate staff groups where there are benefits to be gained from scale efficiencies and centralized expertise.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S7	Our commercial group assists local management by providing assistance with regional pricing, origin and destination offerings across the Company, managing real estate revenue (including from land leases and crossing and access rights), industrial development project expertise, 24/7 customer service and Class I railroad relationship management.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S8	Our operations department assists with implementing our safety culture, conducting training programs, leveraging our scale in purchasing rail and rail-related equipment, ensuring efficient equipment utilization and service design, and providing mechanical, locomotive and bridge engineering expertise.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S9	In addition, we maintain other traditional, centralized functions, such as accounting, finance, legal, corporate development, government and industry affairs, human resources and information technology.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S10	Our acquisition and investment strategy includes the acquisition or long-term lease of existing railroads, as well as investment in rail equipment and/or track infrastructure to serve new and existing customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P11_S11	Most recently, in May 2017, we consummated the previously announced acquisition of Pentalver.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Pentalver operates off-dock container terminals, offers trucking haulage services and provides services related to container maintenance and repair.

1012620_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Since 2000, we have added 105 railroads through the execution of our acquisition and investment strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Historically, our acquisition, investment and long-term lease opportunities have been from the following five sources:
1012620_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Acquisitions of additional short line and regional railroads in the United States and Canada, such as the Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (Providence and Worcester Railroad) acquisition in 2016 and our acquisitions of Pinsly Railroad Company's (Pinsly) Arkansas Division (Pinsly Arkansas) in 2015, RailAmerica in 2012, Arizona Eastern Railway Company in 2011, CAGY Industries, Inc. in 2008, the Ohio Central Railroad System in 2008 and Rail Management Corporation in 2005.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Acquisitions of international railroads and transportation service providers, such as our acquisitions of Pentalver in 2017, London-based Freightliner in 2015, FreightLink Pty Ltd (FreightLink) in Australia in 2010 and Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V. (RRF) in the Netherlands in 2008.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Investments in track and/or rolling stock to support growth in new or existing areas of operations, such as the purchase of railcars in the United States in 2014 and 2015, our upgrade of the Chicago, Ft. Wayne Eastern Railroad to enhance Class I traffic flow east of Chicago and our September 2017 joint venture with SEACOR Holdings, Inc. to own and operate the CG Railway, LLC (CGR).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Acquisitions of operations from industrial or mining companies, such as our acquisitions of GRail from Glencore Coal Pty Limited in Australia on December 1, 2016 and the railroads owned by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 2003.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	When we make acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and reduce costs wherever possible and to implement best practices to increase the value of our investment, which is frequently accomplished through the elimination of duplicative overhead costs, implementation of our safety culture, improvements to operating plans, more efficient equipment utilization and enhanced customer service and marketing initiatives.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	In some cases, however, the best way to maximize the value of an investment is to increase expenditures at a new acquisition, such as for track upgrades, which improves customer satisfaction and drives additional revenue growth.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	In North America, we believe that our footprint of railroads provides opportunities to make contiguous short line railroad acquisitions due to a higher number of touchpoints with other railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	On a global basis, we believe that our scale, international experience and financial resources enhance our ability to compete for rail and ancillary business opportunities worldwide.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We have made a number of important railroad investments in North America and in various international markets, and we expect to continue to pursue our acquisition and investment strategy while adhering to our disciplined valuation approach.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	According to the AAR's 2017 Railroad Facts Book, there were 574 freight railroads in the United States operating over 138,400 miles of track.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	As described in the table below, the AAR classifies railroads operating in the United States into one of three categories based on an individual railroad's operating revenues (adjusted for inflation) and track miles operated.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	The following table shows the breakdown of freight railroads in the United States by classification:
1012620_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	(a) CSX Corp, BNSF Railway Co., Norfolk Southern Corp., Kansas City Southern Railway Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co., Canadian National Railway Co. and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	I railroads operate across many different states and concentrate largely, though not exclusively, on long haul, high density and intercity traffic lanes.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	The primary function of the regional and local railroads is to provide local service to rail customers and communities not located on the Class I railroad networks.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Regional railroads typically operate 400 to 650 miles of track and provide service to selected areas of the country, mainly connecting neighboring states and/or economic centers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	We refer to local railroads as short line railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Typically, local, or short line, railroads serve as branch lines connecting customers with Class I railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	Short line railroads generally have more predictable and straightforward operations as they largely perform point-to-point, light density service over shorter distances, versus the complex networks associated with the Class I railroads or larger regional railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	A significant portion of regional and short line railroad traffic is driven by carloads that are interchanged with other carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	For example, a Class I railroad may transport freight hundreds or thousands of miles from its origination point and then pass the railcar to a short line railroad, which provides the final step of service directly to the terminating customer.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The railroad industry in the United States has undergone significant change since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (Staggers Act), which effectively deregulated certain pricing and types of services provided by railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Following the passage of the Staggers Act, Class I railroads in the United States took steps to improve profitability and recapture market share lost to other modes of transportation, primarily trucks.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	In furtherance of that goal, Class I railroads focused their management and capital resources on their core long-haul systems, and some of them sold or leased branch lines to short line railroads, whose smaller scale and more cost-efficient operations allowed them to commit the resources necessary to meet the needs of customers located on those lines.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	Divestiture of branch lines spurred the growth in the short line railroad industry and enabled Class I railroads to minimize incremental capital expenditures, concentrate traffic density, improve operating efficiency and avoid traffic losses associated with rail line abandonment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	We operate two regional and 105 local (short line) railroads in the United States over approximately 15,800 miles of track, inclusive of approximately 3,200 miles of track that are owned or leased by others, which we operate through various trackage and operating rights agreements.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	According to Rail Trends 2017, published by The Railway Association of Canada (RAC), there are approximately 27,000 miles of track operated by railroads in Canada.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Similar to the United States railroad industry, freight railroads in Canada are also categorized as Class I railroads, regional railroads and short line railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	In Canada, there are two Class I railroads that are largely transcontinental carriers in Canada, with significant United States operations as well, several regional operators and approximately 50 short line railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	We operate eight local (short line) railroads in Canada over approximately 1,490 miles of track, inclusive of approximately 100 miles of track that are owned or leased by others, which we operate through various trackage and operating rights agreements.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	Australian Operations Australia has approximately 25,000 miles ( 40,000 kilometers (km)) of both publicly and privately owned track that link major capital cities and key regional centers and also connect key mining regions to ports.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Australian rail network comprises three track gauges: broad, narrow and standard gauge.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	There are three major interstate rail segments in Australia: the east-west corridor (Sydney, New South Wales to Perth, Western Australia); the east coast corridor (Brisbane, Queensland to Melbourne, Victoria); and the north-south corridor (Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	In addition, there are a number of intrastate rail freight networks servicing major agricultural and mining regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Australian rail freight transport industry is largely open access, which means that network owners and managers must provide access to the rail network to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and negotiation framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	The access rules generally include pricing principles and standards of use and are established by the applicable state or Commonwealth government.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Australian rail freight transport industry is structured around two components: train operations for freight haulage services (above rail) and rail track access operation and management (below rail).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	This contrasts with the North American freight rail industry where railroad operators almost always have exclusive use of the track that they own or lease.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	We are an accredited rail service provider in all mainland Australian states and in the Northern Territory.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Since Australian rail customers have access to multiple rail carriers under open access regimes, all rail carriers face possible competition on their above rail business from other rail carriers, as well as from competing modes of transportation, such as trucks.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	The open access nature of the Australian rail freight transport industry enables rail operators to develop new business and customer relationships in areas outside of their current operations, and there are limited barriers to entry that preclude any rail operator from approaching a customer to seek new business.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	However, shipments of bulk commodities in Australia are generally handled under long-term agreements with dedicated equipment that may include take-or-pay provisions and/or exclusivity arrangements, which make capturing new business from an existing rail operator difficult.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Through our Australian subsidiaries, we manage approximately 2,300 miles ( 3,700 km) of track in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which includes approximately 1,400 miles ( 2,200 km) of track between Darwin and Tarcoola that we manage pursuant to a concession agreement that expires in 2054, as well as approximately 900 miles ( 1,500 km) of track in South Australia that we manage pursuant to a lease that expires in 2047.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	Through the concession and lease agreements, we have long-term economic ownership of the tracks that we manage in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and we receive below rail access fees when other rail operators use the track we manage.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	In South Australia and the Northern Territory, our economic ownership of the tracks we manage, combined with our above rail operations, makes our Australian operations more similar to a typical North American railroad despite the open access environment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	In addition, through our acquisitions of Freightliner and GRail, we also have above rail operations in New South Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	According to Network Rail, the authority responsible for Great Britain s railway network, there are approximately 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of track owned and managed by it, and there are seven rail operators licensed for freight transport in Great Britain.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Great Britain s rail network is also open access, which means rail lines can be utilized by any licensed rail operator with an appropriate track access agreement in place.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	In the U.K.'s open access framework, the infrastructure managers must provide access to the rail infrastructure to all accredited rail service providers, subject to the rules and framework of each applicable access regime.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	As a result, U.K. rail freight customers have access to multiple rail carriers under the open access regime, and our operations face competition from both other rail freight carriers and other modes of transportation, such as road and water.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	In Great Britain, in 2016, 8% of all freight goods were moved by rail, while over the same period, 78% and 14% of goods were moved via road and water, respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Through our recent acquisition of Pentalver, we operate off-dock container terminals (most under long-term lease) strategically placed at each of the four major seaports of Felixstowe, Southampton, London Gateway and, until March 2018, Tilbury, as well as an inland terminal located at Cannock, in the U.K. Midlands, near many of the nation s largest distribution centers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	In addition to providing storage for loaded and empty containers on over 100 acres of land, Pentalver also operates a trucking haulage service with more than 150 trucks, primarily providing daily service between the seaports of Felixstowe and Southampton and its inland terminal at Cannock.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Pentalver also provides services related to container maintenance and repair (including refrigerated containers) and is one of the largest sellers of new and used containers in the U.K.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	The maritime container logistics industry in the U.K. is highly competitive, whether by road, rail or short-sea, with a premium placed on timely, efficient and safe service.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	We expect that the Pentalver acquisition will enable G W to (1) enhance its U.K. services by providing rail and road transportation solutions, as well as offering storage options at the ports and inland and (2) unlock efficiencies from shared services and enhanced asset utilization from Pentalver s trucking fleet and Freightliner s existing fleet of approximately 200 trucks that currently provide local collection and delivery haulage from Freightliner s inland terminals.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	According to Infrabel, the Belgian railways infrastructure manager, there are approximately 2,238 miles ( 3,602 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Belgian rail network, and currently there are 12 rail operators licensed for freight transport in Belgium.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	As a result of the country's open access regime, this track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	In Belgium, our subsidiary, Belgium Rail Feeding, operates mainly in the Port of Antwerp and on the main corridors towards the Netherlands and German boarders.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	The German rail network is composed of approximately 20,638 miles ( 33,214 km) of track.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	There are approximately 385 rail operators certified for freight transport in Germany.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	In Germany, as well as in other Continental European markets, the leading rail freight operators are often state controlled, such as DB Schenker in Germany.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P46_S3	As a result of Germany's open access regime, the rail infrastructure may be accessed by any licensed rail operator.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	A number of our subsidiaries operate in Germany.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	ERS Railways B.V. (ERS) operates intermodal routes from the Ports of Hamburg and Bremerhaven, among others.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	o. (Freightliner Poland) operates on the open access rail system within Poland with cross-border traffic into Germany.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P48_S2	RRF provides short-line rail services on the main corridors in Germany, and Freightliner DE GmbH (Freightliner Germany) operates on the open access rail system within Germany with cross-border traffic into Poland.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	According to ProRail, the entity responsible for the Dutch rail infrastructure, there are approximately 4,363 miles ( 7,021 km) of track owned and managed by it on the Dutch rail network.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	As a result of the open access regime in the Netherlands, this track may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	According to the trade association Rail Cargo Information Netherlands, there are 20 rail operators that provide rail freight services in the Netherlands.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	In the Netherlands, our subsidiary, RRF, operates mainly in the Port of Rotterdam and on the main corridors towards the German and Belgian borders.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our subsidiary, ERS, operates intermodal routes from the Port of Rotterdam.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	According to the Office of Rail Transport, the railway regulator in Poland, there are approximately 114 rail operators certified for freight transport in Poland operating over approximately 11,939 miles ( 19,214 km) of track.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	As a result of Poland s open access regime, this rail infrastructure may be accessed by any admitted and licensed rail operator.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	In Poland, our subsidiary, Freightliner Poland, operates on the open access network within Poland with some cross-border traffic into other neighboring countries.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	OPERATIONS Through our subsidiaries, we own or lease 122 freight railroads worldwide, including 105 short line railroads and two regional freight railroads in the United States, eight short line railroads in Canada, three railroads in Australia, one in the U.K., one in Poland and Germany and two in the Netherlands.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our subsidiaries provide freight rail service at more than 40 major ports in North America, Australia and Europe and perform contract coal loading and railcar switching for industrial customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our railroads operate over approximately 16,200 miles of track that are owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line in Australia that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	Also, through various track access arrangements, we operate over approximately 6,200 additional miles of track that is owned or leased by others.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	While our railroads are predominantly focused on freight service, certain of our railroads interact with passenger rail operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	The majority of our railroads in the U.K. and Continental Europe provide freight service that is commingled with passenger operations on third party track.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	In North America and Australia, it is not uncommon for passenger or excursion operators to provide service over our track.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, the Providence and Worcester Railroad provides freight service over track that is owned by a passenger operator in the United States and our Portland Western Railroad operates passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Freight Revenues We generate freight revenues from the haulage of freight by rail.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	Freight revenues represented 70.4% , 68.5% and 70.0% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our railroads transport a wide variety of commodities.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	For a comparison of freight revenues, carloads and average freight revenues per carload by commodity group for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , see the discussion under "Part II Item 7.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized either as interline or local traffic.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Interline traffic passes over the lines of two or more rail carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	It can originate or terminate with customers located along a rail line, or it can pass over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the traffic originating or terminating on the rail line (referred to as overhead traffic).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	Local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	Unlike overhead traffic, which has the potential to move from origin to destination without using our rail line, originating, terminating and local traffic in North America provides us with a more stable source of revenues because this traffic represents shipments to and/or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	In 2017 , revenues generated from originating, terminating and local traffic in North America constituted approximately 93% of our North American freight revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, railroads generally serve from origin to destination with few, if any, interline movements.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Freight-Related Revenues We generate freight-related revenues primarily from port terminal railroad operations and industrial switching (where we operate trains on a contract basis in facilities we do not own), trucking haulage services and container storage, as well as demurrage, storage, car hire, track access rights, transloading, crewing services, traction service (or hook and pull service that requires us to provide locomotives and drivers to move a customer's train between specified origin and destination points) and other ancillary revenues related to the movement of freight.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Freight-related revenues represented 24.1% , 26.8% and 25.1% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	All Other Revenues We generate all other revenues primarily from revenues from third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, container sales, property rentals and other ancillary revenues not directly related to the movement of freight.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	All other revenues represented 5.5% , 4.7% and 4.9% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Seasonality of Operations Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, either as a result of the nature of the commodity or its demand cycle.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	Seasonality is also reflected in our results of operations due to weather patterns.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	See Note 19 , Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited) , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Typically, we experience relatively lower revenues in North America in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in North America tend to reduce shipments of certain products, such as construction materials.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	Further, due to adverse winter conditions, we may also experience reduced shipments as a result of weather-related network disruptions and also tend to incur higher operating costs.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	In addition, we experience relatively lower revenues in Australia in the first quarter of each year as a result of the wet season (i.e., monsoonal rains in the Northern Territory).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	In the U.K./European operations, the intermodal business peaks in the late third and early fourth quarter of the year.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	We typically initiate capital projects in North America in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S5	Segment and Geographic Information For financial information with respect to each of our segments and geographic areas, see Note 18 , Segment and Geographic Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S6	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S7	Customers As of December 31, 2017 , our operations served approximately 3,000 customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S8	Revenues from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 24% , 22% and 22% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S9	Two of our ten largest customers in 2017 were located in Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S10	One operates in the agricultural and coal sectors, and the other operates in the iron ore mining sector.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S11	Three of our ten largest customers in 2017 were located in the U.K.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S12	Two of these customers are maritime shipping companies and the other is the infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in England, Scotland and Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S13	In North America, our largest customer represents less than 2% of our operating revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S14	In North America, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S15	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration, with terms generally ranging from less than one year to ten years.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P62_S16	These contracts establish a price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining a price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Generally, our freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	In Australia, we generally handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts directly with our customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	These contracts have terms as long as 20 years and generally contain a combination of fixed and variable pricing, with the fixed portion based upon the invested capital associated with the freight movement and the variable portion based on the actual volumes shipped.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	In the U.K. and Continental Europe, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us and the customer.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	These contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration from one to twelve years in the U.K. and one to two years in Poland.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	These contracts establish a price or a methodology to calculate the price.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	In some cases, the contracts provide for a minimum volume commitment by the customer and certain business is also conducted on a spot basis.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P64_S4	Our contracts will typically provide for a price adjustment to reflect any changes to particular elements of our cost base, such as fuel and track access charges.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P64_S5	In addition, Freightliner, as part of a British consortium, provides management and technical support for infrastructure and freight operations to Saudi Railway Company.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Saudi Railway Company is a government-owned company that is tasked with developing and operating railway services in Saudi Arabia.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	Employees There are various labor laws governing the countries in which we operate.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately 8,000 full-time employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S3	Of this total, approximately 4,200 employees were union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S4	Our operations have approximately 100 labor agreements with unions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S5	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to approximately 27 of those agreements and are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements with five newly represented bargaining units.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P65_S6	We are also a party to employee association agreements covering an additional 17 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	In Australia, Genesee Wyoming Australia Pty Ltd (GWA) has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	In the U.K., we have collective bargaining agreements with four recognized unions covering the majority of our employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	In Continental Europe, we have one collective bargaining agreement in Belgium, and other key locations have local work councils.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	We believe that we maintain positive working relationships with our employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P66_S4	The following table sets forth an approximation of union and non-union employees as of December 31, 2017 :
1012620_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	(a) Also includes employees that have employment terms and conditions determined by a labor agreement or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	SAFETY Our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of train accidents and personal injuries.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	Operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations, the transportation of hazardous materials, safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	In order to continuously improve our safety results, we utilize and measure various safety metrics, such as human factor incidents, that are instrumental in reducing our FRA reportable injuries.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S3	To monitor our safety performance, we apply the guidelines established by the FRA to all of our operations worldwide.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S4	Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable injury frequency rate, as defined by the FRA as reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.83 and 0.73 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S5	The average injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked for all United States short line railroads was 2.46 in 2017 (through November) and 2.75 in 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S6	Based on these results, in 2017 , our operations were approximately three times safer than the short line and regional railroad averages.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S7	Our safety program also focuses on the safety and security of our train operations, and we monitor our reportable derailments worldwide in accordance with the guidelines established by the FRA.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S8	Our operations achieved a consolidated reportable derailment frequency rate, defined as FRA reportable derailments per 200,000 man-hours worked, of 0.58 and 0.52 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S9	Further, we continue to utilize technology to analyze our track so as to prevent track-caused derailments.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S10	In addition, our information technology staff routinely assesses the security of our computer networks from cyber attacks.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P68_S11	To date, we have not experienced any material disruptions of our networks or operations due to cyber attacks.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our employees also strive to heighten awareness of rail safety in the communities where we operate through participation in governmental and industry sponsored safety programs, such as Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit organization that provides public education programs to prevent collisions, injuries and fatalities on and around railroad tracks and highway-rail grade crossings.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	During 2017 , employees of our railroads made approximately 391 Operation Lifesaver presentations focused on the dangers associated with highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing on railroad property.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	We also participate in safety committees of the AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	INSURANCE We maintain liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and accidents involving passengers and other third-party claims associated with our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P70_S2	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P70_S3	Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	The self-insured retentions under our insurance policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our Company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	COMPETITION Railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally highway competition from trucks and, on some routes and for certain commodities, ships, barges and pipelines.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required, as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	In North America, there normally is only one rail carrier directly serving a customer facility, while most freight is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	To the extent that highway competition is involved, the degree of that competition is affected by government policies with respect to fuel and other taxes, highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	In Australia, the U.K. and Continental Europe, our customers have access to other rail carriers under open access regimes, so we face competition from other rail carriers in addition to competition from competing modes of transportation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P75_S2	In addition, we also face competition from other companies that provide terminal and rail-related services.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P75_S3	To a lesser degree, there is also competition from similar products made in other areas where we are not located, a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P75_S4	For example, a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant as compared to its paper plants in other locations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	In some instances, we face product competition, where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes (e.g., coal we transport can compete with natural gas as a fuel source for electricity generation).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	We also face import competition, where commodities we transport face competition from less expensive imported products (e.g., steel).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	In addition, some of the products we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis (e.g., grain).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	In acquiring rail properties and making rail equipment and/or track infrastructure investments, we generally compete with other railroad operators and with various financial institutions, including infrastructure and private equity firms, operating in conjunction with rail operators.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Competition for rail properties and investment projects is based primarily upon price and the seller's assessment of the buyer's railroad operating expertise and financing capability.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	We believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and long-term operator of rail properties, our managerial and financial resources, as well as our commitment to safety and the communities in which we operate, position us well in a competitive acquisition and investment environment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	REGULATION North American Operations United States In addition to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses, our United States railroads are subject to regulation by:
1012620_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	some state and local regulatory agencies.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	The STB is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	Established by the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the STB has jurisdiction over, among other things, certain freight rates (where there is no effective competition), extension or abandonment of rail lines, the acquisition of rail lines and the consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	In limited circumstances, the STB may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	The FRA, DOT, OSHA and PHMSA have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, which include the regulation of equipment standards, track maintenance, handling of hazardous shipments, locomotive and railcar inspection, repair requirements, operating practices and crew qualifications.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	The TSA has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and may regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	Over the past five years, there have been various proceedings at the STB seeking to expand rail regulation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	The STB continues to evaluate the impact of "access" regulation that would impact railroads' ability to limit the access of other rail service providers to their rail infrastructure and has held hearings to assess the impact of changes to the access regime in the United States.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	Additionally, the preliminary results of a 2012 DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits were released in 2015, but data limitations hindered any changes to the federal truck size and weight limits.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	In 2018, we expect Congress to direct the DOT to develop a research plan to supplement the shortcomings of the earlier results.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	State departments of transportation have also launched initiatives seeking to increase truck size and weight limits at the state level.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	The outcome of these initiatives could impact regulation of railroad operations and prices for our rail services, which could undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	In 2010, the FRA issued rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which, following the passage by Congress of an extension in October 2015, generally is to be completed as early as December 31, 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P84_S3	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads are required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P84_S4	Our procurement and implementation of required PTC equipment is underway, and we expect to comply with the statutory installation deadlines.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P84_S5	However, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Canada Railroads that operate in more than one province are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules and the jurisdiction of the federal government.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	St. Lawrence Atlantic Railroad (Quebec), Ottawa Valley Railway, Southern Ontario Railway, Knob Lake Timmins Railway and the Goderich-Exeter Railway are federally regulated railroads in Canada that fall under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) and Transport Canada (TC) and are subject to the Railway Safety Act.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	The CTA regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways, financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies, all aspects of rates, tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S3	TC administers the Railway Safety Act, which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S4	Railways operating exclusively within one province are regulated by that province and must hold a Certificate of Fitness delivered by the appropriate provincial authority.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S5	Quebec Gatineau Railway and Cape Breton Central Nova Scotia Railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of Quebec and Nova Scotia, respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S6	In addition, Huron Central Railway is subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial government of Ontario.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P85_S7	Generally, construction, operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated by the provincial authorities, as are railway services.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	Acquisitions of additional railroad operations in Canada, whether federally or provincially regulated, may be subject to review under the Investment Canada Act (ICA), a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a Canadian business or establishment of a new Canadian business by a non-Canadian.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	In the case of an acquisition that is subject to review, a non-Canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ICA that the investment will be of net benefit to Canada, considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	Any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to Canada's Competition Act, which contains provisions relating to pre-merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	Australian Operations In Australia, we are subject to multiple regulatory regimes governing workplace health and safety, as well as rail safety, in each of the states and the one territory in which we operate.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	Regulation of rail safety is predominately governed by national legislation and administered by the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	Regulation of track access to nationally significant rail infrastructure is generally governed by federally legislated guidelines that are implemented by the states.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P87_S3	The state access regimes are required to be certified as effective access regimes by the Australian National Competition Council.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P87_S4	The regulatory oversight for the provision of rail infrastructure access is provided by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P87_S5	In addition, certain new acquisitions in Australia will also be subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board based on Australian national interest considerations and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on competition considerations.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	U.K./European Operations In the European Union (EU), several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by rail.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	These directives generally cover the development of railways, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	The EU legislation also sets a framework for a harmonized approach towards railway safety.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S3	Every railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the European network, and EU member states must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S4	These directives have been or will be implemented in legislation passed in each of the European countries in which we operate.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S5	Currently, each of the countries in which our U.K./European Operations segment operates is a member of the EU, and each one has adopted a similar regulatory regime consistent with European legislation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S6	EU law requires each member state to establish an overarching regulatory body for rail, independent in its organization, legal structure, funding and decision making that is also independent from any infrastructure manager.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P88_S7	The regulatory body ensures fair and non-discriminatory access to the rail infrastructure network and will often be responsible for monitoring competition in the rail services market, the licensing of rail operators and rail safety.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently, and any other bilateral trade agreements the U.K. can reach with other trade partners, as well as any changes to the regulation of rail.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	The rail infrastructure is owned and managed by the infrastructure manager who is responsible for maintaining and renewing the infrastructure as well as enhancements to the rail network.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	Access to the network is granted by the infrastructure manager through track access arrangements with licensed rail operators, with oversight by the regulatory body in certain EU countries.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	Currently, all of the infrastructure managers in the European countries in which we operate are owned or controlled by the respective governments in each country.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	The governments of each member state have ministries or departments dedicated to transport who are responsible for the long-term strategy, planning and funding of the transport infrastructure, including rail.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	These departments are also responsible for implementing European directives into domestic legislation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations, which frequently involve transporting hazardous materials.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	We are also indirectly affected by environmental laws that impact the operations of our customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	We believe our railroads operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements in all material respects.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	While we presently estimate that any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	North American Operations In the United States, these environmental laws and regulations, which are administered and implemented principally by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable state agencies, govern the management of hazardous wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P94_S1	The primary laws affecting our operations are: the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating water discharges.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P94_S2	As a result of our operations, we receive notices from time to time from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P94_S3	In November 2014, we received a notice from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P94_S4	Although the cleanup associated with this derailment is substantially complete, fines associated with the contamination have yet to be assessed and are not estimable.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	In Canada, environmental laws and regulations are administered at the federal level by Environment Canada and by the Ministry of Transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	In Australia, environmental laws and regulations are administered primarily by the Department of Environment at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state and territories level.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	Our railroads in Australia operate in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and agency agreements, of which we have two in Australia, one with the South Australian Environmental Protection Agency under EPA License 2933 and the other with the Northern Territory Environmental Protection Agency under EPL 222.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S3	Genesee Wyoming Australia is not currently required to be licensed in New South Wales but may be required to be licensed in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S4	Our South Australia and Northern Territory environmental protection licenses require us to provide annual returns demonstrating compliance with their operational and administrative conditions.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S5	They also have embedded in them conditions that require us to make certain notifications in the event of an occurrence that is likely to breach a condition of the licenses or the legislation.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S6	These conditions have been managed effectively to date with no notifications required.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P95_S7	Genesee Wyoming Australia is also obligated to report annually under the Commonwealth Government National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	The Commonwealth of Australia (Commonwealth) has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land that we acquired from them and used by our Australian Operations contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	Consequently, the Commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing South Australia environmental standards.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P96_S2	Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the implementation of remedial actions, the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or the termination of our lease.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	U.K./European Operations In the U.K., European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Environment Agency, along with local authorities and other related bodies.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and the Department for Transport (DfT).
1012620_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	In Belgium, European, national and local environmental policies are administered by the FPS Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	There is no principal environmental regulator in Germany.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	State authorities (usually district or county authorities), guided by their respective State Environmental Ministry, carry out day-to-day operational activities.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered by the Federal Railway Office.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	In the Netherlands, European, national and local laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level, whereas laws regulating the transportation of hazardous goods are primarily administered by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	The principal body responsible for environmental policy and law in Poland is the Ministry of the Environmental Protection, while the principal enforcement authority is the regional inspector for environmental protection.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	Regulations relating to the transportation of hazardous goods are administered by the President of the Rail Transport Office.
1012620_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	We were incorporated in Delaware on September 1, 1977.

1012620_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS Adverse global macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business, and changes in commodity prices could decrease demand for the transport of commodities.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Slower economic growth, an economic recession, significant changes in global economic conditions or commodity prices or import or export volumes or changes in government regulation could negatively impact our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For instance, lower prices of commodities, such as iron ore, coal and manganese, could be a factor influencing decisions to delay, cancel or suspend certain mining projects in Australia and elsewhere, which could reduce the demand for our services.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Further, if the rate of economic growth in Asia slows, the export coal carried by our railroads, particularly in Australia, could decline.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Agricultural commodity prices are also inherently susceptible to fluctuation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	For example, a decline in the price of corn that we transport may result in lower revenues for us if farmers decide to store such corn until the price increases.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If we experience significant decline in demand for our services with respect to one or more commodities or products, we may experience lower revenues, increased operating costs, workforce adjustments and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, we are required to assess for potential impairment of non-current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances, including economic circumstances, indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Given the asset intensive nature of our business, weakness in the general economy increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	A decline in current macroeconomic and financial conditions or commodity demand from changing patterns of economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	If we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments or manage our growth effectively, then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Our growth strategy is based in part on the selective acquisition and development of, and investment in, rail operations, both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things:
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	the receipt of government approvals and financial constraints or other restrictions that may be specific to the particular company or asset to be acquired.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We have experienced significant growth in the past, partially due to the acquisition of additional railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Effective management of rapid growth presents challenges, including the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses effectively, the need to expand our management team and staff when necessary, the need to enhance internal operating systems and controls and the ability to consistently achieve targeted returns on capital.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These challenges are more pronounced when we experience growth in numerous geographies and on a larger scale.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	As our business grows, we may not be able to maintain similar rates of growth in the future or manage our growth effectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our inability to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Integrating acquired businesses could also result in significant unexpected costs.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Further, the process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our existing business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors, among others:
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	the diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These disruptions and difficulties, if they occur, may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short- and long-term effects on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings, synergies, revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Expected savings and benefits are frequently based on due diligence results and on extensive analyses that involve assumptions as to future events, including general business and industry conditions, commodity trends, the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served and the associated revenues, the ability to negotiate acceptable contractual arrangements, including renewals of leases with other railroads or extensions of government subsidies, operating costs, competitive factors and the ongoing cost of maintaining track infrastructure, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	There is no guarantee that the due diligence results will be accurate or that we will not discover unanticipated liabilities.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Further, while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions are reasonable, they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, even if we achieve the expected benefits, we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Also, the cost savings and other benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unexpected costs incurred in integrating the companies, increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S8	For example, if key employees of acquired companies depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become our employees, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions could be reduced or delayed.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S11	These acquisitions, as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company, may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P5_S12	The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Generally, the representations made by the sellers, other than certain representations related to fundamental matters, such as ownership of capital stock, expire within several years of the closing.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A material liability associated with an acquisition, especially where there is insufficient right to indemnification, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions and investments.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we are unable to obtain this capital at a reasonable cost, then we may be required to forego potential opportunities, which would impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We intend to continue to review acquisition and investment opportunities and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	As in the past, we expect that we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of acquisitions and purchases that we make.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	In addition, from time to time, we may make investments in equipment and assets to support our customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Depending on the number of acquisitions and investments and funding requirements, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Instability or disruptions in the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access to the capital markets and could also increase our cost of capital.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S7	To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S8	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S10	If we are unable to obtain additional capital at a reasonable cost, we may be required to forego potential acquisitions, which could impair the execution of our growth strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Exposure to market risks, particularly changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and hedging transactions entered into to mitigate these and other risks could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	It is impossible to fully mitigate all such exposure, and higher interest rates and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	From time to time, we may use various financial instruments to reduce our exposure to certain market risks.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	For instance, we have entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk associated with floating interest rate payments under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	While these financial instruments reduce our exposure to market risks, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from lower interest rates or favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement and may have significant costs associated with early termination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our operations served approximately 3,000 customers in 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Revenues from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our operating revenues in 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In 2017, our largest customer served the agricultural and coal sectors in Australia, and accounted for approximately 6% or our operating revenues across all geographies.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In North America and in our intermodal business in the U.K. and Australia, we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us, our connecting carriers and the customer.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our contracts are generally in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	These contracts establish price or, in the case of longer term contracts, a methodology for determining the price, but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	As a consequence, there is rarely a guarantee that past volumes or revenues will continue in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Further, under these contracts, freight rates and volumes are not directly linked to changes in the prices of the commodities being shipped, and there is no customary contractual protection in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	For instance, one of our largest customers, Arrium Limited (Arrium), announced it had entered into voluntary administration in 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Although Arrium was sold to the GFG Alliance in 2017, a portion of Arrium's shipments and the associated revenue to GWA pursuant to contracts with Arrium ceased in 2015 and has not recommenced.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Substantial reduction in business with, or loss of, important customers or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our business is subject to credit risk.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	There is a risk that customers or counterparties, which include government entities related to grants and financial institutions related to derivative transactions, will fail to meet their obligations when due.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, shutdowns, operational failures or other reasons.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Over the last three years, several of our mining, metals and maritime shipping customers instituted insolvency proceedings.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In the United States, for interline traffic, one railroad typically invoices a customer on behalf of all railroads participating in the route.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The invoicing railroad then pays the other railroads their portion of the total amount invoiced on a monthly basis.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Therefore, when we are the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to customer credit risk for the total amount invoiced and are required to pay the other railroads participating in the route even if we are not paid by the customer.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Also, when we are not the invoicing railroad, we are exposed to credit risk at the customer and invoicing railroad levels.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition, we may make substantial investments in equipment and assets to support our customers, in particular for those in the mining and natural resources industry.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We usually enter into long-term contracts with these customers that include fixed and variable payment terms.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Under these contracts, the customers pay a fixed amount independent of actual volume shipped as well as a variable rate per ton shipped, with the fixed payment often representing the majority of the total contract payments.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Under these arrangements, we are exposed to start-up risks for new operations as well as ongoing operational risks, including exposure to mine shutdowns, that may reduce the variable payments, as well as customer insolvency risk that could impact our ability to collect our fixed payments.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	We have procedures for reviewing our receivables and evaluating credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties; however, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Certain of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S10	This information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S11	As a result, unexpected credit exposures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Because we depend on Class I railroads and other connecting carriers for a significant portion of our operations in North America, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The railroad industry in the United States and Canada is dominated by seven Class I carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In 2017 , approximately 81% of our total carloads in the United States and Canada were interchanged with Class I carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, Class I carriers also traditionally have been significant sources of business for us, as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	A decision by any of these Class I carriers to cease or re-route certain freight movements or to alter existing business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	The overall impact of any such decision would depend on which Class I carrier is involved, the routes and freight movements affected, as well as the nature of any changes.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition, our ability to provide rail service to customers in the United States and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to lease arrangements, freight rates, revenue divisions, fuel surcharges, car supply, reciprocal switching, interchange and trackage rights.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Deterioration in the operations of, or service provided by, those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are dependent on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties for our operations, strategy and growth.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In North America, our rail operations are dependent, in part, on lease agreements with Class I railroads and other third parties that allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We lease many of our railroads from Class I carriers and other third parties under lease arrangements with varied expirations, which railroads collectively accounted for approximately 11.3% of our 2017 total operating revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We also own several railroads that lease portions of the track or right-of-way upon which they operate from Class I railroads and other third parties.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that are subject to expiration in each of the next ten years represent 3% or less of our annual revenues in the year of expiration based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	For example, our revenues associated with leases from Class I railroads and other third parties subject to expiration in each of the next five years ( 2018 - 2022 ) would represent approximately 2.4% , 0.3% , 0.0% , 0.6% and 1.1% of our operating revenues in each of those years, respectively, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Expiration or termination of these leases or the failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our results of operations and rail infrastructure are susceptible to weather conditions and other natural occurrences.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, hurricanes (or cyclones), tornadoes, droughts, earthquakes and other natural occurrences.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, bad weather and natural disasters, such as blizzards in the United States or Canada and hurricanes (or cyclones) in the United States or Australia, and resulting floods, could cause a shutdown, derailment, washout or other substantial disruption of our operations and those of the entire freight rail network, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Weather impacts or other conditions that do not directly affect our operations can still impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our minerals and stone freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern United States, which lessen demand for road salt.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our coal and coke freight revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the United States or the U.K., which lessen demand for electricity, which in turn lessons the demand for coal.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our revenues generated from the transportation of agricultural products in North America and Australia are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions and the South Australian grain harvest is also susceptible to the impact of droughts or heavy rains and flooding in South Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Furthermore, our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather conditions, including, for example, higher track maintenance, overtime and diesel fuel costs in the winter at our railroads in the United States and Canada related to snow removal, mandated work breaks and locomotive idling.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Weather conditions could also cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Adverse weather conditions that disrupt the entire freight rail network can also cause traffic diversions, prolonged delays and equipment shortages that impact our ability to serve our customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The development of some of our business could be hindered if we fail to maintain satisfactory working relationships with partners in Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Following our acquisition of GRail, our Australian Operations are conducted through the Australia Partnership, in which we own a controlling 51.1% ownership interest and, therefore, include 100% of our Australian Operations within our consolidated financial statements with a 48.9% noncontrolling interest recorded to reflect MIRA's ownership.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	However, as a consequence of the partnership agreement, we do not have absolute control over the operations of the Australia Partnership.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Australia Partnership is governed by a management committee, which is comprised of representatives appointed by both MIRA and G W as general partners.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Certain matters require approval by both MIRA and us, including: (1) hiring and dismissing select executives of the partnership; (2) commitments relating to significant contracts or other matters; (3) approval of the partnership s strategic plan, which is a long-term plan outlining the expectations of MIRA and us for the business (including leverage, equity returns and capitalization); (4) mergers or consolidations; (5) incurrence of material indebtedness; (6) capital structure changes; (7) changes to the distribution policy; and (8) related-party transactions.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Accordingly, our ability to maintain constructive and cooperative relations with MIRA will be critical to our ability to implement our plans and expand our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Any failure to maintain satisfactory working relationships with MIRA or the need to dedicate significant management resources and time to align our interests with the interests of MIRA could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Furthermore, should we fail to maintain a controlling interest in the Australia Partnership, we will deconsolidate our Australian Operations and account for them under the equity method of accounting.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our Credit Agreement and our Australian Credit Agreement contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our Credit Agreement contains numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	enter into certain agreements containing negative pledges and upstream limitations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our Australian Credit Agreement contains comparable provisions that are applicable solely to our Australian business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, our Credit Agreement and the Australian Credit Agreement also contain financial covenants that require the borrowers under each agreement to meet financial ratios and tests.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Failure to comply with the obligations in our Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement and other debt agreements could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement or other debt agreements, as applicable, which, if not cured or waived, could permit lenders to accelerate the related indebtedness and foreclose on the assets securing such debt, if any.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have a significant amount of indebtedness.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had a total indebtedness of $2.3 billion , and we had unused commitments of $393.1 million under our Credit Agreement (after giving effect to $3.2 million of undrawn letters of credit that reduces such availability).
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, we had unused commitments of A$46.9 million under the Australian Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Subject to the limits contained in our Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following:
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	As a common carrier by rail, we are required to transport hazardous materials, regardless of cost or risk, which could result in material losses.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including toxic/poisonous inhalation hazard (TIH/PIH) materials, such as chlorine, crude oil and other dangerous substances that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Additionally, United States laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	A rail accident or other incident or accident on our railroads, at our facilities or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury, property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, insurance premiums charged for, or the self-insured retention associated with, some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these materials.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Also, federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads' transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations, which could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Further, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Such ordinances could require the re-routing of hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional costs.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Increases in costs associated with the transportation of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S9	We may be impacted by our inability to obtain government funding for capital projects or to benefit from revenue support grants.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S10	Certain of our existing capital projects are, and certain of our future capital projects may be, partially or completely funded through government grant programs.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S11	During 2017 , we obtained partial or complete funding by United States and Canadian federal, state, provincial and municipal agencies for 62 new projects.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S12	The net spending associated with these grant-funded projects represented approximately 4% of our net capital expenditures during 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S13	Government funding for projects is limited, and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal, state, provincial and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate funding availability or require us to accept onerous contractual obligations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S14	In certain jurisdictions, the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P30_S15	If we are unable to obtain adequate government funding, we may have to defer or forgo certain capital projects, incur additional debt or use additional cash.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our entities in the U.K. benefit from the U.K. Government administered Mode Shift Revenue Support Scheme (MSRS), which supports the movement of freight away from road, particularly in the container market.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	While the U.K. Government confirmed its continued funding of MSRS in 2017, the amount of the funding available for the periods subsequent to 2017 may be less than in prior years.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Reduced grants may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We purchase insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments, grade crossing accidents, collisions and other incidents or occurrences.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Unexpected or catastrophic circumstances associated with derailments of valuable lading, grade crossing accidents, collisions or other incidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials or other accidents involving our operations could cause our losses to exceed our insurance coverage limits or sub-limits or give rise to losses or penalties that are not covered by our insurance.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, on certain of the rail lines over which we operate, freight trains are operated over the same track as passenger trains.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For instance, in Oregon, our Portland Western Railroad operates passenger trains for the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon, our New England Central Railroad is also used by Amtrak for passenger service in New England, our Connecticut Southern Railroad operates over Amtrak trackage in Connecticut and the Providence and Worcester Railroad operates over MetroNorth Commuter Railroad trackage in New York and Connecticut and also operates over Amtrak trackage in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In Australia, The Ghan passenger train is operated by a third party over the track of GWA (North) Pty Ltd between Tarcoola and Darwin, and GRail operations also have touchpoints with the passenger network in New South Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Further, we operate excursion trains on behalf of third parties on certain of the rail lines over which we operate.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the U.K., Continental Europe and Australia, freight trains are primarily operated over the same track as passenger trains and will also regularly pass through passenger stations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Derailments, collisions or other incidents involving us and passenger or excursion trains could give rise to losses that exceed our insurance coverage.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Moreover, certain third-party freight and excursion train operators have contractual rights to operate over certain of our rail lines.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	These third-party operators generally are required to maintain specified levels of insurance coverage, but insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the losses arising from an incident involving such operators on our rail lines.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Also, insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers, and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at current levels or at all or obtain it on terms acceptable to us.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Deteriorating insurance market conditions caused by global property or rail liability losses, as well as subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly attributable to us, including such things as derailments, accidents, discharge of toxic or hazardous materials, or other like occurrences in the industry, may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and/or our self-insured retentions, volatility in our claims' expenses and limitations to the coverage under our existing policies and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	In addition, we are subject to the risk that one or more of our insurers may become insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Even with insurance, if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, we may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes to the legislative and regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations associated with new legislation, executive orders issued by the President of the United States and to a variety of health, safety, security, labor, environmental and other regulations by a significant number of federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	New rules or regulations mandated by these agencies could increase our operating costs.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	For example, the FRA rules governing the implementation of an interoperable positive train control system (PTC), which were amended in October 2015, require compliance as early as December 31, 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions to these PTC requirements for Class II and Class III railroads, including but not limited to, excepting from the PTC requirements trains traveling less than 20 miles on PTC-required track, and providing Class II and Class III railroads until 2020 to employ PTC-equipped locomotives.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Notwithstanding these exceptions, certain of our railroads are required to install PTC-related equipment by the end of 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S7	We expect to comply with the statutory installation deadlines.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P38_S8	However, non-compliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could undermine public confidence in us and subject us to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, there are various legislative and regulatory actions that have been considered in the United States in recent years to modify the regulatory oversight of the rail industry.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Various proceedings have been initiated by the STB related to rail competition, interchange commitments and competitive access.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	A DOT study on the impacts of a possible increase in federal truck size and weight limits commenced in 2012.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	The preliminary results of the DOT study were released in 2015, but data limitations hindered any changes to the federal truck size and weight limits.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In 2018, we expect Congress to direct the DOT to develop a research plan to supplement the shortcomings of the earlier results.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	State departments of transportation have also launched initiatives seeking to increase truck size and weight limits at the state level.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Many of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at Class I railroads; however, various legislative and regulatory initiatives being considered by Congress, the STB or other regulators could expand regulation of our railroad operations and undermine the economic viability of certain of our railroads, as well as threaten the service we are able to provide to our customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could also be significant.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In the other geographies in which we operate, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory authorities could change the regulatory framework (including the access regimes) or take actions without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes or actions could have on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution and business relationships with our customers and other railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Expanded regulation of our railroad operations will increase the cost of providing rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Currently, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in the U.K. is undertaking a periodic review which will determine Network Rail s costs and funding for the period from April 2019 to March 2024.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The periodic review could impact the network access charges which are paid by rail providers to Network Rail, as well as the performance and other compensation regimes that regulate the relationship between Network Rail and all rail operators.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The review could result in increased charges being paid by our operations for access to the rail network, along with increased performance payments and reduced compensation payments.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The ORR is expected to publish its draft decision in June 2018, with the final decision to be issued in December 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or changes to the regulatory regimes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, changes in the dynamics of global energy markets, including the closure of coal-fired power plants we serve, climate change litigation and climate change itself could adversely affect our operating costs, decrease demand for the commodities we transport and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Market and regulatory responses to climate change, as well as its physical impacts, could materially affect us.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	For example, federal, state and local laws, regulations, restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations to the extent they apply to our diesel locomotives, equipment, vehicles and machinery or our rail yards.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Further, restrictions on emissions could affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy, that use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or that manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including, for example, coal mining operations, natural gas producers, coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, automakers and other manufacturers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Significant cost increases, government regulation, changes in market dynamics or changes in consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S6	For instance, over the past few years, production of natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically, which has resulted in lower natural gas prices.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S7	As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S8	If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants in the United States could be displaced.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S9	Further, we carry significant coal volumes in Australia that are destined for export to Asia.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S10	A decrease in the demand for coal in the United States or Asia could further reduce our coal volumes and revenues, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P43_S11	Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Finally, we could face changes to our operations and decreased revenues associated with climate change.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may also experience increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change, including claims alleging that our operations have a negative impact on climate change.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any such market or regulatory responses or litigation, as well as physical impacts attributed to climate change and global warming, such as floods, rising sea levels, increasingly frequent and intense storms and any alteration of trade patterns, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the impacts discussed above or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We could incur significant costs for violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters, the generation handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous materials (including lading) or petroleum releases.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	We may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned, leased or operated by us, properties owned by third parties (for example, properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated, stored, spilled or disposed), as well as at properties currently owned, leased or operated by us, including from lading in the event of a derailment.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S7	For instance, we received a notice in November 2014 from the EPA requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of one of our trains in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P44_S8	While the cleanup associated with this derailment is substantially complete, fines associated with the contamination have yet to be assessed.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Under some environmental statutes, liability may be found without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be "joint and several," whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we (or the entity that gives rise to our liability) may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties, other third parties affected by environmental conditions (for example, contractors and current or former employees) seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or personal injury or death, and/or by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	While we maintain insurance for certain environmental damages and claims, environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs and expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination that may or may not be fully covered by our insurance.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Violations of, and liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We face competition from numerous sources, including those relating to geography, substitute products, other types of transportation and other rail operators.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In North America, each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In certain circumstances, including under the open access regimes in Australia and Europe, our customers have direct access to other rail carriers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation, principally trucks and, on some routes, ship, barge and pipeline operators.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Transportation providers such as trucks and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while we must build and maintain our own network infrastructure.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Competition for our services could increase if other rail operators build new rail lines to access certain of our customers or grant to other rail carriers access rights to our rail lines or if legislation is passed that provides materially greater latitude for trucks with respect to size or weight restrictions or automation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	We are also subject to geographic and product competition.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S6	A customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Also, commodities that are not transported by rail could be substituted for another commodity that we transport by rail.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S8	For example, natural gas can compete with coal that we transport as a fuel source for electricity generation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S9	In either case, we could lose a source of revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S10	In addition, we are subject to import competition, where commodities that we transport face competition from less expensive imported products.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P48_S11	Some of the products that we transport are exported and face competition on a global basis.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The extent of competition varies significantly among our railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Competition is based primarily upon the rate charged, the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Because a significant portion of our carloads in the United States and Canada involve interchange with another carrier, we have only limited control over the total price, transit time or quality of such service.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	It is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business, since not only each customer, but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	However, changes to the competitive landscape could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S6	We may be adversely affected by diesel fuel supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets and increases in diesel fuel costs.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P49_S7	We consumed 71.6 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2017 and 68.0 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war, terrorist attack or otherwise, diesel fuel may not be readily available and may be subject to rationing regulations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In addition, diesel fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Currently, we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset fuel prices, although there may be a significant delay in our recovery of fuel costs based on the terms of the fuel surcharge program.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	If Class I railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges, the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease, which could have a negative effect on our profitability.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Costs for fuel used in operations were approximately 8% and 7% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically from production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports or domestic oil production or otherwise, these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S7	We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S8	The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, environmental contamination, freight loss, property damage, contract claims and other matters.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S9	For example, United States job-related personal injury claims by our railroad employees are subject to the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) which is applicable only to railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S10	FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P50_S11	The variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	From time to time, we also have various contractual disputes with interchange partners and customers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving material freight loss or property damage, personal injury or environmental liability against us or monetary damages associated with a breach of contract or other claims that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Some of our employees belong to labor unions, and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we were a party to approximately 100 collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States, Australia, Canada and U.K./Europe.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to approximately 27 of these agreements, and are currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements with five newly represented bargaining units.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	Approximately 4,200 of our approximately 8,000 full time employees are either union members or have employment terms and conditions determined by labor agreements or negotiated by a labor union or works council.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In addition, we have 91 employees who have elected to have union representation and are in the process of negotiating their first collective bargaining agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	We also have entered into employee association agreements with an additional 17 employees who are not represented by a national labor organization.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	GWA has six collective enterprise bargaining agreements covering the majority of its employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In the U.K./Europe we have various collective bargaining agreements, as well as agreements with local work councils.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	A substantial majority of the employees of the Class I railroads with which we interchange are unionized.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	If such Class I railroads were to have a work slowdown or strike, the national rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In the U.K., our operations are reliant on the rail infrastructure provided by Network Rail.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	A majority of Networks Rail s employees are unionized, and if Network Rail were to have a work stoppage or strike, the U.K. rail network and our operations would be adversely affected.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of qualified workers, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S4	We believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers who possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S5	The operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh and remote conditions, resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S6	The challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce, training requirements and significant competition for specialized trades.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Within the next five years, we estimate that approximately 9% of our current workforce will become eligible for retirement based on an average retirement age of 61.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Many of these workers hold key operating positions, such as conductors, engineers and mechanics.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S9	In addition, the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased, especially from Class I railroads, which can usually offer higher wages and more generous benefits.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P54_S10	A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The execution of our growth strategy, in particular our acquisition and investment strategy, is substantially dependent on our senior management team.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	We rely on our senior management team to execute our growth strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Our growth strategy is different than the strategy of many other railroads because of our acquisition and investment focus.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S3	We may not be able to attract and retain senior leadership necessary to manage and grow our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Our performance significantly depends upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group, and our ability to retain and motivate them.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Our officers and key personnel have many years of experience with us and in our industry and it may be difficult to replace them.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S6	Further, the loss of any executive officers or key employees could require the remaining senior leadership to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P55_S7	The loss of the services of any of our senior leadership, and the inability to find a suitable replacement, could adversely affect our operating, acquisition and investment strategies, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting as well as disclosure controls and procedures, we could become subject to regulatory scrutiny and current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our management s report and an independent registered public accounting firm's report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As we execute our acquisition strategy, consistent with the guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may elect to omit an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of a recently acquired business in the year of acquisition from management's report.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Recently acquired businesses are required to be included in our assessment of internal control over financial reporting no later than in the year subsequent to the acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	As a result, to the extent we delay the assessment of an acquisition, there may be a delay in identifying and reporting control issues.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	The failure to implement and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, as well as disclosure controls and procedures, could result in our identification of material weaknesses in our financial reporting controls that may cause errors in our financial statements that could have a material effect on our financial results, financial position or liquidity and in the accompanying footnote disclosures.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S5	Such errors could also require restatements of previously issued financial statements.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S6	We may be unable to identify and report any material weaknesses on a timely basis in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P57_S7	Should such events occur, we may become subject to regulatory scrutiny and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and disclosure, which could negatively impact our stock price.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars, locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high barriers to entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as railcars, locomotives and track materials.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S2	If the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars either through lease or purchase increases, we might not be able to obtain railcars on favorable terms, or at all, and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In some cases, we use third-party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers and such locomotives may not be available.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Without these third-party locomotives, we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Even if purchased, there is no guarantee that locomotives would be available for delivery without significant delay.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S6	For example, in Australia, the availability of new wagons is limited, with long lead times for delivery.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S7	Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P58_S8	Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in equipment shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could limit our ability to support new projects and achieve our growth strategy.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We may be affected by acts of terrorism or anti-terrorism measures.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our rail lines, port operations and other facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In addition, regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We rely on the stability and availability of our technology systems to operate our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	The performance and reliability of our technology systems, as well as those provided by critical vendors, is critical to our ability to operate, compete safely and effectively improve our efficiency.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	A cyber security attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or sensitive information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties, thereby impacting our efficiency and damaging our corporate reputation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Such an event could result in increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including security costs to protect our infrastructure.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P60_S5	A disruption or compromise of our information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS We are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Some of our subsidiaries provide service and transact business in foreign countries, namely in Australia, Canada, the U.K., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, the Marshall Islands and China.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The risks of doing business in foreign countries include:
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Because some of our subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We have operations in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and Europe.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (including, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Polish zloty) and then translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average exchange rate for the statement period.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, Freightliner, as part of a British consortium, provides management and technical support for infrastructure and freight operations to Saudi Railway Company.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The Saudi Railway Company is a government-owned company established in 2006 that is tasked with developing and operating railway services in Saudi Arabia.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Payments under the contract are made in Saudi riyal and are converted into British pounds and included in our consolidated operating income in our U.K./European Operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar can impact our consolidated results of operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The exchange rates between these currencies and the United States dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Moreover, foreign governments may restrict transfers of cash out of the country and control exchange rates.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We may not be able to repatriate our earnings, and at exchange rates that are beneficial to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We may not be able to manage our exchange rate risks effectively, and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P66_S4	In addition, because our financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars, such fluctuations may affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our concession and/or lease agreements in Australia could be canceled, and these agreements may not be extended beyond their terms.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Through our subsidiaries in Australia, we have entered into long-term concession and/or lease agreements with governmental authorities in the Northern Territory and South Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Our concession agreement for the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line expires in 2054, and our lease agreement for our other South Australia rail lines expires in 2047.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	If our concession or lease agreements expire, we will no longer act as the below rail access provider but will still be permitted to participate in the above rail market.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	These concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions, including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to service, price and the environment.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	These concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures, which may require capital expenditures that are in excess of our projections.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Our failure to meet these commitments under the long-term concession and lease agreements could result in the termination of those concession or lease agreements.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	The termination of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our investment relating to that concession or lease agreement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Open access regimes in Australia and Europe could lead to additional competition for rail services, disruption to service and decreased revenues and profit margins.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The legislative and regulatory framework in Australia allows third-party rail operators to gain access to our Australian railway infrastructure and also governs our access to track owned by others.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	European countries in which our subsidiaries operate also have open access regimes that permit third-party rail operators to compete for the business of our subsidiaries that operate in such countries.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	There are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching our customers and seeking to capture their business.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Further, the open access nature of the rail network could lead to disruptions to services as infrastructure maintenance and scheduling operations are outside our control.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The loss of our customers to competitors or unexpected disruptions in service could result in decreased revenues and profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Changes to the open access regimes in Australia and Europe could have a significant impact on our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Access fees paid for our access onto the track of other companies and access fees we charge under state and federal regimes are subject to change.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Where we pay access fees to others, if those fees were increased, our operating margins could be negatively affected.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S6	In Australia, if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third-party rail freight operators by our Australian railroads did not meet competitive standards, our income from those fees could decline.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S7	In the U.K., if the ORR, the independent safety and economic regulator for Britain's railways, were to change the access regime, even if we were able to pass any increased fees onto customers, we may be less competitive and our revenues could decline.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S8	In addition, when we operate over track networks owned by others, the owners of the networks are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S9	Therefore, in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others, our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S10	Changes to the open access regimes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P72_S11	Revocation of our safety accreditations could result in a loss of revenue and termination of our concession.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Our operating subsidiaries in Australia and U.K./Europe hold safety accreditations that are required in order for them to provide freight rail services.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	These safety accreditations are essential for us to conduct our business and are subject to removal.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Following significant derailments, the government entities responsible for oversight of rail safety frequently perform investigations to supplement their annual and spot audit inquiries.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Any loss of, failure to maintain or inability to renew, rail safety accreditations necessary to carry on rail operations in any jurisdiction, or any changes in government policy and legal or regulatory oversight, including changes to the rail safety regulatory regime, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We have significant pension funding obligations under our U.K. Pension Program We provide a defined benefit pension program for our U.K. employees through a standalone shared cost arrangement within the Railways Pension Scheme (Pension Program).
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The Pension Program has more than 300,000 active and retired employees, and participation by more than 150 rail companies with assets under management of approximately 25 billion .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	There are six discrete sections within the Pension Program, and participating employers may set up more than one arrangement in the program.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	There is no cross-subsidy or funding obligation between the discrete sections of the Pension Program or between the discrete arrangements of any participating employers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The Pension Program is managed and administered by a professional pension administration company and is overseen by trustees with professional advice from independent actuaries and other advisers.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our section of the Pension Program is a shared cost arrangement with required contributions shared between us and our employees with our contribution being 60% and the remaining 40% contributed by active employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The Pension Program's assets are subject to market fluctuation, and its assets and liabilities are formally valued on an independent actuarial basis every three years.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	A key element of the valuation process is an assessment of the creditworthiness of the participating employer.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Less creditworthy employers are encouraged to invest in lower risk assets, with on average lower returns, which impacts the assessment of the pension liabilities and any underlying deficit.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	In the event that our section of the Pension Program is underfunded on an actuarial basis at any valuation point, the shared cost nature of the program means that we are responsible for paying 60% of any deficit contributions, with active employees contributing the remaining 40%, in each case over a recovery period agreed with the trustees.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	If our section of the Pension Program is terminated and wound up, any deficit would fall entirely on us and would not be shared with active employees.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S4	Equally, if all active employees were to leave our section, we would have full responsibility for funding any deficits.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S5	As of December 31, 2017 , there were approximately 1,500 active employees in our section of the Pension Program.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S6	Our pension expense and funding of our section of the Pension Program may increase in the future and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P81_S7	Political and economic uncertainty arising from a majority of voters approving a referendum for the United Kingdom to exit the European Union could adversely impact our operations and financial results.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	As a result of the referendum, the U.K. Government is currently negotiating with the EU Commission on the precise terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the EU.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Our U.K./European Operations represented approximately 28% of our consolidated revenues in 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the weakening of the British pound against the United States dollar.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	During periods of a weakening British pound, our reported international revenues are reduced because the British pound translates into fewer United States dollars.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently, and any other bilateral trade agreements the U.K. can reach with other trade partners.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Any of the potential effects of Brexit could have unpredictable consequences for credit markets and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	RISKS RELATED TO TAXATION United States federal income tax reform could adversely affect us.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA) was enacted into law.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to United States federal income taxation including, but not limited to: (1) reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) changing from a worldwide taxation system to a territorial tax system and providing a 100% dividends received deduction for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries; (3) creating new limitations on deductions for interest expense and officer compensation; and (4) requiring certain income of foreign subsidiaries directly or indirectly derived from intangible assets to be subject to United States federal income tax.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	The TCJA also imposes a one-time transition (toll) tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	To address the application of the TCJA on accounting for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date, the Securities and Exchange Commission's staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118).
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	SAB 118 provides for an up to one-year measurement period during which the tax effect of the TCJA can be recomputed based on additional guidance and analysis.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In accordance with SAB 118, we determined a reasonable estimate of the effects of the TCJA and have recorded provisional amounts in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S3	Given the significant complexity of the TCJA, anticipated guidance from the Internal Revenue Service about implementing the TCJA, the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the TCJA and our ongoing analysis thereof, which could result in changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, these estimates may be adjusted, which could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S4	In accordance with SAB 118, we expect to complete our assessment of the impact of the TCJA and record applicable adjustments in 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S5	The United States Short Line Tax Credit was renewed in February 2018 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P87_S6	If this credit is not extended, our effective tax rate in future periods will be higher.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Since 2005, we have benefited from the effects of the United States Short Line Tax Credit, which is an income tax credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Qualified expenditures include amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures, owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	The credit is equal to 50% of the qualified expenditures, subject to an annual limitation of $3,500 multiplied by the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by the Class II or Class III railroad as of the end of its tax year.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	The Short Line Tax Credit was initially enacted for a three-year period, 2005 through 2007, and was subsequently extended a series of times with the last extension enacted in February 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S4	The February 2018 extension provided a retroactive credit, solely for fiscal year 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S5	Legislation is currently pending that seeks to extend the Short Line Tax Credit for fiscal year 2018 and beyond.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S6	There is no guarantee that the Short Line Tax Credit will be extended again.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P88_S7	If the Short Line Tax Credit is not extended for additional tax years, or is modified prospectively, or the benefit derived from the credit is not replaced otherwise, the loss or a reduction of the credit will increase our tax rate and reduce our earnings per share.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were to be distributed, our effective tax rate could be higher.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of their respective countries.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S3	The amount of accumulated foreign earnings that have not been distributed was $237.9 million as of December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S4	These earnings have been subject to United States federal income tax via the estimated toll tax required by the TCJA.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S5	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may result in foreign exchange gains or losses and be subject to other taxes and credits, including U.S. state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries, which could result in a higher effective tax rate for us, thereby reducing our earnings.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P89_S6	No provision is made for the impact of those future foreign exchange gains or losses or such other potential taxes and credits that could be applicable to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the event of distribution.

1012620_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of the shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	It is possible that we are a United States real property holding corporation currently or will become one in the future for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If we are or become a United States real property holding corporation, so long as our Class A Common Stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, only a non-U.S. holder (i.e., a holder that is not a United States citizen or resident, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and certain trusts and estates) who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period) more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our Class A Common Stock, by reason of our status as a United States real property holding corporation.
1012620_18_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The rail properties that we own and operate in North America typically consist of the track and the underlying land.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Real estate adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way is generally owned by others, and our holdings of such real estate are not material.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Further, unless we own the rail properties outright, we do not normally control mineral rights or the ability to grant fiber optic and other easements in the properties.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Several of our railroads are operated under leases or operating licenses in which we do not assume ownership of the track or the underlying land.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	Further, under open access regimes as more fully described under "Part I Item 1.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	Business," the track may be accessed by any operator admitted and licensed to provide freight transport in the country.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	Our railroads operate over approximately 16,200 miles of track that is owned, jointly owned or leased by us, which includes the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line that we manage under a concession agreement that expires in 2054.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	Several of our railroads are operated pursuant to lease agreements that will expire in the next few years and may not be extended.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P2_S2	Leases from Class I railroads and other third parties that could expire in each of the next ten years would represent 3% or less of our annual revenues in the year of expiration, based on our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM2_P2_S3	For additional information on these lease expirations, see "Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	We also operate, through various trackage and operating rights agreements, over approximately 6,200 additional miles of track that are owned or leased by others under contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P3_S1	The track miles listed below exclude approximately 2,120 miles of sidings and yards ( 1,870 miles in the United States, 170 miles in Canada and 80 miles in Australia).
1012620_18_ITEM2_P3_S2	Track miles owned by others, but available to us, under open access regimes in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.K. are also excluded.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	We have recorded mortgages on many of the owned properties located in the United States and described in the table below as additional security for our outstanding obligations under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P4_S1	For additional information regarding our Credit Agreement, see Note 8 , Long-Term Debt , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P4_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P4_S3	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our railroads as of December 31, 2017 :
1012620_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	The original GNWR consisted of 14 miles and acquired an additional 13 miles in 1982.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P5_S1	The GNWR and DMM are now operated by RSR.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P5_S2	(e) PW operates over approximately 300 additional miles of track through contractual track access arrangements.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P5_S3	(f) We initially invested in South Australia in 1997; contributed our holdings to our Australian Railroad Group Pty. Ltd. (ARG) joint venture in 2000; upon sale of our interest in ARG in 2006, we re-acquired our contributed holdings, which were renamed GWA.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P5_S4	FLA has been the rail operator of GRail since its inception in 2010.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P6_S0	EQUIPMENT As of December 31, 2017 , our rolling stock consisted of 1,340 locomotives, of which 1,142 were owned and 198 were leased, and 30,263 railcars, of which 8,594 were owned and 21,669 were leased.
1012620_18_ITEM2_P6_S1	A breakdown of the types of railcars owned and leased by us as of December 31, 2017 is set forth in the table below:
1012620_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	In November 2014, we received a notice from the United States Environmental Protection Agency requesting information under the Clean Water Act related to the discharge of crude oil as a result of a derailment of an Alabama Gulf Coast Railway LLC (AGR) freight train in November 2013 in the vicinity of Aliceville, Alabama.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	A fine associated with the contamination has not yet been assessed and is not estimable.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are also involved in several arbitrations related to contractual disputes that are not covered by insurance.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	In March 2017, CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) initiated arbitration against several of our subsidiaries associated with freight revenue factors (or divisions) under certain operating agreements associated with leased railroads.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	CSXT is seeking to reduce certain of our freight revenue factors for the time period after August 21, 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	We believe we have meritorious defenses against the CSXT claims.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	In an unrelated matter, on May 3, 2017, the AGR initiated arbitration related to the collection of outstanding liquidated damages under a volume commitment (or take-or-pay) contract with a customer.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	We believe we will prevail in the collection of approximately $13 million of outstanding liquidated damages.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P3_S2	Although we expect to attain successful outcomes in each of these matters, arbitration is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable ruling could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P3_S3	Management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any probable liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits and the aforementioned arbitrations.
1012620_18_ITEM3_P3_S4	Based upon currently available information, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or arbitration would be material to our results of operations or have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The tables below present quarterly information on the price range of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	This information indicates the high and low closing sales prices for each recent fiscal quarter in the last two years as reported by the NYSE.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Our Class B Common Stock is not publicly traded.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Number of Holders On February 22, 2018 , there were 137 Class A Common Stock record holders and 11 Class B Common Stock record holders.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S1	Dividends We did not pay cash dividends to our Class A or Class B common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S2	We do not intend to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future and intend to retain earnings, if any, for future operation and expansion of our business.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S3	Any determination to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S4	For more information on contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, see "Part II Item 7.

1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S7	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities On November 22, 2017, we issued 238,201 shares of our Class A Common Stock upon buyout of our deferred consideration agreements with certain former management shareholders of Freightliner.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S8	The issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act).
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S9	These shares are restricted from trading by contract and are subject to the holding periods required by Rule 144 under the Act.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S10	We did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of these shares.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S11	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P2_S12	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report for additional information regarding the buyout of the Freightliner deferred consideration.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) The 17,806 shares acquired in the three months ended December 31, 2017 represent Class A Common Stock acquired by us from our employees who surrendered shares in lieu of cash to either fund their exercise of stock options or to pay taxes on stock-based awards made under our Third Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
1012620_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	On September 29, 2015, in conjunction with Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of our Class A Common Stock and appointed a special committee of the Board of Directors to review and approve repurchases proposed by management.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	Because of variations in the structure, timing and size of acquisitions and dispositions, our results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our results of operations in other reporting periods.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	For financial information with respect to our principles of consolidation and basis of presentation, see Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and for a complete description of our most recent acquisitions and dispositions, see Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in each case, included within "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	On May 3, 2017 , our subsidiary, GWI UK Acquisition Company Limited, purchased for cash all of the issued share capital of Pentalver for 97.8 million (or $126.2 million at the exchange rate on May 3, 2017 ) or 77.5 million (or $100.1 million ) net of cash received of 20.2 million (or $26.1 million ).
1012620_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	On May 31, 2017 , we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Atlantic Western Transportation, Inc., the parent company of Heart of Georgia Railroad, Inc. (HOG), for $5.6 million in cash and contingent consideration valued at $5.7 million .
1012620_18_ITEM6_P1_S2	In addition, we recorded a $371.9 million estimated tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P1_S3	We also bought out the Freightliner deferred consideration in November 2017 and recorded an $8.9 million gain on the buyout, which was included within other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P1_S4	In addition, during 2017 we incurred $11.9 million of corporate development and related costs and $10.2 million of restructuring costs, as well as $4.9 million of impairment and related charges primarily associated with the write down of track assets on idle branch lines in South Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	(b) On November 1, 2016 , we completed the acquisition of Providence and Worcester Railroad for $126.2 million .
1012620_18_ITEM6_P2_S1	On December 1, 2016 , one of our Australian subsidiaries completed the acquisition of GRail for A$1.14 billion (or approximately $844.9 million at an exchange rate of $0.74 for one Australian dollar) and concurrently issued a 48.9% equity stake in GWAHLP, which is the holding entity for all of the Company s Australian businesses, including GRail, to MIRA.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P2_S2	On December 13, 2016 , we completed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at $75.00 per share and received net proceeds of $ 285.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P2_S3	In addition, we incurred impairment and related charges of $57.3 million , including $21.5 million related to our ERS business in Continental Europe, $21.1 million related to the impairment of our rolling stock maintenance facility and associated write-off of accounts receivable resulting from an iron ore customer in Australia entering voluntary administration and $14.7 million charges related to leases of idle excess U.K. coal railcars, as well as $26.6 million of corporate development and related costs.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P2_S4	(c) On January 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Pinsly Arkansas for $41.3 million in cash.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	On March 25, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, for total consideration of 516.3 million (or $769.1 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	In addition, we incurred $15.3 million of acquisition/integration costs primarily associated with Freightliner and recorded a loss of $18.7 million on the settlement of foreign currency forward purchase contracts during 2015, which were entered into in contemplation of the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	(d) On May 30, 2014, our new subsidiary, Rapid City, Pierre Eastern Railroad, Inc. (RCP E), purchased the assets of the western end of CP's DM E rail line for a cash purchase price of $218.6 million , including the purchase of materials and supplies, railcars, equipment and vehicles.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P3_S3	(e) On February 13, 2013, we exercised our option to convert all of the outstanding Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued to Carlyle Partners V, L.P. (collectively, Carlyle) in conjunction with the RailAmerica acquisition into 5,984,232 shares of our Class A Common Stock.
1012620_18_ITEM6_P3_S4	On the conversion date, we also paid to affiliates of Carlyle cash in lieu of fractional shares and all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A-1 Preferred Stock totaling $2.1 million .
1012620_18_ITEM6_P3_S5	In addition, we incurred $17.0 million of integration and acquisition-related costs associated with RailAmerica during 2013.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	When comparing our results of operations from one reporting period to another, it is important to consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to acquisitions, changing economic conditions, commodity prices, competitive forces, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, rail network congestion, one-time freight moves, fuel price fluctuations, customer plant expansions and shutdowns, sales of property and equipment, derailments and weather-related conditions, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, high winds, droughts, heavy snowfall, unseasonably hot or cold weather, freezing and flooding, among other factors.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	In periods when these events occur, our results of operations are not easily comparable from one period to another.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Finally, certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions, global commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, such as steel products, iron ore, paper products, lumber and forest products and agricultural products, as well as product specific market conditions, such as the availability of lower priced alternative sources of power generation (coal) and energy commodity price differentials (crude oil and natural gas liquids).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	Other shipments are relatively less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors, such as winter weather (salt) and seasonal rainfall (agricultural products).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	As a result of these and other factors, our results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to our results of operations in other reporting periods.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	When we discuss foreign exchange impact, we are referring to the change in our results due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	We calculate foreign exchange impact by comparing the prior period results translated from local currency to United States dollars using current period exchange rates to the prior period results in United States dollars as reported.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Constant currency, which is a non-GAAP measure, reflects the prior period results translated at the current period exchange rates.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	When we discuss results from existing operations or same railroad operations, we are referring to the change in our results, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Outlook for 2018 Financial Expectations We expect consolidated revenues to grow approximately 8% in 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Operating income is also expected to grow, primarily due to same railroad growth, the impact of the Pentalver Transport Limited (Pentalver) acquisition as well as operating improvement worldwide.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	In North America, we expect revenues to increase approximately 4% in 2018, due to higher freight pricing as well as improved traffic across most commodity groups.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	We expect North American operating income to increase, primarily due to incremental margins on higher revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	In Australia, we expect revenues to increase approximately 7% in 2018, largely due to increases in export coal shipments, partially offset by lower agricultural products due to a weaker 2017-18 harvest and lower metallic ores revenues due to the suspension of operations at a mine that is evaluating a major expansion project.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	The increase in Australian coal revenues is expected to be supported by the delivery of additional rail cars in mid-2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S6	We expect Australian operating income to increase in 2018, primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by increasing expenses as we enhance our commercial and operational platform for future growth.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S7	Finally, in our U.K./Europe segment we expect revenues to increase approximately 21% in 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S8	The major components underlying the expected U.K./Europe revenue growth include contributions from the Pentalver acquisition, improved intermodal shipments due to better U.K. port fluidity and higher aggregates volumes, partially offset by a decline in U.K. coal volumes.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S9	Revenues are also expected to increase given the recent appreciation of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S10	U.K./Europe operating income is expected to significantly increase in 2018 due to the Pentalver acquisition and same railroad revenue increases, as well as cost reductions and increased operating efficiency.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S11	We expect our consolidated annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 27% for 2018, primarily driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA), which reduced the United States federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S12	We expect to make capital investments totaling $255 million in 2018 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S13	Of this total, $200 million is planned for ongoing railroad track and equipment capital and $15 million is planned for matching capital spending associated with government grant funded projects in the United States.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S14	We expect to spend an additional $40 million on new business investments, which include track projects, equipment purchases and investments in new facilities.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P3_S15	Our capital plan excludes acquisitions and new business development projects that are identified during the year.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Corporate and Business Development We continue to evaluate a number of potential projects located in all of the geographic markets in which we currently operate and elsewhere around the world.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Overview We own or lease 122 freight railroads worldwide that are organized in nine operating regions with approximately 8,000 employees and 3,000 customers.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	The financial results of our nine operating regions are reported in the following three distinct segments:
1012620_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our North American Operations segment includes seven regions that serve 41 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces and includes 115 short line and regional freight railroads with more than 13,000 track-miles.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our Australian Operations segment serves New South Wales, the Northern Territory and South Australia and operates the 1,400 -mile Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail line.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	As of December 1, 2016, the Australia Region is 51.1% owned by G W and 48.9% owned by a consortium of funds and clients managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our U.K./European Operations segment is led by Freightliner Group Limited (Freightliner), the United Kingdom's (U.K.) largest rail maritime intermodal operator and second-largest freight rail provider, as well as regional rail services in Continental Europe.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our subsidiaries and joint ventures also provide rail service at more than 40 major ports, rail-ferry service between the United States Southeast and Mexico, transload services, contract coal loading, and industrial railcar switching and repair.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	As more fully described in Note 18 , Segment and Geographic Area Information , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report, the results of operations of the foreign entities are maintained in the respective local currency and then translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result, any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the United States dollar will impact our results of operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	During the third quarter of 2017, our Mountain West Region railroads were consolidated into our Central and Pacific regions, and the Pacific Region was renamed the Western Region.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	The consolidation reduced our number of operating regions from ten to nine.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	Our Australian business underwent a transformational change on December 1, 2016, with the acquisition of GRail and the formation of the Australia Partnership, which we control through our 51.1% interest.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	The GRail acquisition significantly expanded our operations in New South Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	In conjunction with the GRail acquisition that closed on December 1, 2016, we issued a 48.9% equity stake in our Australian subsidiary, G W Australia Holdings LP (GWAHLP) to MIRA.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	We retained a 51.1% controlling interest in GWAHLP and continue to consolidate 100% of our Australian Operations in our financial statements and report a noncontrolling interest for MIRA s 48.9% equity ownership.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S8	As a result, (1) 100% of the assets and liabilities of our Australian Operations, after the elimination of intercompany balances, were included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, with MIRA's 48.9% noncontrolling interest reflected in the equity section, (2) our operating revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included 100% of our Australian Operations, while net income attributable to G W reflected our 51.1% ownership position in our Australian Operations since the formation of the partnership on December 1, 2016 and (3) 100% of the cash flows of our Australian Operations, after the elimination of intercompany items, were included in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S9	Accordingly, any payments between our Australian Operations and our other businesses are eliminated in consolidation, while our cash flows reflect 100% of any cash flows between our Australian Operations and MIRA.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P11_S10	Our Australian Operations did not make any equity distributions to the partners during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Consolidated Annual Results Our operating revenues increased $206.5 million to $2,208.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $2,001.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $398.5 million , compared with $289.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Our operating ratio, defined as operating expenses divided by operating revenues, was 82.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with 85.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	The increase in our operating income in 2017 was primarily due to new operations, including GRail, Providence and Worcester Railroad Company (Providence and Worcester Railroad) and Pentalver.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 also included corporate development and related costs of $11.9 million , primarily related to the acquisitions, $10.2 million of restructuring costs, primarily associated with our U.K./European Operations, and Australia impairment and related charges of $4.9 million , which included $5.9 million related to the write down of track assets on idle branch lines in South Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	These costs were partially offset by a $0.9 million recovery in relation to Arrium Limited's (Arrium) voluntary administration, a net reduction to other expenses of $8.9 million as a result of the buyout of the Freightliner acquisition deferred consideration agreements with certain former Freightliner management holders and a $1.1 million reduction to expense associated with a prior year accrual established for the restructuring of our U.K. coal business.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	When we discuss either operating ratios from existing operations or same railroad operating ratios, we are referring to the change in our operating ratio, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our net income attributable to G W for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $549.1 million , compared with net income of $141.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.79 with 62.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared with diluted EPS of $2.42 with 58.3 million weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Our benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $261.3 million , while our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $74.4 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	The benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included an income tax benefit of approximately $394 million resulting from reducing the value of our net deferred tax liabilities from a 35% United States federal income tax rate to the newly enacted rate of 21% , partially offset by an estimated transitional (toll) tax of approximately $22 million , both associated with the TCJA signed into law in December 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	Our results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included certain items affecting comparability between the periods that are set forth below (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we generated $479.2 million in cash flows from operating activities.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	During the same period, we purchased $228.5 million of property and equipment, including $8.6 million for new business investments, partially offset by $20.2 million in cash received from government grants and other outside parties for capital spending, $5.2 million in cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and $1.6 million in insurance proceeds received for the replacement of assets.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also paid $107.6 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Our unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2017 was $393.1 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	Our North American Operations segment fell short of expectations for 2017 primarily due to lower than expected freight traffic as well as higher diesel fuel costs and increased casualty losses and insurance expense.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S5	As a result, North American Operations operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 , decreased $15.7 million , or 4.9% , to $303.9 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S6	Operating revenues from our North American Operations increased $37.5 million , or 3.0% , to $1,274.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $1,236.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P15_S7	Excluding $29.9 million of revenues from new operations and a $2.0 million increase from the impact of foreign currency appreciation , our North American Operations same railroad revenues increased $5.7 million , or 0.5% .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	When we discuss either operating revenues from existing operations or same railroad operating revenues, we are referring to the change in our operating revenues, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Total traffic from our North American Operations increased 28,929 carloads, or 1.8% , to 1,603,182 carloads for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	The increase consisted of 38,003 carloads from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of 9,074 carloads, or 0.6% , from existing operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	The decrease in traffic from existing operations was principally due to decreases of 8,979 carloads of agricultural products, 5,572 carloads of petroleum products traffic, 3,772 carloads of metallic ores traffic, 2,669 carloads of chemicals and plastics traffic, 2,608 carloads of metals traffic, 2,498 carloads of pulp and paper traffic, and 2,402 carloads of food and kindred products traffic, partially offset by increases of 6,631 carloads of minerals and stone traffic, 5,959 carloads of waste traffic, 3,701 carloads of autos and auto parts traffic, and 3,277 carloads of coal and coke traffic.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	All remaining traffic decreased by a net 142 carloads.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S5	Operating income from our North American Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $303.9 million , compared with $319.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S6	The operating ratio from our North American Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 76.2% , compared with 74.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S7	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $8.2 million of corporate development and related costs and $0.5 million of restructuring costs.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P16_S8	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $7.2 million of corporate development and related costs and $0.9 million of restructuring costs.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our Australian Operations segment exceeded expectations in 2017 primarily due to the recommencement of iron ore and manganese mines as well as good expense management.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	In addition, our Australia business underwent a transformational change on December 1, 2016, with the acquisition of GRail and the formation of the Australia Partnership, which we control through our 51.1% interest.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	The GRail acquisition significantly expanded our operations in New South Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Prior to the GRail acquisition, our Australian subsidiary, Freightliner Australia Pty Ltd (Freightliner Australia), provided rail operator services to GRail, which were recorded as freight-related revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	These freight-related services continued post acquisition, but are now eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S5	Revenues from GRail were included in our consolidated freight revenues from new operations since the December 1, 2016 acquisition date.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S6	Operating revenues from our Australian Operations increased $84.9 million , or 38.2% , to $307.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S7	Excluding $63.0 million of net revenues from new operations and a $6.9 million increase from the impact of foreign currency appreciation, our Australian Operations same railroad operating revenues increased by $15.1 million , or 6.6% , primarily due to an increase in freight revenues resulting from the recommencement of operations at two previously closed iron ore and manganese mines.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P17_S8	When comparing our freight-related and all other revenues from existing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 to our freight-related and all other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 , our 2017 existing operations included $42.8 million of revenues for services provided to GRail for the year ended December 31, 2017 , which were eliminated in consolidated freight-related and all other revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Total traffic from our Australian Operations increased 335,760 carloads to 552,155 carloads for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase consisted of 327,851 carloads from new operations and an increase of 7,909 carloads, or 3.7% , from existing operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	The increase in traffic from existing operations was principally due to increases of 15,651 carloads of metallic ores traffic and 8,547 carloads of agricultural products traffic , partially offset by decreases of 12,188 carloads of minerals and stone traffic and 3,263 carloads of coal and coke traffic.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	All remaining traffic decreased by a net 838 carloads.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	Operating income from our Australian Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $77.3 million , compared with $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S5	The operating ratio from our Australian Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 74.9% , compared with an operating ratio of 97.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S6	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included impairment and related charges of $4.9 million , of which $5.9 million related to the write down of track assets on idle branch lines in South Australia and was partially offset by a $0.9 million recovery in relation to the Arrium voluntary administration.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P18_S7	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $21.1 million of charges related to the impairment of a rolling-stock maintenance facility and associated write-off of accounts receivable in the first quarter of 2016 resulting from Arrium's voluntary administration, $14.7 million of corporate development and related costs primarily associated with the GRail transactions and $0.8 million of restructuring costs.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Operations Following the restructuring of our Continental Europe intermodal business in the first quarter of 2017, our U.K./European Operations segment generally performed consistent with our expectations with multiple commercial and operational initiatives completed in the U.K., more fluid flow of containers from the shipping lines through the U.K. ports and an improving U.K. business climate.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Although our U.K./Europe segment ended the year with higher than expected operating costs in the fourth quarter, we expect further revenue growth and improvements in operating income in 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	In addition, our new acquisition, Pentalver, is performing well and we are investing in additional container storage capacity in the Port of London Gateway.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	Operating revenues from our U.K./European Operations increased $84.1 million , or 15.5% , to $626.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $542.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	Excluding $102.6 million of revenues from our new operations relating to Pentalver and a $13.4 million decrease from the impact of foreign currency depreciation, our U.K./European Operations same railroad revenues decreased $5.1 million , or 1.0% , primarily due to a decrease in Continental Europe intermodal revenues following the discontinuation of certain intermodal train services as part of the restructuring of ERS Railways B.V. (ERS).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S5	Total traffic from our U.K./European Operations decreased 11,467 carloads, or 1.0% , to 1,092,549 carloads for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S6	The decrease in traffic was principally due to decreases of 17,714 carloads of coal and coke traffic and 13,939 carloads of intermodal traffic , partially offset by increases of 19,053 carloads of minerals and stone traffic and 1,807 carloads of agricultural products traffic.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S7	All remaining traffic decreased by a net 674 carloads.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S8	Operating income from our U.K./European Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.3 million , compared with an operating loss of $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S9	The operating ratio from our U.K./European Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 97.2% , compared with 106.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S10	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $9.4 million of restructuring costs, $4.0 million of corporate development and related costs, an $8.9 million reduction to other expenses as a result of the buyout of the Freightliner acquisition deferred consideration agreements and a $1.1 million reduction to expense associated with a prior year accrual established for the restructuring of our U.K. coal business.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P19_S11	The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 included impairment and related charges of $21.5 million related to ERS, $14.7 million of restructuring and related charges associated with our U.K. coal business and $6.5 million of corporate development and related costs.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we retained a 51.1% ownership in GWAHLP.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	As we maintain control of our Australian Operations, we continue to consolidate 100% of our Australian Operations in our financial statements and report a noncontrolling interest for MIRA s 48.9% equity ownership.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	We and MIRA contributed a combined A$1.3 billion in the form of cash, partner loans and contributed equity, and our subsidiary, GWI Acquisitions Pty Ltd (GWIA), entered into a five -year A$690.0 million senior secured term loan facility that is non-recourse to us and to MIRA.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Arrium Limited: Between 2011 and 2014, GWA invested a total of $78 million to purchase locomotives and railcars, as well as to construct a standard gauge rolling-stock maintenance facility to support iron ore shipments from Arrium's Southern Iron mine and Whyalla-based operations, which include the Middleback Range iron ore mines and the Whyalla steelworks.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	On April 7, 2016, Arrium announced it had entered into voluntary administration.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	As a result, during the first quarter of 2016, we recorded a $13.0 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of an idle rolling-stock maintenance facility, which was recorded to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses, which represented the entire carrying value of these assets, and an allowance for doubtful accounts charge of $8.1 million associated with accounts receivable from Arrium, which was recorded to other expenses within operating expense.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	Also as a result of the voluntary administration, all payments to GWA associated with the Southern Iron rail haulage agreement have ceased.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	In December 2017, we recovered $0.9 million of cash in relation to Arrium's voluntary administration.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	On August 31, 2017, Arrium was sold to GFG Alliance.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	The steel making business was rebranded as Liberty OneSteel and the mining business was rebranded as SIMEC Mining.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	GWA continues to provide services and receive payments under the rail haulage agreement for the Middleback Range operations, which includes service to several iron ore mines in the Middleback Range and the Whyalla steelworks operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	for 97.8 million (or $126.2 million at the exchange rate on May 3, 2017 ) or 77.5 million (or $100.1 million at the exchange rate on May 3, 2017 ) net of cash received of 20.2 million (or $26.1 million at the exchange rate on May 3, 2017 ).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	We funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the total consideration to United States dollars was $1.29 for one British pound (GBP).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Headquartered in Southampton, U.K., Pentalver operates off-dock container terminals (most under long-term lease) strategically placed at each of the four major seaports of Felixstowe, Southampton, London Gateway and Tilbury, as well as an inland terminal located at Cannock, in the U.K. Midlands, near many of the nation s largest distribution centers.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	In addition to providing storage for loaded and empty containers on over 100 acres of land, Pentalver also operates a trucking haulage service with more than 150 trucks, primarily providing daily service between the seaports of Felixstowe and Southampton and its inland terminal at Cannock.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Pentalver also provides services related to container maintenance and repair (including refrigerated containers) and is one of the largest sellers of new and used containers in the U.K.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	The results of operations from Pentalver have been included in our consolidated statement of operations within our U.K./European Operations segment since the May 3, 2017, acquisition date.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Continental Europe Intermodal Business: During 2016, we explored ways to enhance the long-term viability of ERS, the Continental Europe intermodal business Freightliner acquired from Maersk, which we acquired in 2015 with the Freightliner acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Due to its limited history of profitability and competitive dynamics in the market in which it operates, we ascribed little value to it at the time of acquisition.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Despite a significant and focused effort by us, the performance of ERS reached unsustainable levels during 2016 and a restructuring plan was initiated.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	In conjunction with that plan, in 2017, we ceased all "open" train services from the port of Rotterdam, closed the ERS offices in Rotterdam and Frankfurt and the ERS customer services function in Warsaw.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	We are in the process of redistributing ERS s leased locomotives and railcars, which have lease termination dates up through 2019.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S5	These steps will enable us to focus on the deep sea intermodal sector.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S6	Our subsidiary, Rotterdam Rail Feeding B.V., will continue its existing services and not be affected by the restructuring of ERS.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S7	As a result of the ERS restructuring plan, we recorded impairment and related charges of $21.5 million in December 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S8	These charges primarily included $14.5 million for an impairment of goodwill and $4.1 million for an impairment of a customer-related intangible asset, which were both recorded to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses, which represented the entire carrying value of these assets.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P28_S9	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , we recorded $5.7 million of restructuring costs related to ERS, primarily for severance costs and costs associated with surplus locomotive and railcar leases.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Restructuring of U.K. Coal Business: During 2016, due to a drastic decline in coal shipments, we implemented a restructuring of our U.K. coal business.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The U.K. coal business, which we acquired as part of the Freightliner acquisition in 2015, is a relatively low-margin business, and we originally expected to cease coal shipments by 2022.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	We incurred charges related to the U.K. coal restructuring program of $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	These charges included $10.5 million associated with leased railcars that exceed our expected ongoing needs and were permanently taken out of service, which was recorded to equipment rents within operating expenses, as well as $4.2 million of severance and related costs associated with restructuring our workforce.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a reduction to equipment rents within operating expenses of $1.1 million associated with an adjustment to the liability recorded in 2016 for the leased railcars.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Acquisition of Freightliner Group Limited: On March 25, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of RailInvest Holding Company Limited, the parent company of London-based Freightliner, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase Agreement dated February 24, 2015.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Management Shareholders retained an approximate 6% economic interest in Freightliner in the form of deferred consideration.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	We bought out this deferred consideration in November 2017, as described below.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Headquartered in London, England, Freightliner is an international freight rail operator with operations in the U.K., Poland, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	Freightliner's principal business is located in the U.K., where it is the largest maritime intermodal operator and the second largest freight rail operator, providing service throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	In Continental Europe, Freightliner Poland primarily serves aggregates and coal customers in Poland.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	In addition, at the time of acquisition, Freightliner's ERS subsidiary, based in Rotterdam, provided cross-border intermodal services connecting the northern European ports of Rotterdam, Bremerhaven and Hamburg to key cities in Germany, Poland, Italy and beyond.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	In Australia, Freightliner transports coal and containerized agricultural products for its customers in New South Wales.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	As of the acquisition date, Freightliner employed approximately 2,500 people worldwide and had a fleet of primarily leased equipment of approximately 250 standard gauge locomotives, including approximately 45 electric locomotives, and 5,500 railcars.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	We funded the acquisition with borrowings under the Credit Agreement (see Note 8 , Long-Term Debt , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report) and available cash.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	The foreign exchange rate used to translate the total consideration to United States dollars was $1.49 for one British pound, the exchange rate on March 25, 2015.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	The calculation of the total consideration for the Freightliner acquisition is presented below (amounts in thousands):
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	As of March 25, 2015, we recorded a contingent liability within other long-term liabilities of 24.2 million (or $36.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	This contingent liability represented the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to us by the Management Shareholders representing an economic interest of approximately 6% on the acquisition date at the Freightliner acquisition price per share, in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest in the future (deferred consideration).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	We bought out this deferred consideration in November 2017 with the issuance of 238,201 shares of our Class A Common Stock with a grant date fair value of $17.5 million , as well as 2.1 million (or $2.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) in cash to be paid in March 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	These shares have time-based contractual restrictions on their transfer until March 2018, March 2019 and March 2020.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	In addition, we issued a note payable with a 6.3 million (or $8.6 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) face value ( 5.7 million fair value, or $7.7 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) to certain management holders as part of the buyout of the deferred consideration.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S5	This note is payable in three annual installments starting in March 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S6	We recorded a net gain of $8.9 million on the buyout of the deferred consideration in November 2017, which is included within other expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S7	The results of operations from Freightliner have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the March 25, 2015 acquisition date.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P34_S8	U.K. and Continental Europe operations are included in our U.K./European Operations segment and the results of Freightliner's Australia operations are included in our Australian Operations segment.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	(a) Represents revenues for services provided by Freightliner Australia to GRail for the 11 months ended November 2017 (the new operations period), which were eliminated in our consolidated revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Operating revenues were $2,208.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $2,001.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , an increase of $206.5 million , or 10.3% .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The $206.5 million increase in operating revenues consisted of $195.4 million in net revenues from new operations and an $11.1 million increase in existing operations, primarily due to an increase in freight revenues, partially offset by a decrease in freight-related and all other revenues.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $97.7 million , or 5.7% , to $1,809.6 million , compared with $1,711.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	The increase consisted of $158.5 million from new operations, partially offset by a decrease of $60.8 million from existing operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	When we discuss either operating expenses from existing operations or same railroad operating expenses, we are referring to the change in our operating expenses, period-over-period, associated with operations that we managed in both periods (i.e., excluding the impact of acquisitions).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Excluding a $1.4 million decrease from the depreciation of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar, operating expenses from existing operations decreased $59.4 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table sets forth our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):

1012620_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Operating Income/Operating Ratio Operating income was $398.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $289.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 included corporate development and related costs of $11.9 million , restructuring costs of $10.2 million and impairment and related charges of $4.9 million related to our Australian Operations, partially offset by an $8.9 million reduction to expense as a result of the buyout of the Freightliner deferred consideration.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The United States Short Line Tax Credit was an income tax track maintenance credit for Class II and Class III railroads to reduce their federal income tax based on qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures (the Short Line Tax Credit).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Qualified expenditures included amounts incurred for maintaining track, including roadbed, bridges and related track structures owned or leased by a Class II or Class III railroad.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	In accordance with our Australia Partnership agreement, the cash and cash equivalents of our Australian Operations can be used to make payments in the usual and regular course of business, pay down debt of the Partnership and make distributions to the Partners in proportion to their investments.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	Based on current expectations, we believe our cash, together with our other liquid assets, anticipated future cash flows from operations, availability under our credit agreement, access to debt and equity capital markets and sources of available financing will be sufficient to fund expected operating, capital and debt service requirements and other financial commitments for the foreseeable future.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , we completed the acquisitions of Pentalver for cash consideration of 77.5 million (or $100.1 million at the exchange rate on May 3, 2017 ) net of cash received of 20.2 million (or $26.1 million at the exchange rate on May 3, 2017 ) and HOG for cash consideration of $5.6 million .

1012620_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return that includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	In accordance with the TCJA that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, we recorded a provisional liability of approximately $22 million of United States income tax associated with unrepatriated foreign earnings, which will be payable over eight years.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P147_S3	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions may result in foreign exchange gains and losses and be subject to other taxes and credits, including U.S. state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries; however, the amount of the tax and credits is not practicable to determine.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P147_S4	No provision is made for the impact of those future foreign exchange gains or losses or such other potential taxes and credits that could be applicable to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in the event of distribution.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	Shelf Registration We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires September 14, 2018), around which time we expect to file a replacement shelf registration statement.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and units.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P148_S2	Under this shelf registration, we completed a public offering of 4,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at $75.00 per share on December 13, 2016 .

1012620_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	Partner Loan Agreement On December 1, 2016, GWAHLP and MIRA entered into a Partner Loan Agreement with an A$238.0 million non-recourse subordinated partner loan from MIRA used to fund a portion of its contribution to the Australia Partnership to fund the acquisition of GRail (note our subsidiary, GWI Holding B.V., has a matching partner loan for a portion of our contribution that is eliminated in consolidation).
1012620_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	The Partner Loan Agreement is subordinated to the Australian Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	The maturity date of the partner loan is November 1, 2026.

1012620_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	In 2010, as part of the acquisition of FreightLink Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific Transport Pty Ltd and related corporate entities, we assumed debt with a carrying value of A$1.8 million (or $1.7 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010), which represented the fair value of an A$50.0 million (or $48.2 million at the exchange rate on December 1, 2010) non-interest bearing loan due in 2054 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the carrying value of the loan was A$3.1 million (or $2.4 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) with a non-cash imputed interest rate of 8.0% .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	Equipment and Property Leases We enter into operating leases for railcars, locomotives and other equipment as well as real property.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	We also enter into agreements with other railroads and other third parties to operate over certain sections of their track, whereby we pay a per car fee to use the track or make an annual lease payment.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P153_S2	The costs associated with operating leases are expensed as incurred.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P153_S3	For additional information regarding our equipment and property leases, see Note 6 , Property and Equipment and Leases , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P153_S4	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Our railroads have received a number of project grants from federal, provincial, state and local agencies and other outside parties for upgrades and construction of rail lines and upgrades of locomotives.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	We use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P154_S2	In return for the grants, the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines or equipment that had been upgraded or constructed.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P154_S3	We believe the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P154_S4	However, we can offer no assurance that grants from outside parties will continue to be available or that, even if available, our railroads will be able to obtain them.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Insurance and Third-Party Claims Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims was $10.8 million and $12.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	Accounts receivable from insurance and other third-party claims at December 31, 2017 included $5.9 million from our North American Operations, $4.3 million from our U.K./European Operations and $0.6 million from our Australian Operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P155_S2	The balance from our North American Operations resulted predominately from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a 2015 trestle fire in the United States and derailments in Canada.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P155_S3	The balance from our U.K./European Operations resulted primarily from our anticipated insurance recoveries associated with a pre-acquisition rail-related collision in Germany in 2014 that occurred prior to our acquisition of Freightliner.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P155_S4	We received proceeds from insurance totaling $1.6 million , $15.2 million and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	2018 Estimated Capital Expenditures The following table sets forth our budgeted capital expenditures by segment for the year ending December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	We have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations, while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and new investments.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of our Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 , there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	The following table represents our obligations and commitments for future cash payments under various agreements as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	(c) Includes the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $14.4 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	(d) Includes purchase commitments for future capital expenditures among our existing operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	(e) Includes future payment obligations associated with the acquisitions of Freightliner and HOG of $16.5 million , deferred compensation of $13.5 million , estimated casualty obligations of $3.8 million and certain other long-term liabilities of $10.5 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S3	In addition, the table includes our 2018 estimated contributions of $11.6 million to our pension plans and estimated post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits of $6.7 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S4	As a result of the TCJA, we recorded a one-time estimated transition (toll) tax of approximately $22 million on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which were previously deferred for United States federal income tax purposes and can be paid over an eight-year period beginning in 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S5	This toll tax was not included in the table above as it does not represent a contractual obligation.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S6	For additional information regarding the transition tax, see Note 13 , Income Taxes , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P160_S7	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	An off-balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation, agreement or transaction involving an unconsolidated entity under which we (1) have made guarantees, (2) have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets, or a similar arrangement, that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets, (3) have an obligation under certain derivative instruments, or (4) have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing or hedging services with us.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	Our off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017 consisted of operating lease obligations, which are included in the contractual obligations table above.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	Effective January 1, 2019, we will adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which will require lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	See Note 20 , Recently Issued Accounting Standards , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P162_S2	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report for additional information regarding this standard.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	The results of operations of our foreign entities are maintained in the local currency (including, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Euro and the Polish zloty) and then translated into United States dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the period for balance sheet items and, for the statement of operations, at the average exchange rate for the statement period.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	When comparing the effects of average foreign currency exchange rates on operating revenues and operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 versus the year ended December 31, 2016 , foreign currency translation had a net positive impact on our consolidated operating revenues and a net negative impact on our consolidated operating expenses due to the weakening of the British pound relative to the United States dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Australian and Canadian dollars and the Euro relative to the United States dollar for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	The following tables reflect the exchange rates used to translate the foreign entities respective local currency into United States dollars as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :
1012620_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect business combinations, reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets, as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	The following critical accounting policies and use of estimates should be read in conjunction with Note 2 , Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	We account for businesses we acquire using the acquisition method of accounting.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	Under this method, all acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	We record the underlying net assets at their respective acquisition-date fair values.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	As part of this process, we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P168_S2	These determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions, including those with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives, and therefore require considerable judgment.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P168_S3	These determinations affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in future periods.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P168_S4	The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning on the respective business's acquisition date.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	Property and Equipment We record property and equipment at cost.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	We capitalize major renewals or improvements, but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P169_S2	We incur maintenance and repair expenses to keep our operations safe and fit for existing purpose.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P169_S3	Major renewals or improvements to property and equipment, however, are undertaken to extend the useful life or increase the functionality of the asset, or both.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	When assessing spending for classification among capital or expense, we evaluate the substance of the respective spending.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	For example, costs incurred to modify a railroad bridge, either through individual projects or pre-established multi-year programs, which substantially upgrade the bridge's capacity to carry increased loads and/or to allow for a carrying speed beyond the original or existing capacity of the bridge, are capitalized.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P170_S2	However, costs for replacement of routinely wearable bridge components, such as plates or bolts, are expensed as incurred.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P170_S3	Other than a de minimis threshold under which costs are expensed as incurred, we do not apply pre-defined capitalization thresholds when assessing spending for classification among capital or expense.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	Unlike the Class I railroads that operate over extensive contiguous rail networks, our short line and regional railroads are generally geographically dispersed businesses that transport freight over relatively short distances.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	Our largest category of capital expenditures is for track line upgrades, expansion and replacement, where we will utilize both our employees and professional contractors in completing these capital projects.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	Costs that are directly attributable to self-constructed assets (including overhead costs) are capitalized.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	Direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include materials, labor and equipment.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P172_S2	Indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P172_S3	We also generally do not incur significant rail grinding or ballast cleaning expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P172_S4	However, if and when such costs are incurred, they are expensed.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P172_S5	The following table sets forth our total net capitalized major renewals and improvements versus our total maintenance and repair expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	We depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the property and equipment.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	The following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment:
1012620_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived tangible assets may not be recoverable.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	When factors indicate that an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset or asset group in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P174_S2	If we identify impairment of an asset, we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value less the cost to sell such asset, as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Losses from impairment of assets are charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	Gains or losses on sales, including sales of assets removed during track and equipment upgrade projects, or losses incurred through other dispositions, such as unanticipated retirement or destruction, are credited or charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	Gains are recorded when realized if the sale value exceeds the remaining carrying value of the respective property and equipment.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	If the estimated salvage value is less than the remaining carrying value, we record the loss incurred equal to the respective asset's carrying value less salvage value.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $5.9 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of track assets on idle branch lines in South Australia.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $13.0 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of an idle rolling-stock maintenance facility resulting from Arrium, an iron ore customer in Australia, entering voluntary administration.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P177_S2	For additional information regarding Arrium, see Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P177_S3	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P177_S4	There were no material losses incurred through other dispositions from unanticipated or unusual events for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	Grants from Outside Parties Grants from outside parties are recorded within deferred items - grants from outside parties, and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the associated assets are depreciated.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	Goodwill We review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment since these assets are not amortized.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S1	We perform our annual impairment assessment as of November 30 of each year.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S2	Additionally, we review the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S3	No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 , as a result of our annual impairment assessment.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S4	In 2016, in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill combined with previously discussed efforts to address challenges with our Continental Europe intermodal business, ERS, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $14.5 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S5	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P179_S6	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ERS.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	For goodwill, a two-step impairment model is used.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	The first step compares the fair value of a respective reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P180_S2	The second step measures the goodwill impairment loss as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	The determination of fair value involves significant management judgment including assumptions about operating results, business plans, income projections, anticipated future cash flows and market data.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	Impairment losses are expensed when incurred and are charged to net loss/(gain) on sale and impairment of assets within operating expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	Amortizable Intangible Assets We perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators are present.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P183_S1	We have amortizable intangible assets valued primarily as operational network rights, customer contracts and relationships and track access agreements.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P183_S2	These intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic longevity of the facility served, the customer relationship, or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P183_S3	In 2016, in conjunction with our annual impairment assessment of goodwill combined with previously disclosed efforts to address challenges with ERS, we recorded an impairment of a customer-related intangible asset of $4.1 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P183_S4	See Note 3 , Changes in Operations , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P183_S5	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report for additional information regarding ERS.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	Derailment and Property Damages, Personal Injuries and Third-Party Claims We maintain global liability and property insurance coverage to mitigate the financial risk of providing rail and rail-related services.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	Our liability policies cover railroad employee injuries, personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents and accidents involving passengers and other third-party claims associated with our operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P184_S2	Damages associated with sudden releases of hazardous materials, including hazardous commodities transported by rail, and expenses related to evacuation as a result of a railroad accident are also covered under our liability policies.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P184_S3	Our liability policies currently have self-insured retentions of up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our property policies cover property and equipment that we own, as well as property in our care, custody and control.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P185_S1	Our property policies currently have various self-insured retentions, which vary based on the type and location of the incident, that are currently up to $2.5 million per occurrence.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P185_S2	The property policies also provide business interruption insurance arising from covered events.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P185_S3	The self-insured retentions under our policies may change with each annual insurance renewal depending on our loss history, the size and make-up of our Company and general insurance market conditions.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P185_S4	We also maintain ancillary insurance coverage for other risks associated with rail and rail-related services, including insurance for employment practices, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, pollution, auto claims, crime and road haulage liability, among others.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	Accruals for claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	These estimates are updated in future periods as information develops.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	Defined Benefit Plans We sponsor certain defined benefit plans covering eligible employees.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	We engage independent actuaries to compute amounts of liabilities and expenses related to these plans subject to the assumptions that we determine are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P187_S2	These assumptions include, but are not limited to the selection of a discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, inflation volatility and mortality.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P187_S3	For additional information regarding these plans, see Note 11 , U.K. Pension Plan , and Note 12 , Other Employee Benefit Programs , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P187_S4	Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" of this Annual Report.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	Income Taxes We file a consolidated United States federal income tax return, which includes all of our United States subsidiaries.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P188_S1	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files appropriate income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences using a balance sheet approach.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	Such temporary differences result primarily from differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Future realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P190_S1	We evaluate on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, the deferred income tax assets will be realizable.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	Valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P191_S1	On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P191_S2	The TCJA reduced the United States federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P191_S3	Additionally, the TCJA requires United States companies to compute a one-time transition (toll) tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred for United States federal income tax purposes.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P191_S4	We have estimated the impact of the reduction in the United States federal corporate tax rate to be a reduction to our net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $394 million , which represents a decrease in corporate income taxes expected to be paid in the future.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P191_S5	We have also estimated the toll tax to be approximately $22 million payable over an eight-year period beginning in 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	Each of our foreign subsidiaries files income tax returns in each of its respective countries.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P192_S1	No provision is made for certain taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P192_S2	The amount of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 was $237.9 million .
1012620_18_ITEM7_P192_S3	If the earnings were to be distributed in the future, those distributions would not be subject to United States federal corporate income tax but may result in foreign exchange gains and losses and be subject to other taxes and credits, including United States state taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries; however, the amount of the tax is not practicable to determine.
1012620_18_ITEM7_P192_S4	For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 13 , Income Taxes , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.

1012620_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following tables set forth the primary drivers of our interest expense, net, for our North American Operations, Australia Operations and U.K./European Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	(a) Intercompany borrowing and lending activity is eliminated in consolidation.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	(b) Interest expense on other instruments reflects interest on capital leases and certain fees related to our credit facilities.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our interest rate risk results from variable interest rate debt obligations, where an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The following table presents principal payments on our debt obligations, related weighted average annual interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The variable interest rates presented in the table above are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve for borrowings denominated using Australia BBSY and BBR, Canada BA, Euro LIBOR and United States LIBOR (as of December 31, 2017 ).
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	BBSY is the Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate, which we believe is generally considered the Australian equivalent to LIBOR.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	BBR is the Bankers Buyers Rate, which we believe is generally considered analogous with BBSY.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 1.50% for Canadian, European and United States borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of 2.78% for our Australian term loan under our Australian Credit Agreement and 4.50% for our Partner Loan Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	To the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap agreements, based on the table above, assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates, annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately $12.7 million under our Credit Agreement and $3.1 million under our Australian Credit Agreement and Partner Loan Agreement.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , our foreign subsidiaries had the United States dollar equivalent of $1.1 billion of third-party debt denominated in the local currencies in which our foreign subsidiaries operate, including the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Euro.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The debt service obligations associated with this foreign currency debt are generally funded directly from those foreign operations.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As a result, foreign currency risk related to this portion of our debt service payments is limited.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	However, in the event the foreign currency debt service is not paid by our foreign subsidiaries and is paid by United States subsidiaries, we may face exchange rate risk if the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar or the Euro were to appreciate relative to the United States dollar and require higher United States dollar equivalent cash.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including non-functional currency intercompany debt, typically associated with intercompany debt from our United States subsidiaries to our foreign subsidiaries, associated with acquisitions and any timing difference between announcement and closing of an acquisition of a foreign business.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To mitigate currency exposures of non-United States dollar-denominated acquisitions, we may enter into foreign currency forward purchase contracts.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	To mitigate currency exposures related to non-functional currency denominated intercompany debt, we may enter into cross-currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts for periods consistent with the underlying debt.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In determining the fair value of the derivative contract, the significant inputs to valuation models are quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	However, cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate exposures on foreign currency intercompany debt may not qualify for hedge accounting.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	In cases where the cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure, thus reducing the associated risk.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings within other income, net.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S4	For additional information regarding our Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 9 , Derivative Financial Instruments , to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in "Part IV Item 15.

1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S6	Deferred Consideration On March 25, 2015, as part of the Freightliner acquisition, we recorded a contingent liability within other long-term liabilities of 24.2 million (or $36.0 million at the exchange rate on March 25, 2015).
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S7	This contingent liability represented the aggregate fair value of the shares transferred to us by the Management Shareholders representing an economic interest of approximately 6% on the acquisition date at the Freightliner acquisition price per share, in exchange for the right to receive cash consideration for the representative economic interest in the future (deferred consideration).
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S8	We bought out this deferred consideration in November 2017 with the issuance of 238,201 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock with a grant date fair value of $17.5 million , as well as 2.1 million (or $2.9 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) in cash to be paid in March 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S9	These shares have time-based contractual restrictions on their transfer until March 2018, March 2019 and March 2020.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S10	In addition, we issued a note payable with a 6.3 million (or $8.6 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) face value ( 5.7 million fair value, or $7.7 million at the exchange rate on December 31, 2017 ) to certain management holders to buy out a portion of the deferred consideration.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S11	This note is payable in three annual installments starting in March 2018.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P7_S12	We recorded a net $8.9 million gain on the buyout of the deferred consideration in November 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Sensitivity to Diesel Fuel Prices We are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented 8.1% of our total operating expenses.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P8_S3	We receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments that offset the majority of the impact of higher fuel prices, with a lag of up to four months.
1012620_18_ITEM7A_P8_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , each one percentage point change in the price of diesel fuel would result in a $1.6 million change in our annual operating income to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges and/or rates.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	On May 3, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pentalver.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We extended our oversight and monitoring processes that support our internal control over financial reporting, as appropriate, to include Pentalver's financial position, results of operations and cash flow into our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	We are continuing to integrate the acquired operations of Pentalver into our overall internal control over financial reporting and related processes.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Except as disclosed in this paragraph, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Genesee Wyoming Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company's internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Company's Audit Committee.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Consistent with the guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting related to Pentalver.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company acquired Pentalver in a business combination on May 3, 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Pentalver's total assets represented 2% of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2017 .
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Pentalver's total revenues and operating income for the period May 3, 2017 through December 31, 2017 represented less than 5% and 1% of Genesee Wyoming Inc.'s revenues and operating income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2017 , we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
1012620_18_ITEM9A_P5_S4	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report, which is included herein under "Part IV.
1012620_18_ITEM10_P0_S0	We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct that applies to all directors, officers and employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our Chief Accounting Officer and Global Controller.
