1385280_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry in terms of both attendance and the number of screens in operation.

1385280_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our circuit is the third largest in the U.S. with 293 theatres and 3,832 screens in 39 states.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	We are the most geographically diverse circuit in Latin America with 137 theatres and 1,113 screens in 13 countries.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P3_S4	Our modern theatre circuit features stadium seating in approximately 86% of our first-run auditoriums.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	We believe our portfolio of modern theatres provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our significant cash flows from operating activities.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our significant presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly as they look to capitalize on the expanding worldwide box office.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our market leadership is attributable in large part to our senior executives, whose years of industry experience range from 14 to 52 years and who have successfully navigated us through multiple industry and economic cycles.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Revenues, operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $2,141.1 million, $292.8 million and $146.1 million, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	At December 31, 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of $465.0 million and long-term debt of $1,532.5 million.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	Approximately $422.8 million, or 27.6%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and approximately $10.8 million of our long-term debt matures in 2011.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	During 2009, we began converting our circuit from film based to digital projection technology.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Digital projection technology gives us greater flexibility in programming and facilitates the exhibition of live and pre-recorded alternative entertainment.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	We also developed a premium experience auditorium concept utilizing large screens and the latest in digital projection and sound technologies, which we call our Cinemark XD Extreme Digital Cinema, or XD.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	The XD experience includes wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens, wrap-around sound and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an intense sensory experience.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	We charge a premium price for the XD experience.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S5	The XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in the XD auditorium.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P6_S6	We currently have 47 XD auditoriums in our theatres and have plans to install 35 to 40 more XD auditoriums during 2011.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	During late 2010, we introduced our NextGen concept, which features wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens and the latest digital projection and sound technologies in all of the auditoriums of a complex.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	auditorium with enhanced sound and seating.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Most of our future domestic theatres will incorporate this NextGen concept.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	We also plan to convert our six existing IMAX screens to digital technology and purchase two additional digital IMAX systems to convert two of our existing screens during 2011, in conjunction with our recent settlement with IMAX.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its transition to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail and in a range of up to 35 trillion colors.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	Because digital features aren t susceptible to scratching and fading, digital presentations will always remain clear and sharp every time they are shown.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie and due to its format, it enables us to more efficiently move films between auditoriums within a theatre as demand increases or decreases for each film.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Digital projection also allows the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded concert events, the opera, sports programs and special live documentaries.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Twenty-two films released wide during 2010 were available in 3-D format and at least 34 3-D films are expected to be released during 2011.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images that immerse the patron into a film.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	A premium is generally charged for a 3-D presentation.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry has a track record of long-term growth, with box office revenues growing at an estimated CAGR of 3.6% from 2000 to 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Against this background of steady long-term growth, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance, and consequently box office revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The following table represents the results of a survey by Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, published during February 2011, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2001 to 2010:
1385280_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2010 included the carryover of Avatar, which grossed approximately $475 million in U.S. box office revenues during 2010 and new releases such as Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Iron Man 2, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Inception, Despicable Me, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek Forever After, Clash of the Titans, The Karate Kid, Tangled, Grown Ups, Megamind, Tron: Legacy, Little Fockers, The Fighter and True Grit.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The film slate for 2011 currently includes Rango, Fast Five, Thor, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Kung Fu Panda 2: The Kaboom of Doom, Cars 2, X Men: First Class, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 2, Twilight: Breaking Dawn, Captain America: The First Avenger, Cowboys and Aliens, Puss in Boots, Happy Feet 2, Sherlock Holmes 2 and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, among other films.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	International box office revenue continues to grow.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $21.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is a result of increasing acceptance of movie going as a popular form of entertainment throughout the world, ticket price increases and new theatre construction.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a 25% increase from 2009.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Growth in Latin America is expected to continue to be fueled by a combination of robust economies, growing populations, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), substantial retail development, and quality product from Hollywood, including an increasing number of 3-D films.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	In many Latin American countries, particularly Mexico and Brazil, successful local film product can also provide incremental growth opportunities.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe many international markets for theatrical exhibition have historically been underserved and that certain of these markets, especially those in Latin America, will continue to experience growth as additional modern stadium-styled theatres are introduced and film product offerings continue to expand.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	We believe the following market trends will drive the continued growth and strength of our industry:
1385280_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands and Subsequent Markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Theatrical exhibition is the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	A successful theatrical release which brands a film is one of the major factors in determining its success in downstream markets, such as DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $21.2 billion, or approximately 67% of 2010 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will become even more significant.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	Many of the top U.S. films released recently also performed exceptionally well in international markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	Such films included Avatar , which grossed approximately $1.5 billion in international markets and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 , which grossed approximately $610 million in international markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the industry.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Even during the recent recessionary period, attendance levels remained stable as consumers selected the theatre as a preferred value for their discretionary income.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	Although domestic attendance declined slightly in 2010, patronage trends during 2010 reflected increasing demand for products unique to the exhibition industry such as 3-D. With the motion picture exhibition industry s transition to digital projection technology, the products offered by motion picture exhibitors continue to expand, attracting a broader base of patrons.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $7.89 in 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Average prices in 2010 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, range from approximately $25.00 to $77.00 per ticket according to MPAA.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009, which has allowed exhibitors to expand their product offerings.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Digital technology allows the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, the opera, concert events and special live documentaries.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	These additional programming alternatives may expand the industry s customer base and increase patronage for exhibitors.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively:
1385280_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We generated operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. of $292.8 million and $146.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined operating philosophy that centers on building high quality assets, while negotiating favorable theatre level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	We have a leading market share in the U.S. metropolitan and suburban markets we serve.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, we ranked either first or second based on box office revenues in 25 out of our top 30 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston and Salt Lake City.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	Strategically Located in Heavily Populated Latin American Markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	Since 1993, we have invested throughout Latin America in response to the continued growth of the region.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	We currently operate 137 theatres and 1,113 screens in 13 countries.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our international screens generated revenues of $564.2 million, or 26.4% of our total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in the region, with theatres in twelve of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	With a geographically diverse circuit, we are an important distribution channel to the movie studios.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S5	Approximately 84% of our international screens offer stadium seating.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P32_S6	We are well-positioned with our modern, large-format theatres to take advantage of these factors for further growth and diversification of our revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	We offer state-of-the-art theatres, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	We feature stadium seating in approximately 86% of our first run auditoriums.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	During 2010, we increased the size of our circuit by adding 138 state-of-the-art screens worldwide.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	We currently have commitments to build 196 additional new screens over the next three years.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	We plan to install digital projection technology in 100% of our U.S. and international auditoriums of which 40-50% will be 3-D compatible.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S5	We also plan to convert our six existing IMAX screens to digital technology and purchase two additional digital IMAX systems to convert two of our existing screens during 2011.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S6	We currently have 47 XD auditoriums in our theatres and have plans to install 35 to 40 more XD auditoriums during 2011.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P33_S7	Our new NextGen theatre concept provides further credence to our commitment to provide a continuing state-of-the-art movie-viewing experience to our patrons.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Solid Balance Sheet with Significant Cash Flow from Operating Activities.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We generate significant cash flow from operating activities as a result of several factors, including a geographically diverse and modern theatre circuit and management s ability to control costs and effectively react to economic and market changes.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	Additionally, owning land and buildings for 42 of our theatres is a strategic advantage that enhances our cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	We believe our expected level of cash flow generation will provide us with the financial flexibility to continue to pursue growth opportunities, support our debt payments and continue to make dividend payments to our stockholders.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we owned approximately 16.9 million shares of National CineMedia and had approximately 1.1 million options to purchase shares in Real D, both of which offer us an additional source of cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P34_S5	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $465.0 million.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Alan Stock, President; Chief Operating Officer Timothy Warner, Chief Financial Officer Robert Copple and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our management team has many years of theatre operating experience, ranging from 14 to 52 years, executing a focused strategy that has led to consistent operating results.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	This management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	We believe our disciplined operating philosophy and experienced management team will enable us to continue to enhance our leading position in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	Key components of our strategy include:
1385280_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Establish and Maintain Leading Market Positions.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	We will continue to seek growth opportunities by building or acquiring modern theatres that meet our strategic, financial and demographic criteria.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	We focus on establishing and maintaining a leading position in the markets we currently serve.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	We also monitor economic and market trends to ensure we offer a broad range of products and prices that satisfy our patrons.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	Continue to Focus on Operational Excellence.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We will continue to focus on achieving operational excellence by controlling theatre operating costs and adequately training our staff while continuing to provide leading customer service.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	Our margins reflect our track record of operating efficiency.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Selectively Build in Profitable, Strategic Latin American Markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Our continued international expansion will remain focused primarily on Latin America through construction of modern, state-of-the-art theatres in growing urban markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	We have commitments to build eight new theatres with 51 screens during 2011 and five new theatres with 34 screens subsequent to 2011, investing an additional $63 million in our Latin American markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	We also plan to install digital projection technology in all of our international auditoriums, which allows us to present 3-D and alternative content in these markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P39_S4	We have also installed eight of our proprietary XD auditoriums in our international theatres and have plans to install approximately 20 to 25 additional XD auditoriums internationally during 2011.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our commitment to technological innovation has resulted in us having 1,363 digital auditoriums in the U.S. as of December 31, 2010, 1,136 of which are 3-D compatible.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	We also had 201 digital auditoriums in our international markets as of December 31, 2010, all of which are 3-D compatible.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	See further discussion of our digital expansion at Conversion to Digital Projection Technology .
1385280_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	We are planning to convert 100% of our worldwide circuit to digital projection technology, approximately 40-50% of which will be 3-D compatible.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P40_S4	We also plan to expand our XD auditorium footprint in various markets throughout the U.S. and in select international markets, which offers our patrons a premium movie-viewing experience.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we operated 430 theatres and 4,945 screens in 39 states and 13 Latin American countries.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our theatres in the U.S. are primarily located in mid-sized U.S. markets, including suburbs of major metropolitan areas.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	We believe these markets are generally less competitive and generate high, stable margins.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our theatres in Latin America are primarily located in major metropolitan markets, which we believe are generally underscreened.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	The following tables summarize the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	We first entered Latin America when we began operating movie theatres in Chile in 1993 and Mexico in 1994.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Since then, through our focused international strategy, we have developed into the most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the region.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, currently operating theatres in twelve of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in Latin America.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	In addition, we have achieved significant scale in Brazil and Mexico, the two largest Latin American economies, with 409 screens in Brazil and 296 screens in Mexico as of December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in Latin American markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	We will continue to build and expand our presence in underserved international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by using local currencies to collect a majority of our revenues and fund a majority of the costs of our international operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	Our international revenues were approximately $564.2 million during 2010 compared to $421.8 million during 2009.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	In the domestic marketplace, the Company s film department negotiates with film distributors, which are made up of the traditional major film companies, specialized and art divisions of some of these major film companies, and many other independent film distributors.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates, the related marketing campaigns and the expenditures related to marketing materials, television spots and other advertising outlets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	The marketing campaign of each movie may include tours of the actors in the movies and coordination of articles and features about each movie.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Company is responsible for booking the films in negotiated film zones, which are either free zones or competitive zones.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	In free zones, movies can be booked without regard to the location of another exhibitor within that area.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	In competitive zones, the distributor allocates their movies to the exhibitors located in that area generally based on demographics and grossing potential of that particular area.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	We are the sole exhibitor in approximately 91% of the 247 film zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P47_S4	In film zones where there is no direct competition from other theatres, we select those films that we believe will be the most successful from those offered to us by film distributors.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Internationally, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	In the international marketplace, films are not allocated to a single theatre in a geographic film zone, but played by competitive theatres simultaneously.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a modern facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable stadium style seating and other amenities typical of modern American-style multiplexes, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	Of the 1,113 screens we operate in international markets, approximately 75% have no direct competition from other theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our film rental fees in the U.S. are generally based on a film s box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms, a sliding scale formula, or a mutually agreed upon settlement, subject to the film licensing agreement.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Internationally, our film rental fees are primarily based on mutually agreed upon firm terms that are based upon a specified percentage of box office receipts.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	We regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres, providing a variety of film choices to our patrons.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Bringing art and independent films to our theatres allows us to benefit from the growth in the art and independent market driven by the more mature patron and increased interest in art, foreign and documentary films.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	High profile film festivals, such as the Sundance Film Festival, have contributed to interest in this genre.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	Recent hits such as The Kids are Alright, Black Swan, and The King s Speech have demonstrated the box office potential of art and independent films.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 30% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	We have devoted considerable management effort to increase concession sales and improve operating margins.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	These efforts include implementation of the following strategies:
1385280_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	We offer concession products that primarily include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juices, candy and quickly-prepared food, such as hot dogs, nachos and ice cream.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Different varieties and flavors of candy and drinks are offered at theatres based on preferences in that particular market.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our point of sale system allows us to monitor product sales and make changes to product mix when necessary, which also allows us to take advantage of national product launches.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Specially priced combos and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase average concession purchases as well as to attract new buyers.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	We periodically offer our loyal patrons opportunities to receive a discount on certain products by offering reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discount off the regular price.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	Employees are continually trained in suggestive-selling and upselling techniques.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	Consumer promotions conducted at the concession stand usually include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving more customers more quickly.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	We have self-service concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices and superior visibility of concession items.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P58_S4	Concession designs in many of our new domestic theatres have incorporated the self-service model.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Concession supplies are distributed through a national distribution network.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	The concession distributor supplies and distributes inventory to the theatres, who place orders directly with the vendors to replenish stock.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	We conduct a weekly inventory of all concession products at each theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained for business.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	NCM s primary activities that impact our theatres include: advertising through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program, lobby promotions and displays; live and pre-recorded networked and single-site meetings and events; and live and pre-recorded concerts, sporting events and other non-film entertainment programming.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S3	We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S4	In addition, we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S5	As of December 31, 2010, we had an approximate 15% ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P61_S6	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	In many of our international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	In some locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	During 2007, we, AMC Entertainment Inc., or AMC, and Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, entered into a joint venture known as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners LLC, or DCIP, to facilitate the implementation of digital cinema in our U.S. theatres and to establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the financing of digital cinema.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Digital cinema developments are managed by DCIP, subject to certain approvals by us, AMC and Regal with each of us having an equal voting interest in DCIP.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	DCIP s wholly-owned subsidiary Kasima executed long-term deployment agreements with all of the major motion picture studios, under which Kasima receives a virtual print fee from such studios for each digital presentation.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	In accordance with these agreements, the digital projection systems deployed by Kasima comply with the technology and security specifications developed by the Digital Cinema Initiatives studio consortium.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	Kasima leases digital projection systems to us, AMC and Regal under master lease agreements that have an initial term of 12 years.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	On March 10, 2010, we signed a master lease agreement and other related agreements (collectively the agreements ) with Kasima.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	Upon signing these agreements, we contributed cash and our existing digital projection systems to DCIP.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	Subsequent to the contributions, we continue to have a 33% voting interest in DCIP and have a 24.3% economic interest in DCIP.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had 1,363 digital auditoriums in the U.S., 1,136 of which are capable of exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	We ultimately expect to install digital projection systems in all of our auditoriums, with approximately 40-50% being 3-D compatible.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	In our international markets, we continue to convert our auditoriums to digital projection technology.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	The digital projection systems we deploy are generally funded with operating cash flows generated by each international country.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had 201 digital auditoriums in our international markets, all of which are capable of exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P68_S3	Similar to our domestic markets, we expect to install digital projection systems in all of our international auditoriums.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	In the U.S., we rely on Internet advertising and also newspaper directory film schedules.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Radio and television advertising spots are used to promote certain motion pictures and special events.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	We exhibit previews of coming attractions and films we are currently playing as part of our pre-feature program.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	We offer patrons access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets at home and purchase gift cards at our Web site www.cinemark.com .
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S3	Customers subscribing to our weekly email receive targeted information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about advanced tickets, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and exclusive coupons for concession savings.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S4	We partner with film distributors to use monthly web contests to drive traffic to our Web site and to ensure that customers visit often.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S5	In addition, we work with all of the film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films with local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S6	These programs may involve customer contests, cross-promotions with the media and third parties and other means to increase patronage for a particular film showing at one of our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P70_S7	We are also developing an iPhone application in the U.S. that will allow patrons to check showtimes and purchase tickets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Internationally, we exhibit upcoming and current film previews on screen, we partner with film distributors for certain promotions and advertise our new locations through various forms of media and events.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	We partner with large multi-national corporations in the large metropolitan areas in which we have theatres to promote our brand, our image and to increase attendance levels at our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	Our customers are encouraged to register on our Web site to receive weekly information by email for showtime information, invitations to special screenings, sponsored events and promotional information.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	In addition, our customers can request to receive showtime information on their cell phones.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S4	We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S5	In addition, the Company has just introduced an iPhone application in Brazil ranking among the top ten downloads in Brazil s local Apple stores.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P71_S6	The application allows consumers to check showtimes and purchase tickets for our Brazil theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on maximizing ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	We market these programs to such business representatives as realtors, human resource managers, incentive program managers and hospital and pharmaceutical personnel.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Gift cards can be purchased for certain of our locations at our theatres or online through our Web site, www.cinemark.com .
1385280_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	SuperSavers are also sold online at www.cinemark.com or via phone, fax or email by our local corporate offices and are also available at certain retailers in the U.S.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our patrons may purchase advance tickets for all of our domestic screens and approximately seventy-five percent of our international screens by accessing our corporate Web site at www.cinemark.com.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Advance tickets may also be purchased for our domestic screens at www.fandango.com.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	Our iPhone application in Brazil currently offers, and the iPhone application we are developing in the U.S. will offer, patrons the ability to purchase tickets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P74_S3	Our Internet initiatives help improve customer satisfaction, allowing patrons who purchase tickets over the Internet to often bypass lines at the box office by printing their tickets at home or picking up their tickets at kiosks located at the theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	We have developed our own proprietary point of sale system to enhance our ability to maximize revenues, control costs and efficiently manage operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	The system is currently installed in all of our U.S. theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	The point of sale system provides corporate management with real-time admissions and concession revenues data and reports to allow for timely changes to movie schedules, including extending film runs, increasing the number of screens on which successful movies are being played, or substituting films when gross receipts do not meet expectations.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	Real-time seating, as well as Reserved Seating, and box office information is available to box office personnel, preventing overselling of a particular film and providing faster and more accurate responses to customer inquiries regarding showtimes and available seating.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	The system tracks concession sales by product, provides in-theatre inventory reports for efficient inventory management and control, offers numerous ticket pricing options, connects with digital concession signage for real-time pricing modifications, integrates Internet ticket sales and processes credit card transactions.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P76_S3	Barcode scanners, pole displays, touch screens, credit card readers and other equipment are integrated with the system to enhance its functions and provide print at home and mobile ticketing.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P76_S4	In our international locations, we currently use other point of sale systems that have been developed by third parties, which have been certified as compliant with applicable governmental regulations and provide generally the same capabilities as our proprietary point of sale system.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry in terms of both attendance and the number of screens in operation.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting patrons, licensing films and developing new theatre sites.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	We are the sole exhibitor in approximately 91% of the 247 film zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	In film zones where there is no direct competition from other theatres, we select those films that we believe will be the most successful from those offered to us by film distributors.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P78_S2	Where there is competition, the distributor allocates their movies to the exhibitors located in that area generally based on demographics and grossing potential of that particular area.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Of the 1,113 screens we operate outside of the U.S., approximately 75% of those screens have no direct competition from other theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	In areas where we face direct competition, our success in attracting patrons depends on location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	The competition for film licensing in the U.S. is dependent upon factors such as the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and revenue potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues, with securing a potential site being dependent upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue and patron potential, and financial stability.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Plano, Texas.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight for our domestic and international theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	Domestic personnel at our corporate headquarters include our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, concessions, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, legal, finance and accounting, audit, information systems support and marketing.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our U.S. operations are divided into sixteen regions, primarily organized geographically, each of which is headed by a region leader.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	International personnel at our corporate headquarters include our President of Cinemark International, L.L.C. and department heads in charge of film licensing, concessions, theatre operations, theatre construction, real estate, legal, audit, information systems and accounting.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	We have eight regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in thirteen individual countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are operated out of one Central American regional office).
1385280_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	Each regional office is headed by a general manager and includes personnel in film licensing, marketing, human resources, information systems, operations and accounting.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P85_S3	We have a chief financial officer in both Brazil and Mexico, which are our two largest international markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P85_S4	The regional offices are staffed with experienced personnel from the region to mitigate cultural and operational barriers.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	We have approximately 14,600 employees in the U.S., approximately 10% of whom are full time employees and 90% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	We have approximately 7,400 employees in our international markets, approximately 63% of whom are full time employees and approximately 37% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	Some of our U.S. employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, and some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P86_S3	We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors is subject to consent decrees resulting from these cases.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including us, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	We develop new theatres to be accessible to the disabled and we believe we are substantially compliant with current regulations relating to accommodating the disabled.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	Although we believe that our theatres comply with the ADA, we have been a party to lawsuits which claim that our handicapped seating arrangements do not comply with the ADA or that we are required to provide captioning for patrons who are deaf or are severely hearing impaired.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and licensing.
1385280_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business depends on film production and performance.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with six major film distributors accounting for approximately 82.7% of U.S. box office revenues and 47 of the top 50 grossing films during 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from these antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The consent decrees bind certain major film distributors to license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the six major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The motion picture industry is highly competitive.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and revenue potential of each theatre and licensing terms.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	An increase in the use of alternative or downstream film distribution channels and other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels or competing forms of entertainment could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video release windows.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Over the last decade, the average video release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available on DVD, an important downstream market, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If patrons choose to wait for a DVD release rather than attend a theatre for viewing the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Film studios have announced their intention to offer consumers a premium video on demand option for certain films 60 days following the theatrical release, which would also cause the release window to shrink further.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We cannot assure you that these release windows, which are determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had $1,532.5 million in long-term debt obligations, $140.2 million in capital lease obligations and $1,795.2 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We incurred interest expense of $112.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We incurred $255.7 million of facility lease expense under operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the terms under these operating leases, excluding optional renewal periods, range from one to 27 years).
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk to you by:
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in the loss of your investment.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We have 137 theatres with 1,113 screens in thirteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Brazil and Mexico represented approximately 14.8% and 3.3% of our consolidated 2010 revenues, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P27_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and transfers abroad, all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our international operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In 2005, we joined Regal and AMC as founding members of NCM, a provider of digital advertising content and digital non-film event content.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 15%.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, the Company received approximately $5.7 million and $5.0 in other revenues from NCM, respectively, and $20.8 million and $23.4 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	NCM also competes with other cinema advertising companies and with hotels, conference centers, arenas, restaurants and convention facilities for its non-film related events to be shown or held in our auditoriums.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to uncertainties related to digital cinema, including insufficient financing to obtain digital projectors and insufficient supply of digital projectors.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We, along with some of our competitors, began a roll-out of digital projection equipment for exhibiting feature films during 2009 and plan to continue our domestic roll-out through our joint venture DCIP.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	However, significant obstacles may exist that impact such a roll-out plan including the cost of digital projectors and the supply of projectors by manufacturers.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	the deployment of digital projectors in approximately 71% of our domestic theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We cannot assure you that DCIP will be able to obtain sufficient additional financing to be able to purchase and lease to us the number of digital projectors needed for our domestic roll-out or that the manufacturers will be able to supply the volume of projectors needed for our worldwide roll-out.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	As a result, our roll-out of digital equipment could be delayed.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Additionally, there is no local financing available to finance the deployment of digital projectors for our international theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Accordingly, the cost of digital projection systems and manufacturer limitations may delay our international deployment.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We cannot assure you that our expansion strategy will result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing or that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we do not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In March 1999, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, filed suit against us in Ohio alleging certain violations of the ADA relating to wheelchair seating arrangements in certain of our stadium-style theatres and seeking remedial action.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We and the DOJ have resolved this lawsuit and a consent order was entered by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, on November 15, 2004.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Under the consent order, we were required to make modifications to wheelchair seating locations in fourteen stadium-style movie theatres and spacing and companion seating modifications in 67 auditoriums at other stadium-styled movie theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	These modifications were completed by November 2009.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Upon completion of these modifications, these theatres comply with wheelchair seating requirements, and no further modifications will be required to our other stadium-style movie theatres in the United States existing on the date of the consent order.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In addition, under the consent order, the DOJ approved the seating plans for nine stadium-styled movie theatres then under construction and also created a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S6	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S7	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P40_S8	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	management team or a key employee could significantly harm us.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We assess many factors when determining whether to impair individual theatre assets, including actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the theatre assets, the theatre assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during the first, second and third quarters of 2008 and six and a half times for the evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the evaluations performed during 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Since we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We have a significant amount of goodwill.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step would be performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Fair values are determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could negatively affect our estimated fair values and could result in further impairments of goodwill.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill allocated to reporting units where the estimated fair value was less than 10% more than the carrying value was approximately $77 million.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We also have a significant amount of tradename intangible assets.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of tradename intangible assets where the estimated fair value was less than 10% more than the carrying value was approximately $136 million.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We recorded asset impairment charges, including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, of $113.5 million, $11.8 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We cannot assure you that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future, and such charges may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P60_S2	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The impairment or insolvency of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We have exposure to different counterparties with regard to our interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties to such agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	We also have exposure to financial institutions used as depositories of our corporate cash balances.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P62_S3	If our counterparties or financial institutions become impaired or insolvent, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or impair our ability to access our cash.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the United States and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The interests of Madison Dearborn Capital Partners IV, L.P., or MDCP, may not be aligned with yours.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	MDCP beneficially owns approximately 21% of our common stock and under a director nomination agreement, is entitled to designate nominees for five members of our board of directors.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Accordingly, MDCP has influence and effectively controls our corporate and management policies and has significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	MDCP could seek to take other actions that might be desirable to MDCP but that might not be desirable for other stockholders.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to you.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Certain provisions of our 8.625% senior notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of our 8.625% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued unpaid interest to the date of the purchase.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P77_S2	A change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The market price of our common stock may be volatile.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will continue.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and the market prices of the securities of companies have been particularly volatile.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	This market volatility, as well as general economic or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors and, in response, the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly and prevent investors from reselling their shares of our common stock at or above a market price that is favorable to other stockholders.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs, liabilities and a diversion of management s attention and resources.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Future sales of our common stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	If a large number of shares of our common stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our common stock could decrease.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P83_S1	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of 182,889,297 shares of our common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P83_S3	In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P83_S4	We may issue shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had 113,750,844 shares of our common stock outstanding.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Of these shares, approximately 75,573,390 shares were freely tradable.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P84_S2	The remaining shares of our common stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our existing stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of common stock.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	upon exercise of options outstanding as of December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	The sale of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options could further dilute your investment in our common stock and adversely affect our stock price.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P88_S1	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the United States to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_11_ITEM1A_P88_S4	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2010, in the U.S., we operated 251 theatres with 3,241 screens pursuant to leases and own the land and building for 42 theatres with 591 screens.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our leases are generally entered into on a long-term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 20 to 45 years.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2010, approximately 10% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 24 theatres with 198 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of less than six years.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	Approximately 10% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 24 theatres with 199 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of between six and 15 years and approximately 80% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 203 theatres with 2,844 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of more than 15 years.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	The leases generally provide for a fixed monthly minimum rent payment, with certain leases also subject to additional percentage rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P0_S5	We also lease an office building in Plano, Texas for our corporate headquarters.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2010, internationally, we operated 137 theatres with 1,113 screens, all of which are leased.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our international leases are generally entered into on a long term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	The leases generally provide for contingent rental based upon operating results with an annual minimum.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2010, approximately 6% of our international theatre leases, covering eight theatres with 62 screens, have a remaining term, including optional renewal periods, of less than six years.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P1_S4	Approximately 39% of our international theatre leases, covering 54 theatres and 446 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of between six and 15 years and approximately 55% of our international theatre leases, covering 75 theatres and 605 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of more than 15 years.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P1_S5	We also lease office space in eight regions in Latin America for our local management.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our minimum lease commitments.
1385280_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	We periodically review the profitability of each of our theatres, particularly those whose lease terms are nearing expiration, to determine whether to continue its operations.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	On December 10, 2010, we were made a party to a putative class action claim in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Monetary damages are also sought on behalf of all hearing-disabled patrons of our theatres in California.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	This case is in an early pretrial phase.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	We intend to vigorously defend this suit.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	We are currently unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss related to this matter.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	From time to time, we are involved in other various legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business operations, such as personal injury claims, employment matters, landlord-tenant disputes, patent claims and contractual disputes, some of which are covered by insurance or by indemnification from vendors.
1385280_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	We believe our potential liability, with respect to these types of proceedings currently pending, is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common equity consists of common stock, which has traded on the New York Stock Exchange since April 24, 2007 under the symbol CNK.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 25, 2011, there were 117 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	In August 2007, we initiated a quarterly dividend policy, which was amended in November 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	Below is a summary of dividends paid for the fiscal periods indicated:
1385280_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	Beginning with the dividend declared on November 2, 2010, our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per common share.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	We, at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock.
1385280_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.

1385280_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following table provides our selected consolidated financial and operating data for the periods and at the dates indicated for each of the five most recent years ended December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	On October 5, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Century Theatres, Inc., or Century.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	Results of operations reflect the inclusion of the Century theatres beginning on the date of acquisition.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	You should read the selected consolidated financial and operating data set forth below in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	For the purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income (loss) before income taxes plus fixed charges excluding capitalized interest.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	Fixed charges consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of debt issue costs and that portion of rental expense which we believe to be representative of the interest factor.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2008, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $27.1 million.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	Includes the cash portion of the Century acquisition purchase price of $531.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	The data excludes certain theatres operated by us in the U.S. pursuant to management agreements that are not part of our consolidated operations.
1385280_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	The data excludes certain theatres operated internationally through our affiliates that are not part of our consolidated operations.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	We generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our contracts with NCM have assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising, third party branding, and the use of our domestic theatres for alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded concert events, the opera, sports programs, and other cultural events.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2010 included the carryover of Avatar, which grossed approximately $475 million in U.S. box office revenues during 2010 and new releases such as Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Iron Man 2, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Inception, Despicable Me, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek Forever After, Clash of the Titans, The Karate Kid, Tangled, Grown Ups, Megamind, Tron: Legacy, Little Fockers, The Fighter and True Grit.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our revenues are affected by changes in attendance and concession revenues per patron.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Attendance is primarily affected by the quality and quantity of films released by motion picture studios.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	Kung Fu Panda 2: The Kaboom of Doom, Cars 2, X Men: First Class, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 2, Twilight:
1385280_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	The First Avenger, Cowboys and Aliens, Puss in Boots, Happy Feet 2, Sherlock Holmes 2 and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked , among other films.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P5_S5	The monthly cost of these advertisements is based on, among other things, the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Utilities and other costs include certain costs that have both fixed and variable components such as utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following:
1385280_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions and concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Percentage rent expense is recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target will be reached.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	The estimate of percentage rent expense recorded during the year is based on historical and forecasted annual revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted based on actual revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lease term.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The remainder of the useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during the first, second and third quarters of 2008 and six and a half times for the evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the evaluations performed during 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	We reduced the multiple we used to determine fair value during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the dramatic decline in estimated market values that resulted from a significant decrease in our stock price and the declines in our and our competitors market capitalizations that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of our sixteen regions in the U.S. and each of our eight international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The evaluation is a two-step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill allocated to reporting units where the estimated fair value was less than 10% more than the carrying value was approximately $77 million.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could negatively affect our estimated fair values and could result in further impairments of goodwill.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of tradename intangible assets where the estimated fair value was less than 10% more than the carrying value was approximately $136 million.

1385280_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.

1385280_11_ITEM7_P84_S5	We reduced the multiple from eight times cash flows to six and a half times cash flows, which significantly reduced our estimated fair values.

1385280_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	The loss recorded during 2009 was primarily related to the write-off of theatre equipment that was replaced.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	The loss recorded during 2008 was primarily related to the write-off of theatre equipment that was replaced, the write-off of prepaid rent for an international theatre, and damages to certain of our theatres in Texas related to Hurricane Ike.

1385280_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	During 2009, we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of $27.9 million as a result of the tender and call premiums paid and other fees related to the repurchase of approximately $419.4 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of Cinemark, Inc. s 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes and the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs associated with these notes.
1385280_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	During 2008, we recorded a gain on early retirement of debt of $1.7 million as a result of the repurchase of $47.0 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of Cinemark, Inc. s 9 3 / 4 % senior discount notes partially offset by the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs.

1385280_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	The effective tax rate of (90.1)% for 2008 reflects the impact of our 2008 goodwill impairment charges, which are not deductible for income tax purposes.

1385280_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	The increase in cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily due to the acquisition of four theatres in the U.S. for approximately $49.0 million (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements) and the acquisition of one theatre in Brazil for approximately $9.1 million.

1385280_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or fraud.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P10_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P10_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P11_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P11_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P13_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_11_ITEM9A_P14_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Basis of Presentation On August 2, 2006, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. was formed as the Delaware holding company of Cinemark, Inc.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	On April 24, 2007, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P20_S2	Effective December 11, 2009, Cinemark, Inc. was merged into Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. became the holding company of Cinemark USA, Inc.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P21_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P21_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P21_S4	Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating funds held in financial institutions, petty cash held by the theatres and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	At December 31, 2010, cash investments were primarily in money market funds or other similar funds.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Inventories Concession and theatre supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	Theatre Properties and Equipment Theatre properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during the first, second and third quarters of 2008 and six and a half times for the evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the evaluations performed during 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	The Company reduced the multiple it used to determine fair value during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the dramatic decline in estimated market values that resulted from a significant decrease in its stock price and the declines in the market capitalizations of the Company and its competitors that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P31_S3	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of theatre businesses acquired.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P32_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its sixteen regions in the U.S. and each of its eight international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the Company s tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from 1 to 12 years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from 1 to 27 years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	The remaining term of the underlying agreements range from 4 to 10 years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of debt issue costs, long-term prepaid rents, construction advances and other deposits, equipment to be placed in service, interest rate swap assets and other assets.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	Debt issue costs are amortized using the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over the primary financing terms of the related debt agreement.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Long-term prepaid rents represent advance rental payments on operating leases.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	These payments are recognized to facility lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	The amortization periods generally range from 1 to 10 years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P46_S3	See Note 14 for discussion of interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	If substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership have been transferred to the lessee, the Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P49_S4	At the end of the construction period, the Company determines if the transaction qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment in regards to lease classification.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	Revenues related to these advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	Casualty Insurance The Company is self-insured for general liability claims up to $250 per occurrence with an annual cap of approximately $2,650 per policy year and is self-insured for medical claims up to $125 per occurrence.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	The Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, the Company maintained insurance reserves of $8,022 and $7,447, respectively, which is reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions and concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advance sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $7,629, $7,162 and $7,073 during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Under the sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P57_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P57_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P57_S4	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and the Company expensed $16,839, $15,104 and $16,147, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model, consistent with the terms of the award, or a market observed price, if such a price exists.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P58_S3	The Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited, rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P58_S4	See Note 19 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P59_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	The first step is recognition: The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P62_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	Segments As of December 31, 2010, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P65_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company has interest rate swap agreements that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P70_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P70_S3	Therefore, the Company s measurements use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P70_S4	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period, no transfers in or out of Level 3 and no gains or losses included in earnings that were attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to the Company s current interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P70_S5	See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company s interest rate swap agreements and Note 15 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P71_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company provides the assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P72_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P72_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	In December 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810) Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities ( ASU No. 2009-17 ).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	This update changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on, among other things, the other entity s purpose and design and the reporting entity s ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity s economic performance.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	ASU No. 2009-17 requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P74_S2	A reporting entity is required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity s financial statements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	ASU No. 2009-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company considers its unvested share based payment awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities, and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	Basic earnings per share for the two classes of stock (common stock and unvested restricted stock) is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock plus the potentially dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding determined under both the two class method and the treasury stock method.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	The following table presents computations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under the two class method:

1385280_11_ITEM15_P177_S1	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into any of its interest rate swap agreements because the pay rates and receive rates on the interest rate swap agreements represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time each of the interest rate swap agreements was consummated.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P178_S0	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P178_S1	The Company s current interest rate swap agreements exhibited no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P179_S0	The valuation technique used to determine fair value is the income approach and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	Therefore, the Company s measurements use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P181_S1	Prior to the counterparty s credit rating downgrade, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P181_S2	Subsequent to the counterparty s credit rating downgrade, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded in earnings as a component of interest expense.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P181_S3	The Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement during October 2008.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P181_S4	The Company determined that the forecasted transactions hedged by this interest rate swap are still probable to occur, thus the total amount previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to this interest rate swap agreement of $18,147 is being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the period during which the forecasted transactions are expected to occur, which is September 15, 2008 through August 13, 2012.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P182_S0	$4,633 to interest expense during each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S0	Restricted Stock Units During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, the Company granted restricted stock units representing 204,361, 303,168 and 396,429 hypothetical shares of common stock, respectively, under the Restated Incentive Plan.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S1	The restricted stock units vest based on a combination of financial performance factors and continued service.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S2	The financial performance factors are based on an implied equity value concept that determines an internal rate of return ( IRR ) during a three fiscal year period based on a formula utilizing a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA subject to certain specified adjustments (as defined in the restricted stock unit award agreement).
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S3	The financial performance factors for the restricted stock units have a threshold, target and maximum level of payment opportunity.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S4	If the IRR for the three year period is at least 8.5%, which is the threshold, one-third of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S5	If the IRR for the three year period is at least 10.5%, which is the target, two-thirds of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S6	If the IRR for the three year period is at least 12.5%, which is the maximum, 100% of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S7	All payouts of restricted stock units that vest will be subject to an additional one year service requirement and will be paid in the form of common stock if the participant continues to provide services through the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P229_S8	Restricted stock unit award participants are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments if and at the time the restricted stock unit awards vest.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P230_S0	Below is a table summarizing the potential number of shares that could vest under restricted stock unit awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 at each of the three levels of financial performance (excluding forfeitures):
1385280_11_ITEM15_P231_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Company s board of directors approved a modification of restricted stock unit awards granted to employees during 2008.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P231_S1	The Compensation Committee also approved the cancellation and replacement of restricted stock unit awards granted to the Company s top five executive officers during 2008.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P231_S2	Both the modification and the cancellation and replacement were accounted for as modifications of share based awards.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P231_S3	As a result of these modifications, the Company recorded incremental compensation expense of approximately $435 during the year ended December 31, 2010, which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the modification date fair value of these awards for the portion of the service period that has been satisfied.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P231_S4	The service period for the modified awards did not change.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P231_S5	The Company will record additional incremental compensation expense of $261 over the remaining service period.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P232_S0	At the time of each of the 2008 and 2009 restricted stock unit grants, the Company was not able to determine which IRR level would be reached for the respective three year performance period, therefore the Company assumed the mid-point IRR level for both grants in determining the amount of compensation expense to record for such grants.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P232_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, based upon additional information, the Company determined that the 12.5% IRR level will be reached for the 2008 grant and the 12.5% IRR level is expected to be reached for the 2009 grant.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P232_S2	The Company recorded additional compensation expense of approximately $823 for the 2008 restricted stock unit grant and $377 for the 2009 restricted stock unit grant during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P233_S0	Due to the fact that the IRR for the three year performance period could not be determined at the time of the 2010 grant, the Company estimated that the most likely outcome is the achievement of the mid-point IRR level.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P233_S1	The Company assumed a forfeiture rate of 5% for the restricted stock unit awards.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P234_S0	If during the service period, additional information becomes available to lead the Company to believe a different IRR level will be achieved for the three year performance periods, the Company will reassess the number of units that will vest for the respective grant and adjust its compensation expense accordingly on a prospective basis over the remaining service period.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P235_S0	As of December 31, 2010, no restricted stock unit awards had vested.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P235_S1	There were no forfeitures of restricted stock unit awards during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P235_S2	The Company recorded compensation expense of $326, $759 and $3,424 related to these restricted stock unit awards during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P235_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had restricted stock units outstanding that represented a total of 884,040 hypothetical shares of common stock, net of actual cumulative forfeitures of 19,918 units, assuming the maximum IRR of at least 12.5% is achieved for all of the grants.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P235_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $6,389, which assumes the high-point IRR level has been achieved for the 2008 grant, the high-point IRR level will be achieved for the 2009 grant and the mid-point IRR level will be achieved for the 2010 grant.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P235_S5	The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P236_S0	The following is provided as supplemental information to the consolidated statements of cash flows:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P237_S0	During 2008, the Company elected to use the proceeds of approximately $2,089 from the sale of real properties to pursue the purchase of like-kind properties in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and as a result, the proceeds were deposited to an escrow account.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P237_S1	The Company did not purchase like-kind properties and the deposits of approximately $24,828 were returned to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2008.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P238_S0	Income (loss) before income taxes consisted of the following:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P239_S0	A reconciliation between income tax expense and taxes computed by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes follows:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P240_S0	The Company reinvests the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of its subsidiary in Ecuador.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P240_S1	Accordingly, deferred U.S. federal and state income taxes are provided only on the undistributed earnings of the Company s Ecuador subsidiary.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P241_S0	undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries on which the Company has not recognized income taxes was approximately $254,000.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P242_S0	The tax effects of significant temporary differences and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards comprising the net long-term deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2010 consisted of the following:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Company s valuation allowance against deferred tax assets decreased from $18,228 at December 31, 2009 to $15,425 at December 31, 2010.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P243_S1	The change in the valuation allowance was primarily due to realization of deferred tax assets for the Company s Chilean subsidiaries.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P244_S0	The Company s foreign tax credit carryforwards begin expiring in 2015.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P244_S1	Some foreign net operating losses will expire in the next reporting period; however, some losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P244_S2	State net operating losses may be carried forward for periods of between five and twenty years with the last expiring year being 2029.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P245_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P246_S0	The Company had $31,661 and $19,788 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P246_S1	Of these amounts, $23,212 and $14,339 represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P246_S2	The Company had $7,804 and $4,592 accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and multiple state and foreign jurisdictions, and the Company is routinely under audit by many different tax authorities.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S1	The Company believes that its accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S2	This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S3	The Company is no longer subject to income tax audits from the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2006.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S4	The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major state jurisdictions for years before 2006.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S5	Certain state returns were amended as a result of the Internal Revenue Service examination closures for 2002 through 2005, and the statutes remain open for those amendments.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P247_S6	The Company is no longer subject to non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major non-U.S. tax jurisdictions for years before 2004.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P248_S0	The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2006 and 2007 tax years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P248_S1	It is reasonably possible that these audits could be completed within the next twelve months.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P248_S2	These events could result in a decrease in the Company s total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1,948, which includes approximately $259 of accrued interest.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P249_S0	Leases The Company conducts a significant part of its theatre operations in leased properties under noncancelable operating and capital leases with terms generally ranging from 10 to 25 years.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P249_S1	In addition to the minimum annual lease payments, some of the leases provide for contingent rentals based on operating results of the theatre and most require the payment of taxes, insurance and other costs applicable to the property.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P249_S2	The Company can renew, at its option, a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then market rental rates for various periods.
1385280_11_ITEM15_P249_S3	Some leases also provide for escalating rent payments throughout the lease term.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P255_S1	The Company believes its potential liability with respect to these types of proceedings currently pending is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P294_S0	I, Alan W. Stock, the Chief Executive Officer of Issuer certify that to the best of my knowledge:
1385280_11_ITEM15_P295_S0	(ii) the information contained in the Form 10-K fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer.

1385280_11_ITEM15_P301_S0	Subscribed and sworn to before me this 28th day of February 2011.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with six major film distributors accounting for approximately 83% of U.S. box office revenues and 46 of the top 50 grossing films during 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from these antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The consent decrees bind certain major film distributors to license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the six major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The motion picture industry is highly competitive.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and revenue potential of each theatre and licensing terms.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	An increase in the use of alternative or downstream film distribution channels and other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels or competing forms of entertainment could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video release windows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Over the last decade, the average video release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available on DVD, an important downstream market, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If patrons choose to wait for a DVD release rather than attend a theatre for viewing the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Film studios have started to offer consumers a premium video on demand option for certain films 60 days following the theatrical release, which caused the release window to shrink further for certain films.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We cannot assure you that these release windows, which are determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,572.2 million in long-term debt obligations, $141.2 million in capital lease obligations and $1,904.0 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We incurred interest expense of $123.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We incurred $276.3 million of facility lease expense under operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the terms under these operating leases, excluding optional renewal periods, range from one to 25 years).
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk to you by:
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or the proceeds may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in the loss of your investment.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We have 159 theatres with 1,274 screens in thirteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Brazil represented approximately 15.7% of our consolidated 2011 revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and transfers abroad, all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our international operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In 2005, we joined Regal and AMC as founding members of NCM, a provider of digital advertising content and digital non-film event content.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 16%.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company received approximately $5.0 million and $5.9 million in other revenues from NCM, respectively, and $23.4 million and $24.2 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	NCM also competes with other cinema advertising companies and with hotels, conference centers, arenas, restaurants and convention facilities for its non-film related events to be shown or held in our auditoriums.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to uncertainties related to digital cinema, including insufficient financing to obtain digital projectors and insufficient supply of digital projectors for our international locations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We began a roll-out of digital projection equipment in our international theatres during 2009 which has been funded by operating cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	There is no local financing available to finance the deployment of digital projectors for our international theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Accordingly, the cost of digital projection systems and manufacturer limitations may delay our international deployment.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We cannot assure you that our expansion strategy will result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing or that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If we do not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	On November 15, 2004, we and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S7	The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly harm us.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S9	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S10	We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S11	We assess many factors when determining whether to impair individual theatre assets, including actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P22_S12	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the theatre assets, the theatre assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2009, 2010 and 2011.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Since we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have a significant amount of goodwill.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using a two-step approach under which we compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step would be performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Fair values are determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2009 and 2010 and seven and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2011.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could negatively affect our estimated fair values and could result in further impairments of goodwill.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their estimated carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We also have a significant amount of tradename intangible assets.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their estimated carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We recorded asset impairment charges, including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, of $11.8 million, $12.5 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We cannot assure you that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future, and such charges may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	While we are continuing to transition our theatres to digital projection technology, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The impairment or insolvency of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have exposure to different counterparties with regard to our interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We also have exposure to financial institutions used as depositories of our corporate cash balances.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If our counterparties or financial institutions become impaired or insolvent, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or impair our ability to access our cash.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the United States and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to you.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of our 8.625% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued unpaid interest to the date of the purchase.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	A change of control , as defined in the senior subordinated notes indenture, would require us to make an offer to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	A change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common Stock will continue.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and the market prices of the securities of companies have been particularly volatile.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	This market volatility, as well as general economic or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating performance.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors and, in response, the market price of our Common Stock may decrease significantly and prevent investors from reselling their shares of our Common Stock at or above a market price that is favorable to other stockholders.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs, liabilities and a diversion of management s attention and resources.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P44_S5	As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of 181,286,739 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our existing stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there were 9,214,191 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, of which 82,166 shares of Common Stock were issuable upon exercise of options outstanding as of December 31, 2011.

1385280_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P46_S4	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	other efforts in the United States to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.

1385280_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	The monthly cost of these advertisements is based on, among other things, the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Utilities and other costs include certain costs that have both fixed and variable components such as utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P11_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S6	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S7	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S8	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P15_S9	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lease term.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2009, 2010 and 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of our sixteen regions in the U.S. and each of our eight international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The evaluation is a two-step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2009 and 2010 and seven and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by at least 10%.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc. , a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA ) with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P43_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income (loss) of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Recent Developments Dividend Declaration On February 3, 2012 our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $0.21 per common share payable to stockholders of record on March 2, 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The dividend will be paid on March 16, 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	On August 25, 2011, we purchased ten theatres with 95 screens in Argentina.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The results of operations for these theatres are included in our results beginning on the date of acquisition.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	(1) All costs are expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except film rentals and advertising, which are expressed as a percentage of admissions revenues and concession supplies, which are expressed as a percentage of concession revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 Revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Total revenues increased $138.5 million to $2,279.6 million for 2011 from $2,141.1 million for 2010, representing a 6.5% increase.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.

1385280_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The increase in admissions revenues of $66.2 million was primarily attributable to a 2.6% increase in attendance and a 2.1% increase in average ticket price from $5.83 for 2010 to $5.95 for 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The increase in concession revenues of $54.5 million was primarily attributable to the 2.6% increase in attendance and a 6.0% increase in concession revenues per patron from $2.66 for 2010 to $2.82 for 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to incremental 3-D and premium pricing and other price increases and the favorable impact of exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to price increases and the favorable impact of exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	The 19.1% increase in other revenues was primarily due to increases in international ancillary revenue.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	The decrease in admissions revenues of $11.1 million was primarily attributable to a 1.7% decrease in attendance for 2011, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in average ticket price from $6.48 for 2010 to $6.52 for 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase in concession revenues of $15.5 million was primarily attributable to a 5.0% increase in concession revenues per patron from $3.03 for 2010 to $3.18 for 2011, partially offset by the 1.7% decrease in attendance for 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to incremental 3-D and premium pricing and other price increases, and the increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales and price increases.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The increase in admissions revenues of $77.3 million was primarily attributable to an 11.1% increase in attendance and a 9.3% increase in average ticket price from $4.51 for 2010 to $4.93 for 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in concession revenues of $39.0 million was primarily attributable to the 11.1% increase in attendance and a 13.0% increase in concession revenues per patron from $1.93 for 2010 to $2.18 for 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to incremental 3-D and premium pricing and other price increases and the favorable impact of exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to price increases and the favorable impact of exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	The 31.8% increase in other revenues was primarily due to increases in ancillary revenue.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Film rentals and advertising costs were $798.6 million, or 54.3% of admissions revenues, for 2011 compared to $769.7 million, or 54.8% of admissions revenues, for 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase in film rentals and advertising costs of $28.9 million was primarily due to the $66.2 million increase in admissions revenues, partially offset by the decrease in our film rentals and advertising rate.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	The decrease in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to lower film rental rates in the U.S. segment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Concession supplies expense was $112.1 million, or 16.1% of concession revenues, for 2011 compared to $97.5 million, or 15.2% of concession revenues, for 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S4	The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to increases in inventory procurement costs and the increased weighting of our international segment, which generally has higher procurement costs.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S5	Salaries and wages increased to $226.5 million for 2011 from $221.2 million for 2010 primarily due to increases in our international segment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P55_S6	Facility lease expense increased to $276.3 million for 2011 from $255.7 million for 2010 primarily due to new theatres, increased percentage rent related to the 6.5% increase in revenues and the impact of exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.

1385280_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $574.2 million, or 55.6% of admissions revenues, for 2011 compared to $586.6 million, or 56.2% of admissions revenues, for 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in film rentals and advertising costs of $12.4 million was primarily due to the $11.1 million decrease in admissions revenues and a decrease in the film rentals and advertising rate primarily due to fewer blockbuster films released in 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	Concession supplies expense was $64.0 million, or 12.7% of concession revenues, for 2011, compared to $59.1 million, or 12.1% of concession revenues, for 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to increases in inventory procurement costs.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P56_S4	Salaries and wages decreased to $167.5 million for 2011 from $174.1 million for 2010 primarily due to the 1.7% decline in attendance and operating efficiencies achieved with reduced staffing levels.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P56_S5	Facility lease expense increased to $185.8 million for 2011 from $181.9 million for 2010 primarily due to new theatres.

1385280_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS ( ASU No. 2011-04 ).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 provides guidance which is expected to result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	It changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P112_S3	It is not intended for this update to result in a change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P112_S4	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-04 are to be applied prospectively.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	This update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU No. 2011-05 ).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	In ASU No. 2011-05, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S3	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-05 do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S4	They also do not change the presentation of related tax effects or the portrayal or calculation of earnings per share.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S5	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S6	The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S7	Early adoption is permitted, because compliance with the amendments is already permitted.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P114_S8	ASU No. 2011-05 also required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income, however, in December 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	We elected to adopt ASU No. 2011-05 and ASU No. 2011-12 for our fiscal 2011 and amendments have been applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	The amendments do not require any transition disclosures.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) ( ASU No. 2011-08 ).
1385280_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	In ASU No. 2011-08, an entity is permitted to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P116_S2	If an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it would not be required to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	The ASU s objective is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-08 are effective for annual and interim goodwill and impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P117_S3	The adoption of ASU No. 2011-08 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to mid-August, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_12_ITEM7_P118_S3	The timing of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At December 31, 2011, there was an aggregate of approximately $285.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities, which excludes $620.6 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s term loan debt that is hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements as discussed below.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.9 million.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A majority of our current interest rate swap agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Below is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2011:
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2011:
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	(1) Includes $620.6 million of the Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan, which represents the debt currently hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and construction interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, require that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments.
1385280_12_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $50 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 by approximately $8 million and $9 million, respectively.

1385280_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Limitations on Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or fraud.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of Cinemark Holdings, Inc.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P7_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P8_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P8_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_12_ITEM9A_P8_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P22_S1	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P23_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P23_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P23_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P24_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P24_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P25_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P26_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P26_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2009, 2010 and 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P26_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P27_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of theatre businesses acquired.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P27_S1	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P27_S2	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P27_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its sixteen regions in the U.S. and each of its eight international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P28_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P28_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P29_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P29_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2009 and 2010 and seven and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P30_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P31_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the Company s tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P31_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P32_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P33_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P34_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_12_ITEM14_P35_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P35_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from 1 to 11 years.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P36_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P36_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from 1 to 25 years.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P37_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement or the expected useful life of the intangible asset.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P37_S1	The remaining useful lives of these intangible assets range from 2 to 8 years.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P38_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of debt issue costs, long-term prepaid rents, interest rate swap assets, construction related deposits, lease deposits, equipment to be placed in service, and other assets of a long-term nature.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P39_S0	Debt issue costs are amortized using the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over the primary financing terms of the related debt agreement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P40_S0	Long-term prepaid rents represent prepayments of rent on operating leases.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P40_S1	These payments are recognized to facility lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P40_S2	The amortization periods generally range from 1 to 10 years.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P40_S3	See Note 14 for discussion of interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P41_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P41_S1	If substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership have been transferred to the lessee, the Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P42_S0	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P43_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P43_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P43_S2	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P43_S3	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P43_S4	At the end of the construction period, the Company determines if the transaction qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment in regards to lease classification.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P44_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P44_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P44_S2	Revenues related to these advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P45_S0	Casualty Insurance The Company is self-insured for general liability claims subject to an annual cap.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P45_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, claims were capped at $250 per occurrence with an annual cap of approximately $2,650.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P45_S2	The company is also self-insured for medical claims up to $125 per occurrence.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P45_S3	The Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P45_S4	As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the Company s insurance reserves were $7,447 and $7,600, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P46_S0	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P46_S1	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P46_S2	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P46_S3	The Company records proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P46_S4	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P46_S5	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P47_S0	The Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $7,162, $7,073 and $7,846 during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P48_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P48_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P49_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P49_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P50_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P50_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P50_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P50_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P50_S4	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and the Company expensed $15,104, $16,147 and $18,052, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P51_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P51_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model, consistent with the terms of the award, or a market observed price, if such a price exists.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P51_S2	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P51_S3	The Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited, rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P51_S4	See Note 19 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P52_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P52_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P53_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P53_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P54_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P54_S1	The first step is recognition: The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P54_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P55_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P55_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P55_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P56_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P57_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P58_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P58_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P58_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P59_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P59_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P60_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P61_S0	The Company has interest rate swap agreements that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P61_S1	The Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P62_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P63_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P63_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P63_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P63_S3	Therefore, the Company s measurements use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P63_S4	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 3.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P63_S5	See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company s interest rate swap agreements and Note 15 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P64_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P65_S0	value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P65_S1	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P66_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P66_S1	The Company provides the assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P66_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P66_S3	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P66_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P66_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P67_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS ( ASU No. 2011-04 ).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P67_S1	ASU No. 2011-04 provides guidance which is expected to result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P67_S2	It changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P67_S3	It is not intended for this update to result in a change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P67_S4	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-04 are to be applied prospectively.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P68_S0	ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P68_S1	This update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU No. 2011-05 ).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S1	In ASU No. 2011-05, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S3	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-05 do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S4	They also do not change the presentation of related tax effects or the portrayal or calculation of earnings per share.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S5	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S6	The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S7	Early adoption is permitted, because compliance with the amendments is already permitted.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S8	ASU No. 2011-05 also required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income, however, in December 2011 the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05 .
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S9	The update defers the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S10	The Company elected to adopt ASU No. 2011-05 and ASU No. 2011-12 for its fiscal 2011 and amendments have been applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P69_S11	The amendments do not require any transition disclosures.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P70_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) ( ASU No. 2011-08 ).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P71_S0	is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P71_S1	If an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it would not be required to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P72_S0	The ASU s objective is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P72_S1	The amendments in ASU No. 2011-08 are effective for annual and interim goodwill and impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P72_S2	Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P72_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2011-08 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P73_S0	The Company considers its unvested share based payment awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities, and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P74_S0	Basic earnings per share for the two classes of stock (common stock and unvested restricted stock) is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P74_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock plus the potentially dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding determined under both the two class method and the treasury stock method.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P74_S2	The following table presents computations of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two class method:

1385280_12_ITEM14_P83_S0	LLC The Company has an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P83_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P83_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P84_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCMI ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P84_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S0	obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S1	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S2	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S3	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron, initially seven cents, and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for certain reasons outlined in the modified ESA.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S4	The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the first such increase taking effect after the end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S5	For 2009, 2010 and 2011, the annual payment per digital screen was eight hundred eighty-two dollars, nine hundred twenty-six dollars and nine hundred seventy-two dollars, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S6	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal, AMC and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S7	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P85_S8	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 25 years.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P86_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P86_S1	Following the NCM, Inc. IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P86_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P86_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P86_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S0	Common Unit Adjustments Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCMI and the Company, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), which we refer to collectively as the Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, we follow the guidance in FASB ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S2	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S3	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S4	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P87_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P88_S0	method, with undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income (loss) of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P89_S0	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P89_S1	If the Company then elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Tranche 2 Investment at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P90_S0	During March 2009, NCM performed its annual common unit adjustment calculation under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P90_S1	As a result of the calculation, the Company received an additional 1,197,303 common units of NCM, each of which is convertible into one share of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P90_S2	The Company recorded the additional common units received at fair value as part of its Tranche 2 Investment with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue of $15,536.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P91_S0	During March 2010, NCM performed its annual common unit adjustment calculation under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P91_S1	As a result of the calculation, the Company received an additional 1,757,548 common units of NCM, each of which is convertible into one share of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P91_S2	The Company recorded the additional common units received at fair value as part of its Tranche 2 Investment with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue of $30,683.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P92_S0	Subsequent to the annual common unit adjustment discussed above, in May 2010, one of NCM s other founding members completed an acquisition of another theatre circuit that required an extraordinary common unit adjustment calculation by NCM in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P92_S1	As a result of this extraordinary common unit adjustment, the founding member was granted additional common units of NCM, which resulted in dilution of the Company s ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P92_S2	The Company recognized a change of interest gain of approximately $271 during the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of this extraordinary common unit adjustment, which is reflected in (gain) loss on sale of assets and other on the consolidated statement of income.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P93_S0	During March 2011, NCM performed its annual common unit adjustment calculation under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P99_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a 33% voting interest in DCIP and a 24.3% economic interest in DCIP.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P99_S1	The Company accounts for its investment in DCIP and its subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P99_S2	Below is a rollforward of our investment in DCIP from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011:
1385280_12_ITEM14_P100_S0	As a result of the Agreements, the Company has installed digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P100_S1	The digital projection systems are being leased from Kasima under an operating lease with an initial term of twelve years that contains ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P100_S2	The equipment lease agreement also contains a fair value purchase option.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P100_S3	Under the equipment lease agreement, the Company pays minimum annual rent of one thousand dollars per digital projection system for the first six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement and minimum annual rent of three thousand dollars per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date through the end of the lease term.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P100_S4	The Company may also be subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the agreements.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P100_S5	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P101_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had 3,460 digital projection systems being leased under the master equipment lease agreement with Kasima.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P102_S0	The digital projection systems leased from Kasima replaced a majority of the Company s existing 35 millimeter projection systems in its U.S. theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P102_S1	Therefore, upon signing the agreements, the Company began accelerating the depreciation of these existing 35 millimeter projection systems.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P102_S2	The Company recorded depreciation expense of approximately $9,423 and $10,604 on its domestic 35 millimeter projection systems during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P104_S1	The fair value measurement for the Company s investment in RealD transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P104_S2	Previous fair value estimates for the investment were based on RealD s quoted stock price, discounted to reflect the impact of a lock-up period to which the Company was subject.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P104_S3	The lock-up period expired during January 2011; therefore, the fair value estimates for the investment subsequent to January 2011 were based on RealD s stock price with no adjustments.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P104_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company vested in an additional 136,952 RealD options by reaching the final target level, as outlined in the license agreement.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P104_S7	These fair value measurements fall under Level 1 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P105_S0	The deferred lease incentive liability, which is reflected in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, is being amortized over the term of the license agreement, which is approximately seven and one-half years.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P106_S2	The Company has determined that its RealD shares are available-for-sale securities in accordance with ASC Topic 320-10-35-1, therefore unrealized holding gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P106_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the Company owned 1,222,780 shares in RealD, with an estimated fair value of $9,709.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P107_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment on its investment in RealD due to the length of time and extent to which RealD s quoted stock price has been below the Company s basis in the stock.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P107_S1	As a result of the other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reclassified approximately $12,610, which represented cumulative net unrealized holding losses, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P108_S1	Under this option, which was contingent upon completion of an initial public offering of common stock by the Company, the Colombian Partners were entitled to exchange their shares in Cinemark Colombia S.A. for shares of the Company s common stock (the Colombia Share Exchange ).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P108_S2	The number of shares to be exchanged was determined based on the Company s equity value and the equity value of the Colombian Partners interest in Cinemark Colombia S.A., both of which are defined in the Exchange Option Agreement.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P108_S4	The increase in the Company s ownership interest in its Colombian subsidiary was accounted for as an equity transaction.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P108_S5	The Company recorded an increase in common stock and additional-paid-in-capital of approximately $6,951, which represented the book value of the Colombian partners noncontrolling interest account of approximately $5,865 plus the Colombian partners share of accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $1,086.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data Fair Value of Long Term Debt The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt primarily using quoted market prices, which fall under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P141_S1	The carrying value of the Company s long term debt was $1,572,221 and $1,532,441 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P141_S2	The fair value of the Company s long term debt was $1,622,286 and $1,581,963 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P141_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the Company believes it was in full compliance with all agreements, including related covenants, governing its outstanding debt.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P142_S0	(1) Reflects the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the 8.625% senior notes before the original issue discount of $9,470.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P143_S0	INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS The Company is currently a party to five interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P143_S1	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into any of its interest rate swap agreements because the pay rates and receive rates on the interest rate swap agreements represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time each of the interest rate swap agreements was consummated.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P144_S0	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P144_S1	The changes in fair values are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P144_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company reclassified $10,395, $11,771 and $15,929, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P145_S0	The valuation technique used to determine fair value is the income approach and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.

1385280_12_ITEM14_P149_S0	(3) An additional $18,368 of this original $125,000 swap is no longer designated as a hedge as a result of the prepayment of the unextended portion of the Company s term loan debt.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P150_S0	(4) An additional $11,017 of this original $75,000 swap is no longer designated as a hedge as a result of the prepayment of the unextended portion of the Company s term loan debt.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P150_S1	During June 2011, the Company prepaid the remaining unextended portion of its term loan debt under its senior secured credit facility (see Note 13).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P150_S2	As a result, the Company determined that a portion of the quarterly interest payments hedged by two of its current interest rate swap agreements and the quarterly interest payments related to its previously terminated interest rate swap agreement were probable not to occur and therefore reclassified approximately $2,760 of its accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these cash flow hedges to earnings, as a component of loss on early retirement of debt, during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P151_S0	The Company was previously a party to an interest rate swap agreement that was effective during 2007 with a counterparty that filed for bankruptcy during September 2008 and whose credit rating was downgraded as a result.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P151_S1	Prior to the counterparty s credit rating downgrade, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1385280_12_ITEM14_P151_S2	Subsequent to the counterparty s credit rating downgrade, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded in earnings as a component of interest expense.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P151_S3	The Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement during October 2008.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P151_S4	The Company determined that the forecasted transactions hedged by this interest rate swap are still probable to occur, thus the total amount previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to this interest rate swap agreement of $18,147 is being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the period during which the forecasted transactions are expected to occur, which is September 15, 2008 through August 13, 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM14_P151_S5	The Company amortized approximately $4,633, $4,633 and $4,236 to interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we operated 456 theatres and 5,152 screens in the U.S. and Latin America and approximately 247.4 million patrons attended our theatres worldwide during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S2	Our circuit is the third largest in the U.S. with 297 theatres and 3,878 screens in 39 states.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S3	We are the most geographically diverse circuit in Latin America with 159 theatres and 1,274 screens in 13 countries.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S4	Our modern theatre circuit features stadium seating in approximately 87% of our first-run auditoriums.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S5	We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S6	We believe our portfolio of modern theatres provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid cash flows from operating activities.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S7	Our significant presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly as they look to capitalize on the expanding worldwide box office.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P7_S8	Our market leadership is attributable in large part to our senior executives, whose years of industry experience range from 15 to 53 years and who have successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	Revenues, operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $2,279.6 million, $308.6 million and $130.6 million, respectively.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P8_S1	At December 31, 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of $521.4 million and long-term debt of $1,572.2 million.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P8_S2	Approximately $285.3 million, or 18%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and approximately $12.1 million of our long-term debt matures in 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	During 2009, we began converting our circuit from film based to digital projection technology.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S1	Digital projection technology gives us greater flexibility in programming and facilitates the exhibition of live and pre-recorded alternative entertainment.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S2	As of December 31, 2011, 100% of our first run domestic theatres are fully digital and we continue to convert our international theatres to digital.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S3	We also developed a premium experience auditorium concept utilizing large screens and the latest in digital projection and sound technologies, which we call our Cinemark XD Extreme Digital Cinema, or XD.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S4	The XD experience includes wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens, wrap-around sound and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an intense sensory experience.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S5	We charge a premium price for the XD experience.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S6	The XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in the XD auditorium.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P9_S7	We currently have 81 XD auditoriums in our circuit and have plans to install 20 to 30 more XD auditoriums during 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	During 2010, we introduced our NextGen concept, which features wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens and the latest digital projection and sound technologies in all of the auditoriums of a complex.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	These theatres generally also have an XD auditorium, which offers the wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screen in a larger auditorium with enhanced sound and seating.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P10_S2	Most of our future domestic theatres will incorporate this NextGen concept.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2011 five theatres with 55 screens have the NextGen concept.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P10_S4	During 2011, we converted our six existing film-based IMAX screens to digital projection technology and installed two additional digital IMAX systems.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P11_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its transition to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P11_S1	Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail and in a range of up to 35 trillion colors.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P11_S2	Because digital features aren t susceptible to scratching and fading, digital presentations will always remain clear and sharp every time they are shown.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P12_S0	A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P12_S1	The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie and due to its format, it enables us to more efficiently move films between auditoriums within a theatre as demand increases or decreases for each film.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P12_S2	In addition, the transition to digital technology may reduce production and distribution costs as it will eliminate the need to produce and transport multiple film reels.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P12_S3	Further, digital projection allows the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the opera and special live documentaries.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P12_S4	Thirty-five films released wide during 2011 were available in 3-D format and at least 35 3-D films are currently expected to be released during 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images that immerse the patron into a film.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	A premium is generally charged for a 3-D presentation.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P13_S2	In addition, digital projection systems are a more eco-friendly technology since the hard drives require less materials to manufacture and can be used more than once, unlike 35 millimeter film reels.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry has a track record of long-term growth, with box office revenues growing at an estimated CAGR of 3.6% from 2000 to 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	Against this background of steady long-term growth, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance, and consequently box office revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P14_S2	While 2011 industry statistics have not yet been published, industry sources estimate that 2011 U.S. box office revenues were approximately $10.2 billion.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P14_S3	The following table represents the results of a survey by Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, published during February 2011, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2001 to 2010:
1385280_12_ITEM15_P15_S0	Part One, Paranormal Activity 3, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Sherlock Holmes:
1385280_12_ITEM15_P15_S1	A Game of Shadows, The Adventures of Tintin, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, War Horse and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked , among other films.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P15_S2	The film slate for 2012 currently includes sequels such as Men in Black 3, Madagascar 3: Europe s Most Wanted, Ice Age: Continental Drift, The Dark Knight Rises, The Bourne Legacy, Wrath of the Titans, and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 and original titles such as Dr. Suess The Lorax, The Hunger Games, The Avengers, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, World War Z, and Life of Pi, among other films.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	International Markets International box office revenue continues to grow.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $21.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is a result of strong economies, ticket price increases and new theatre construction.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing a 25% increase from 2009.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S3	Growth in Latin America is expected to continue to be fueled by a combination of robust economies, growing populations, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), substantial retail development, and quality product from Hollywood, including an increasing number of 3-D films.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S4	In many Latin American countries, particularly Mexico and Brazil, successful local film product can also provide incremental growth opportunities.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S5	We believe many international markets for theatrical exhibition have historically been underserved and that certain of these markets, especially those in Latin America, will continue to experience growth as additional modern stadium-styled theatres are introduced, film product offerings continue to expand and the local economies continue to grow, resulting in the expansion of the middle class.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P16_S6	Drivers of Continued Industry Success We believe the following market trends will drive the continued growth and strength of our industry: Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands and Subsequent Markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	Theatrical exhibition is the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	A successful theatrical release which brands a film is one of the major factors in determining its success in downstream markets, such as DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success .
1385280_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $21.2 billion, or approximately 67% of 2010 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P18_S2	With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will become even more significant.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P18_S3	Many of the top U.S. films released recently also performed exceptionally well in international markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P18_S4	Such films included Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 , which grossed approximately $947.1 million in international markets, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides , which grossed approximately $800.0 million in international markets and Transformers: Dark of the Moon , which grossed approximately $765.0 million in international markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	We believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the industry.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P19_S1	Even during the recent recessionary period, attendance levels remained stable as consumers selected the theatre as a preferred value for their discretionary income.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	With the motion picture exhibition industry s transition to digital projection technology, the products offered by motion picture exhibitors continue to expand, attracting a broader base of patrons.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $7.89 in 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P21_S2	Average prices in 2010 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, range from approximately $25.00 to $77.00 per ticket according to MPAA.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Our industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009, which has allowed exhibitors to expand their product offerings.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	Digital projection allows the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the opera and special live documentaries.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P22_S2	These additional programming alternatives may expand the industry s customer base and increase patronage for exhibitors.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: Disciplined Operating Philosophy.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	We generated operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. of $308.6 million and $130.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined operating philosophy that centers on building high quality assets, while negotiating favorable theatre level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P25_S1	Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P25_S2	We have a leading market share in the U.S. metropolitan and suburban markets we serve.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P25_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, we ranked either first or second based on box office revenues in 24 out of our top 30 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston and Salt Lake City.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Strategically Located in Heavily Populated Latin American Markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Since 1993, we have invested throughout Latin America in response to the continued growth of the region.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	We currently operate 159 theatres and 1,274 screens in 13 countries.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	Our international screens generated revenues of $696.1 million, or 30.5% of our total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S3	We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in the region, with theatres in twelve of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S5	With a geographically diverse circuit, we are an important distribution channel to the movie studios.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S6	Approximately 87% of our international screens offer stadium seating.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S7	We are well-positioned with our modern, large-format theatres to take advantage of these factors for further growth and diversification of our revenues.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S8	We offer state-of-the-art theatres, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S9	We feature stadium seating in approximately 87% of our first run auditoriums.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S10	During 2011, we increased the size of our circuit by adding 249 state-of-the-art screens worldwide.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S11	We currently have commitments to open 246 additional new screens over the next three years.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S12	We have installed digital projection technology in 100% of our first run U.S. auditoriums and plan to install digital projection technology in 100% of our international auditoriums.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S13	Approximately 48% of our U.S. screens are 3-D compatible and 37% of our international screens are 3-D compatible.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P27_S14	We also converted our six existing film-based IMAX screens to digital projection technology and installed two additional digital IMAX systems during 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Our new NextGen theatre concept provides further credence to our commitment to provide a continuing state-of-the-art movie-viewing experience to our patrons.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Solid Balance Sheet with Significant Cash Flow from Operating Activities.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	We generate significant cash flow from operating activities as a result of several factors, including a geographically diverse and modern theatre circuit and management s ability to control costs and effectively react to economic and market changes.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S3	Additionally, owning land and buildings for 41 of our theatres is a strategic advantage that enhances our cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S4	We believe our expected level of cash flow generation will provide us with the financial flexibility to continue to pursue growth opportunities, support our debt payments and continue to make dividend payments to our stockholders.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S5	In addition, as of December 31, 2011, we owned approximately 17.5 million shares of National CineMedia and approximately 1.2 million shares in RealD, both of which offer us an additional source of cash flows.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P28_S6	As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $521.4 million.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Warner, Chief Financial Officer Robert Copple and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our management team has many years of theatre operating experience, ranging from 15 to 53 years, executing a focused strategy that has led to consistent operating results.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	This management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	We believe our disciplined operating philosophy and experienced management team will enable us to continue to enhance our leading position in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	Key components of our strategy include: Establish and Maintain Leading Market Positions.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S4	We will continue to seek growth opportunities by building or acquiring modern theatres that meet our strategic, financial and demographic criteria.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S5	We focus on establishing and maintaining a leading position in the markets we currently serve.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S6	We also monitor economic and market trends to ensure we offer a broad range of products and prices that satisfy our patrons.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S7	Continue to Focus on Operational Excellence.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S8	We will continue to focus on achieving operational excellence by controlling theatre operating costs and adequately training our staff while continuing to provide leading customer service.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S9	Our margins reflect our track record of operating efficiency.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S10	Selectively Build in Profitable, Strategic Latin American Markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S11	Our continued international expansion will remain focused primarily on Latin America through construction of modern, state-of-the-art theatres in growing urban markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S12	We have commitments to build six new theatres with 43 screens during 2012 and three new theatres with 22 screens subsequent to 2012, investing an additional $72 million in our Latin American markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S13	We also plan to install digital projection technology in all of our international auditoriums, which allows us to present 3-D and alternative content in these markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S14	Approximately 37% of our international auditoriums are 3-D compatible.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S15	We have also installed 26 of our proprietary XD auditoriums in our international theatres and have plans to install approximately 15 additional XD auditoriums internationally during 2012.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S16	Our commitment to technological innovation has resulted in us having 3,530 digital auditoriums in the U.S. as of December 31, 2011, 1,844 of which are 3-D compatible.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S17	We also had 477 digital auditoriums in our international markets as of December 31, 2011, all of which are 3-D compatible.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S18	See further discussion of our digital expansion at Conversion to Digital Projection Technology .
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S19	We are planning to convert 100% of our worldwide circuit to digital projection technology, approximately 40-50% of which will be 3-D compatible.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P29_S20	We also plan to expand our XD auditorium footprint in various markets throughout the U.S. and in select international markets, which offers our patrons a premium movie-viewing experience.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Theatre Operations As of December 31, 2011, we operated 456 theatres and 5,152 screens in 39 states and 13 Latin American countries.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Our theatres in the U.S. are primarily located in mid-sized U.S. markets, including suburbs of major metropolitan areas.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	We believe these markets are generally less competitive and generate high, stable margins.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	Our theatres in Latin America are primarily located in major metropolitan markets, which we believe are generally underscreened.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	The following tables summarize the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	(1) Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	We first entered Latin America when we began operating movie theatres in Chile in 1993 and Mexico in 1994.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Since then, through our focused international strategy, we have developed into the most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the region.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, currently operating theatres in twelve of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in Latin America.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S3	In addition, we have achieved significant scale in Brazil, where we are the largest exhibitor, and Mexico, the two largest Latin American economies, with 434 screens in Brazil and 294 screens in Mexico as of December 31, 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S4	We are also the largest exhibitor in Argentina and Chile.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S5	We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in Latin American markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S6	We will continue to build and expand our presence in underserved international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S7	We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by using local currencies to collect a majority of our revenues and fund a majority of the costs of our international operations.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S8	Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P33_S9	Our international revenues were approximately $696.1 million during 2011 compared to $564.2 million during 2010.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	In the domestic marketplace, the Company s film department negotiates with film distributors, which are made up of the traditional major film companies, specialized and art divisions of some of these major film companies, and many other independent film distributors.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates, the related marketing campaigns and the expenditures related to marketing materials, television spots and other advertising outlets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	The marketing campaign of each movie may include tours of the actors in the movies and coordination of articles and features about each movie.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company is responsible for booking the films in negotiated film zones, which are either free zones or competitive zones.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	In free zones, movies can be booked without regard to the location of another exhibitor within that area.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	In competitive zones, the distributor allocates their movies to the exhibitors located in that area generally based on demographics and grossing potential of that particular area.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	We are the sole exhibitor in approximately 91% of the 229 film zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P35_S4	In film zones where there is no direct competition from other theatres, we select those films that we believe will be the most successful from those offered to us by film distributors.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P35_S5	Internationally, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	In the international marketplace, films are not allocated to a single theatre in a geographic film zone, but played by competitive theatres simultaneously.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a modern facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable stadium style seating and other amenities typical of modern American-style multiplexes, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	Of the 1,274 screens we operate in international markets, approximately 79% have no direct competition from other theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Our film rental fees in the U.S. are generally based on a film s box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms, a sliding scale formula, or a mutually agreed upon settlement, subject to the film licensing agreement.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P38_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Internationally, our film rental fees are primarily based on mutually agreed upon firm terms that are based upon a specified percentage of box office receipts.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	We regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres, providing a variety of film choices to our patrons.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	Bringing art and independent films to our theatres allows us to benefit from the growth in the art and independent market driven by the more mature patron and increased interest in art, foreign and documentary films.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P40_S3	High profile film festivals, such as the Sundance Film Festival, have contributed to interest in this genre.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P40_S4	The performance of films such as Midnight in Paris, The Descendants, and The Iron Lady have demonstrated the box office potential of art and independent films.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	Food, Beverages and Amusements Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 30% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P42_S1	We have devoted considerable management effort to increase concession sales and improve operating margins.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P42_S2	These efforts include implementation of the following strategies:
1385280_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	We offer concession products that primarily include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juices, candy and quickly-prepared food, such as hot dogs, nachos and ice cream.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	Different varieties and flavors of candy and drinks are offered at theatres based on preferences in that particular market.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	Our point of sale system allows us to monitor product sales and make changes to product mix when necessary, which also allows us to quickly take advantage of national as well as regional product launches.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	Specially priced combos and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase average concession purchases as well as to attract new buyers.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	We periodically offer our loyal patrons opportunities to receive a discount on certain products by offering reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discount off the regular price.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	Consumer promotions conducted at the concession stand usually include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving more customers more quickly.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	We have self-service concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P45_S3	This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices and superior visibility of concession items.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P45_S4	Concession designs in many of our new domestic theatres have incorporated the self-service model.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Concession supplies are distributed through a national distribution network.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	place orders directly with the vendors to replenish stock.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P48_S1	We conduct a weekly inventory of all concession products at each theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained for business.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	Pre-Feature Screen Advertising In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	NCM s primary activities that impact our theatres include: advertising through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program, lobby promotions and displays; live and pre-recorded networked and single-site meetings and events; and live and pre-recorded concerts, sporting events and other non-film entertainment programming.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S4	In addition, we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S5	As of December 31, 2011, we had an approximate 16% ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P49_S6	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	In certain of our international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens, while at our other locations, our in-house marketing personnel handle screen advertising.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P50_S3	We recently took the screen advertising function in-house in Brazil, which is being handled by a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P50_S4	Our Flix Media marketing personnel work directly with local advertisers to generate screen advertising.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Participation in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners During 2007, we, AMC Entertainment Inc., or AMC, and Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, entered into a joint venture known as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners LLC, or DCIP, to facilitate the implementation of digital cinema in our U.S. theatres and to establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the financing of digital cinema.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Digital cinema developments are managed by DCIP, subject to certain approvals by us, AMC and Regal with each of us having an equal voting interest in DCIP.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	DCIP s wholly-owned subsidiary Kasima executed long-term deployment agreements with all of the major motion picture studios, under which Kasima receives a virtual print fee from such studios for each digital presentation.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P52_S3	In accordance with these agreements, the digital projection systems deployed by Kasima comply with the technology and security specifications developed by the Digital Cinema Initiatives studio consortium.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	Kasima leases digital projection systems to us, AMC and Regal under master lease agreements that have an initial term of 12 years.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	On March 10, 2010, we signed a master lease agreement and other related agreements (collectively the agreements ) with Kasima.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Upon signing these agreements, we contributed cash and the majority of our existing U.S. digital projection systems to DCIP.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	Subsequently during 2010 and 2011, we sold additional U.S. digital projection systems to DCIP.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P53_S4	As of December 31, 2011, we had a 33% voting interest in DCIP and a 24.3% economic interest in DCIP.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had 3,530 digital auditoriums in the U.S., 3,460 of which are leased from Kasima and 1,844 of which are capable of exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	International Markets In our international markets, we continue to convert our auditoriums to digital projection technology.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had 477 digital auditoriums in our international markets, all of which are capable of exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	Similar to our domestic markets, we expect to install digital projection systems in all of our international auditoriums.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	Marketing In the U.S., we rely on Internet advertising and also newspaper directory film schedules.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Radio and television advertising spots are used to promote certain motion pictures and special events.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	We exhibit previews of coming attractions and films we are currently playing as part of our pre-feature program.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	We offer patrons access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets at home and purchase gift cards at our Web site www.cinemark.com .
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S3	Customers subscribing to our weekly email receive targeted information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about advanced tickets, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and exclusive coupons for concession savings.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S4	We partner with film distributors to use monthly web contests to drive traffic to our Web site and to ensure that customers visit often.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S5	In addition, we work with all of the film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films with local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S6	These programs may involve customer contests, cross-promotions with the media and third parties and other means to increase patronage for a particular film showing at one of our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P56_S7	We also have an iPhone application in the U.S. that allows patrons to find theatres, check showtimes and purchase tickets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Internationally, we exhibit upcoming and current film previews on screen, we partner with film distributors for certain promotions and advertise our new locations through various forms of media and events.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	We partner with large multi-national corporations in the large metropolitan areas in which we have theatres to promote our brand, our image and to increase attendance levels at our theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	Our customers are encouraged to register on our Web site to receive weekly information by email for showtime information, invitations to special screenings, sponsored events and promotional information.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	In addition, our customers can request to receive showtime information on their cell phones.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S4	We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S5	In addition, the Company has introduced an iPhone application in Brazil.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S6	The application allows consumers to check showtimes and purchase tickets for our Brazil theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S7	Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on maximizing ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P57_S8	We market these programs to such business representatives as realtors, human resource managers, incentive program managers and hospital and pharmaceutical personnel.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	Gift cards can be purchased for certain of our locations at our theatres or online through our Web site, www.cinemark.com .
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	Our patrons may purchase advance tickets for all of our domestic screens and a majority of our international screens by accessing our corporate Web site at www.cinemark.com.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	Advance tickets may also be purchased for our domestic screens at www.fandango.com.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S3	Our mobile phone and tablet applications offer patrons the ability to purchase tickets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S4	Our Internet initiatives help improve customer satisfaction, allowing patrons who purchase tickets over the Internet to bypass lines at the box office by printing their tickets at home, picking up their tickets at kiosks located at the theatre, or scanning a barcode confirmation from their mobile device at the usher stand.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S5	We have developed our own proprietary point of sale system to enhance our ability to maximize revenues, control costs and efficiently manage operations.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P58_S6	The system is currently installed in all of our U.S. theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	reports to allow for timely changes to movie schedules, including extending film runs, increasing the number of screens on which successful movies are being played, or substituting films when gross receipts do not meet expectations.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	Real-time seating, as well as reserved seating, and box office information is available to box office personnel, preventing overselling of a particular film and providing faster and more accurate responses to customer inquiries regarding showtimes and available seating.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	The system tracks concession sales by product, provides in-theatre inventory reports for efficient inventory management and control, offers numerous ticket pricing options, connects with digital concession signage for real-time pricing modifications, integrates Internet ticket sales and processes credit card transactions.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	Barcode scanners, pole displays, touch screens, credit card readers and other equipment are integrated with the system to enhance its functions and provide print-at-home and mobile ticketing.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P59_S4	In our international locations, we currently use other point of sale systems that have been developed by third parties, which have been certified as compliant with applicable governmental regulations and provide generally the same capabilities as our proprietary point of sale system.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry in terms of both attendance and the number of screens in operation.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting patrons, licensing films and developing new theatre sites.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	Our domestic competitors include Regal, AMC and Carmike Cinemas, Inc. and our international competitors, which vary by country, include Cin polis, Cinemex and National Amusements.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	We are the sole exhibitor in approximately 91% of the 229 film zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P60_S4	In film zones where there is no direct competition from other theatres, we select those films that we believe will be the most successful from those offered to us by film distributors.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P60_S5	Where there is competition, the distributor allocates their movies to the exhibitors located in that area generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Of the 1,274 screens we operate outside of the U.S., approximately 79% of those screens have no direct competition from other theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	In areas where we face direct competition, our success in attracting patrons depends on location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P61_S2	We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues, with securing a potential site being dependent upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue and patron potential, and financial stability.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P61_S3	We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P61_S4	We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Our corporate headquarters is located in Plano, Texas.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P62_S1	Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight for our domestic and international theatres.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P62_S2	Domestic personnel at our corporate headquarters include our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, concessions, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance and accounting, audit and information systems support.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Our U.S. operations are divided into sixteen regions, primarily organized geographically, each of which is headed by a region leader.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	legal, audit, accounting and information systems.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	We have eight regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in thirteen individual countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are operated out of one Central American regional office).
1385280_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	Each regional office is headed by a general manager and includes personnel in film licensing, marketing, human resources, information systems, operations and accounting.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	We have a chief financial officer in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, which are our three largest international markets.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P65_S3	The regional offices are staffed with experienced personnel from the region to mitigate cultural and operational barriers.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	Employees We have approximately 14,000 employees in the U.S., approximately 10% of whom are full time employees and 90% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	We have approximately 8,000 employees in our international markets, approximately 51% of whom are full time employees and approximately 49% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P66_S3	We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors is subject to consent decrees resulting from these cases.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including us, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S2	We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S3	We develop new theatres to be accessible to the disabled and we believe we are substantially compliant with current regulations relating to accommodating the disabled.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S4	Although we believe that our theatres comply with the ADA, we have been a party to lawsuits which claim that our handicapped seating arrangements do not comply with the ADA or that we are required to provide captioning for patrons who are deaf or are severely hearing impaired.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S5	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and licensing.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S6	We currently have operations in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala, which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_12_ITEM15_P68_S7	See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with seven major film distributors accounting for approximately 85% of U.S. box office revenues and 47 of the top 50 grossing films during 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from these antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The consent decrees bind certain major film distributors to license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The motion picture industry is highly competitive.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	An increase in the use of alternative or downstream film distribution channels and other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels or competing forms of entertainment could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video release windows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Over the last decade, the average video release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, an important downstream market, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Film studios have started to offer consumers a premium video on-demand option for certain films 60 days following the theatrical release, which caused the release window to shrink further for certain films.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We cannot assure you that these release windows, which are determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S7	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S9	We have 167 theatres with 1,324 screens in thirteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Brazil represented approximately 13.3% of our consolidated 2012 revenues.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and transfers abroad, all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our international operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	As of December 31, 2012, we had $1,764.0 million in long-term debt obligations, $150.2 million in capital lease obligations and $1,889.2 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We incurred interest expense of $123.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S8	We incurred $281.6 million of facility lease expense under operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the terms under these operating leases, excluding optional renewal periods, range from one to 25 years).
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk to you by:
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or that future borrowings will be available under our amended senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our amended senior secured credit facility.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our amended senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in the loss of your investment.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In 2005, we joined Regal and AMC as founding members of NCM, a provider of digital advertising content and digital non-film event content.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 16%.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, the Company received approximately $5.9 million and $7.1 million in other revenues from NCM, respectively, and $24.2 million and $20.8 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	NCM also competes with other cinema advertising companies and with hotels, conference centers, arenas, restaurants and convention facilities for its non-film related events to be shown or held in our auditoriums.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are subject to uncertainties related to digital cinema, including insufficient financing to obtain digital projectors and insufficient supply of digital projectors for our international locations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We began a roll-out of digital projection equipment in our international theatres during 2009 which has been funded by operating cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	projectors for our international theatres on commercially reasonable terms.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, the cost of digital projection systems and manufacturer limitations may delay our international deployment.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	While we continue to convert our theatres to digital projection technology, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We cannot assure you that our expansion strategy will result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing or that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we do not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	On November 15, 2004, we and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	We depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S7	The loss or unavailability of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly impair our business.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We assess many factors when determining whether to impair individual theatre assets, including actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the theatre assets, the theatre assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Since we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We have a significant amount of goodwill.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using a two-step approach under which we compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step would be performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Fair values are determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2010 and seven and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011 and 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could negatively affect our estimated fair values and could result in further impairments of goodwill.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the estimated fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We also have a significant amount of tradename intangible assets.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We recorded asset impairment charges of $12.5 million, $7.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We cannot assure you that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future, and such charges may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The impairment or insolvency of certain financial institutions could adversely affect us.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We have exposure to different counterparties with regard to our interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties to such agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We also have exposure to financial institutions used as depositories of our corporate cash balances.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If our counterparties or financial institutions become impaired or insolvent, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or impair our ability to access our cash.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P33_S6	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the United States and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our amended senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long term debt agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to you.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Certain provisions of our 8.625% senior notes indenture, our 5.125% senior notes indenture, our 7.375% senior subordinated notes indenture and our amended senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of our 8.625% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of our 5.125% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	A change of control , as defined in the senior subordinated notes indenture, would require us to make an offer to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	A change of control would also be an event of default under our amended senior secured credit facility.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common Stock will continue.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and the market prices of the securities of companies have been particularly volatile.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	This market volatility, as well as general economic or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating performance.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors and, in response, the market price of our Common Stock may decrease significantly and prevent investors from reselling their shares of our Common Stock at or above a market price that is favorable to other stockholders.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs, liabilities and a diversion of management s attention and resources.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	As of December 31, 2012, we had an aggregate of 173,074,817 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S7	We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S8	As of December 31, 2012, we had 114,949,667 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.

1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S10	The remaining shares of our Common Stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P41_S11	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.

1385280_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The sale of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options could further dilute your investment in our Common Stock and adversely affect our stock price.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the United States to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_13_ITEM1A_P44_S5	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.

1385280_13_ITEM1B_P1_S1	We also lease office space in Frisco, Texas for our theatre support group.
1385280_13_ITEM1B_P2_S0	International As of December 31, 2012, internationally, we operated 167 theatres with 1,324 screens, all of which are leased.
1385280_13_ITEM1B_P2_S1	Our international leases are generally entered into on a long term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years.

1385280_13_ITEM4_P7_S0	(1) For the purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes plus fixed charges excluding capitalized interest.
1385280_13_ITEM4_P7_S1	Fixed charges consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of debt issue costs and that portion of rental expense which we believe to be representative of the interest factor.
1385280_13_ITEM4_P7_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2008, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $27.1 million.
1385280_13_ITEM4_P8_S0	(2) The data excludes certain theatres operated by us in the U.S. pursuant to management agreements that are not part of our consolidated operations.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Revenues and Expenses We generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our contracts with NCM have assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising, third party branding, and the use of our domestic theatres for alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the opera and other special presentations.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2012 included The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, The Hunger Games, Skyfall, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Dr. Suess The Lorax, Madagascar 3:
1385280_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Europe s Most Wanted, Men in Black 3, Taken 2, Snow White and the Huntsman, Safe House, The Vow, Brave, Prometheus , The Amazing Spider-Man, Ice Age: Continental Drift and The Bourne Legacy, among other films.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our revenues are affected by changes in attendance and concession revenues per patron.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Attendance is primarily affected by the quality and quantity of films released by motion picture studios.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Films currently scheduled for release in 2013 include sequels such as The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Iron Man 3, The Hangover 3, Monsters University, Despicable Me 2, Fast Furious 6 and A Good Day to Die Hard and original titles such as Man of Steel, Oz: The Great and Powerful, Oblivion, Pacific Rim, Lone Ranger and World War Z, among other films.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	Film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	The monthly cost of these advertisements is based on, among other things, the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Utilities and other costs include certain costs that have both fixed and variable components such as utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P10_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S5	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S6	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S7	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S8	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P14_S9	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of our sixteen regions in the U.S. and each of our eight international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The evaluation is a two-step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2010 and seven and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011 and 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the estimated fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by at least 10%.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc. , a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P38_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment).
1385280_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income (loss) of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	Recent Developments Dividend Declaration On February 12, 2013, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2012 of $0.21 per common share payable to stockholders of record on March 4, 2013.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	The increase was primarily due to increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt related to the amendment and extension of our former senior secured credit facility in March 2010 and the refinancing in June 2011 of the unextended portion of our term loan debt outstanding with 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	The loss included the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issue costs related to the portion of the term loan debt that was prepaid and the reclassification of $2.7 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings as a result of our determination that quarterly interest payments hedged by certain of our interest rate swap agreements are no longer probable to occur.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P63_S4	We recorded distributions received from NCM of $24.2 million during 2011 and $23.4 million during 2010, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P63_S7	The loss recorded represented the cumulative net unrealized holding losses we had previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P63_S8	These cumulative net unrealized holding losses were recognized as a loss during 2011 due to the length of time and extent to which RealD s stock price had been below our basis in the stock.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	In addition, a majority of our theatres provide the patron a choice of using a credit card or debit card in place of cash.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Because our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating float and historically have not required traditional working capital financing.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	On March 2, 2010, the Company completed an amendment and extension to this former senior secured credit facility to primarily extend the maturities of the facility and make certain other modifications.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	The then remaining term loan debt of $159.2 million that was not extended continued to have a maturity date of October 2013.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	On June 3, 2011, Cinemark USA, Inc. prepaid the remaining $157.2 million of its unextended term loan debt utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Cinemark USA, Inc. 7.375% senior subordinated notes discussed above.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	There were no prepayment penalties incurred upon the prepayment of the term loan debt.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	Subsequent to the prepayment, the quarterly payments due on the term loan were approximately $2.3 million per quarter through March 2016 with the remaining principal amount of approximately $866.6 million due April 30, 2016.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	The prepayment did not impact the interest rate applicable to the remaining portion of the term loan debt, which accrued interest at Cinemark USA, Inc. s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Telerate page 5, or (2) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.50%, plus a 2.25% margin per annum, or (B) a eurodollar rate plus a 3.25% margin per annum.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S4	The prepayment did not impact the interest rate applicable to or the maturity of Cinemark USA, Inc. s revolving credit line.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S5	The maturity date of $73.5 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s $150.0 million revolving credit line had been extended from October 2012 to March 2015.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P99_S6	The maturity date of the remaining $76.5 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s revolving credit line did not change and remained October 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	The interest rate on the original revolving credit line accrued interest, at Cinemark USA, Inc. s option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Telerate page 5 and (2) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.50%, plus a margin that ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, or (B) a eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranged from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The interest rate on the extended revolving credit line accrued interest, at Cinemark USA, Inc. s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Telerate page 5, or (2) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.50%, plus a margin that ranges from 1.75% to 2.0% per annum, or (B) a eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranged from 2.75% to 3.0% per annum.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	The margin of the revolving credit line was determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Former Senior Secured Credit Facility.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	As a result of the prepayment made in June 2011, we wrote-off approximately $2.2 million in unamortized debt issue costs related to the unextended portion of term loan debt that was prepaid.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	In addition, we determined that a portion of the quarterly interest payments hedged by two of our then current interest rate swap agreements under cash flow hedges and the quarterly interest payments related to our previously terminated interest rate swap agreement were probable not to occur and therefore reclassified approximately $2.7 million of our accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these cash flow hedges to earnings, as a component of loss on early retirement of debt.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	These write-offs, combined with related fees, are reflected in loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	On December 18, 2012, the remaining outstanding term loan of $899.0 million was paid in full with proceeds from the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility combined with a portion of the proceeds from the 5.125% Senior Notes issuance, both of which are discussed above.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Ratings We are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency s evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Below are our latest credit ratings, which were published by the respective agency during December 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	B With respect to the ratings issued by Moody s as noted above, Moody s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Ba1 Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	B2 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	B3 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Prime-3 portion of the rating indicates issuer has an acceptable ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor s as noted above, Standard and Poor s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	B More vulnerable to adverse business, financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	BB+ Considered highest speculative grade by market participants.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	BB- Less vulnerable in the near-term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business, financial and economic conditions.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, an amendment to FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASU 2012-02 ).
1385280_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The update provides an entity with the option first to assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	After assessing the qualitative factors, if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, the entity is not required to take further action.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	If an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2012-02 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to mid-August, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P117_S3	The timing of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	We have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P118_S2	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P118_S3	At December 31, 2012, there was an aggregate of approximately $250.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities, which excludes $450.0 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s term loan debt that is hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements as discussed below.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2012, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.5 million.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	All of our current interest rate swap agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P119_S2	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P119_S3	Below is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2012:
1385280_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2012:
1385280_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	(1) Includes $450.0 million of the Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan, which represents the debt currently hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and construction interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, require that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P124_S3	Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $51 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 by approximately $8 million, $9 million and $9 million, respectively.

1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P133_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P134_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P134_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P134_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_13_ITEM7_P134_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P5_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P6_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) is a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States ( U.S. ), Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	The Company also managed additional theatres in the U.S., Brazil, and Colombia during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P13_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P13_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P13_S4	Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating funds held in financial institutions, petty cash held by the theatres and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	Cash investments were primarily in money market funds or other similar funds.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which are recorded at net realizable value, consists primarily of receivables related to screen advertising, receivables related to discounted tickets sold to retail locations, rebates earned from the Company s beverage and other concession vendors and value-added and other tax receivables.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	Inventories Concession and theatre supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	Theatre Properties and Equipment Theatre properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Lesser of lease term or useful life The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and for fee owned properties, the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P22_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of theatre businesses acquired.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P23_S2	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P23_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its sixteen regions in the U.S. and each of its eight international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P25_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2010 and seven and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011 and 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the Company s tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from 1 to 10 years.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from 1 to 24 years.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement or the expected useful life of the intangible asset.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	The remaining useful lives of these intangible assets range from 1 to 8 years.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of debt issue costs, long-term prepaid rents, construction related deposits, lease deposits, equipment to be placed in service, and other assets of a long-term nature.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Debt issue costs are amortized using the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over the primary financing terms of the related debt agreement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Long-term prepaid rents represent prepayments of rent on operating leases.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	These payments are recognized as facility lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	The amortization periods generally range from 1 to 10 years.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	If substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership have been transferred to the lessee, the Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P39_S2	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P39_S3	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P39_S4	At the end of the construction period, the Company determines if the transaction qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment in regards to lease classification.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P39_S5	If the Company receives a lease incentive payment from a landlord, the Company records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the initial term of the respective lease.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	Revenues related to these advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company is self-insured for general liability claims subject to an annual cap.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, claims were capped at $250 per occurrence with an annual cap of approximately $2,650.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P41_S2	The Company is also self-insured for medical claims up to $125 per occurrence.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, the Company s insurance reserves were $7,600 and $7,693, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	The Company records proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P43_S4	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P43_S5	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, the Company s liabilities for advanced sale-type certificates were approximately $41,611 and $46,063, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $7,073, $7,846 and $9,093 during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a mutually agreed upon specified percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P47_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using either an option-pricing model, consistent with the terms of the award, or a market observed price, if such a price exists.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	The Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P48_S4	See Note 19 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company has interest rate swap agreements and investments in marketable securities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	With respect to its interest rate swap agreements, the Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S2	Therefore, the Company s fair value measurements for its interest rate swaps use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S3	With respect to its investments in marketable securities, the Company uses quoted market prices, which fall under Level 1 of the hierarchy.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S4	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S5	See Note 14 for further discussion of the Company s interest rate swap agreements and Note 15 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S6	The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis, primarily in the impairment evaluations for goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P62_S7	See Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Theatre Properties and Equipment included above for discussion of such fair value measurements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts realized.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company provides assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P64_S3	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P64_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P64_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methodologies utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, an amendment to FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ( ASU 2012-02 ).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	The update provides an entity with the option first to assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	After assessing the qualitative factors, if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, the entity is not required to take further action.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	If an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2012-02 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company considers its unvested share based payment awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities, and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	Basic earnings per share for the two classes of stock (common stock and unvested restricted stock) is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock plus the potentially dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding determined under both the two class method and the treasury stock method.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	The estimated purchase price is approximately $240,000.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	The purchase price, the amount of which is subject to certain closing date adjustments, will consist of cash consideration and the assumption of certain liabilities.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P72_S3	The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2013, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for transactions of this type, including Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission antitrust approval.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Acquisition of Argentina Theatres During August 2011, the Company acquired ten theatres with 95 screens from Hoyts General Cinema South America, Inc. in a stock purchase for approximately $66,958 in cash.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	The acquisition resulted in an expansion of the Company s international theatre base.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	The Company incurred approximately $200 in transaction costs, which are reflected in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	The transaction was accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P73_S4	The following table represents the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	The weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets acquired was approximately seven years as of the acquisition date.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	The acquisition is subject to review by the Argentina Comisi n Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia ( CNDC ).

1385280_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data During November 2010, the Company also sold its interest in a profit sharing agreement related to a previously sold Canadian property.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company received proceeds of approximately $8,493 and recorded a gain on sale of assets and other.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	LLC The Company has an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCMI ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior ESA, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S4	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S5	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron, initially seven cents, and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for certain reasons outlined in the modified ESA.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S6	The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the first such increase taking effect after the end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P78_S7	For 2010, 2011 and 2012, the annual payment per digital screen was nine hundred twenty-six dollars, nine hundred seventy-two dollars and one thousand twenty-one dollars, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P79_S2	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 24 years.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	Following the NCM, Inc. IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P80_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P80_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, we follow the guidance in FASB ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S1	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S2	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S3	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S4	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S5	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P82_S6	Our Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income (loss) of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	If the Company then elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Tranche 2 Investment at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	During March 2010, NCM performed its annual common unit adjustment calculation under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	As a result of the calculation, the Company received an additional 1,757,548 common units of NCM, each of which is convertible into one share of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P84_S2	The Company recorded the additional common units received at fair value as part of its Tranche 2 Investment with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue of $30,683.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Subsequent to the annual common unit adjustment discussed above, in May 2010, one of NCM s other founding members completed an acquisition of another theatre circuit that required an extraordinary common unit adjustment calculation by NCM in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	As a result of this extraordinary common unit adjustment, the founding member was granted additional common units of NCM, which resulted in dilution of the Company s ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P85_S2	The Company recognized a change of interest gain of approximately $271 during the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of this extraordinary common unit adjustment, which is reflected in (gain) loss on sale of assets and other on the consolidated statement of income.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	During March 2011, NCM performed its annual common unit adjustment calculation under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	As a result of the calculation, the Company received an additional 549,417 common units of NCM, each of which is convertible into one share of NCM, Inc. common stock.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P134_S6	Subsequent to the prepayment, the quarterly payments due on the term loan were approximately $2,311 per quarter through March 2016 with the remaining principal amount of approximately $866,602 due April 30, 2016.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P134_S8	The prepayment did not impact the interest rate applicable to or the maturity of the Company s revolving credit line.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P135_S1	The maturity date of the remaining $76,500 of Cinemark USA, Inc. s revolving credit line did not change and remained October 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P136_S0	The interest rate on the original revolving credit line accrued interest, at Cinemark USA, Inc. s option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Telerate page 5 and (2) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.50%, plus a margin that ranges from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, or (B) a eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranged from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P136_S1	The interest rate on the extended revolving credit line accrued interest, at Cinemark USA, Inc. s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the higher of (1) the prime lending rate as set forth on the British Banking Association Telerate page 5, or (2) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.50%, plus a margin that ranges from 1.75% to 2.0% per annum, or (B) a eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranged from 2.75% to 3.0% per annum.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P136_S2	The margin of the revolving credit line was determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Former Senior Secured Credit Facility.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P137_S0	As a result of the prepayment made in June 2011, the Company wrote-off approximately $2,183 in unamortized debt issue costs related to the unextended portion of term loan debt that was prepaid.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P137_S1	In addition, the Company determined that a portion of the quarterly interest payments hedged by two of its current interest rate swap agreements under cash flow hedges and the quarterly interest payments related to its previously terminated interest rate swap agreement were probable not to occur and therefore reclassified approximately $2,760 of its accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these cash flow hedges to earnings, as a component of loss on early retirement of debt.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P137_S2	These write-offs, combined with related fees, are reflected in loss on early retirement of debt for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P137_S3	On December 18, 2012, the remaining outstanding term loan of $898,955 was paid in full with proceeds from the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility combined with a portion of the proceeds from the 5.125% Senior Notes issuance, both of which are discussed above.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Fair Value of Long Term Debt The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt primarily using quoted market prices, which fall under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P138_S1	The carrying value of the Company s long term debt was $1,764,010 and $1,572,221 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P138_S2	The fair value of the Company s long term debt was $1,851,246 and $1,622,286 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P138_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the Company believes it was in full compliance with all agreements, including related covenants, governing its outstanding debt.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P138_S4	The Company s long-term debt at December 31, 2012 matures as follows:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	(1) Reflects the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the 8.625% senior notes before the original issue discount of $8,536.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS The Company is currently a party to three interest rate swap agreements that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P140_S1	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into any of its interest rate swap agreements because the pay rates and receive rates on the interest rate swap agreements represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time each of the interest rate swap agreements was consummated.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	The changes in fair values are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P141_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Company reclassified $11,771, $15,929 and $12,979, respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	The valuation technique used to determine fair value is the income approach and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	Therefore, the Company s measurements use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	Below is a summary of the Company s interest rate swap agreements, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges, as of December 31, 2012:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	(1) Included in accrued other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	(2) Included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	The Company was previously a party to an interest rate swap agreement that was effective during 2007 with a counterparty that filed for bankruptcy during September 2008 and whose credit rating was downgraded as a result.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S1	Prior to the counterparty s credit rating downgrade, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S2	Subsequent to the counterparty s credit rating downgrade, the change in fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded in earnings as a component of interest expense.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S3	The Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement during October 2008.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S4	The Company determined that the forecasted transactions hedged by this interest rate swap are still probable to occur, thus the total amount previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this interest rate swap agreement of $18,147 was amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the period during which the forecasted transactions were expected to occur, which was September 15, 2008 through August 13, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S5	The Company amortized approximately $4,633, $4,236 and $2,470 to interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P146_S6	See Note 15 for additional information about the Company s fair value measurements related to its interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines fair value measurements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, which establishes a fair value hierarchy under which an asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value measurement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	The levels of input defined by FASB ASC Topic 820 are as follows:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	unobservable and should be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P148_S1	Below is a summary of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company under FASB ASC Topic 820 as of December 31, 2012: Below is a summary of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company under FASB ASC Topic 820 as of December 31, 2011: Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis in the impairment evaluations of its long-lived assets (see Note 1 and Note 11 for further discussions).
1385280_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P149_S1	The fair value measurement for the Company s investment in RealD transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P149_S2	Previous fair value estimates for the investment were based on RealD s quoted stock price, discounted to reflect the impact of a lock-up period to which the Company was subject.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	estimates for the investment subsequent to January 2011 were based on RealD s stock price with no adjustments.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P150_S1	See Note 8 for more information on the Company s investment in RealD.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2012.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	The accumulated other comprehensive loss account in stockholders equity of $23,682 and $37,698 at December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively, includes the cumulative foreign currency losses of $11,325 and $31,330, respectively, from translating the financial statements of the Company s international subsidiaries, the change in fair values of the Company s interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges and the change in fair value of the Company s available-for-sale securities.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	All foreign countries where the Company has operations are non-highly inflationary and the local currency is the same as the functional currency in all of the locations.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P153_S1	Thus, any fluctuation in the currency results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P153_S2	Below is a summary of the impact of translating the December 31, 2012 financial statements of certain of the Company s international subsidiaries: Below is a summary of the impact of translating the December 31, 2011 financial statements of certain of the Company s international subsidiaries:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data During May 2011, the Company s ownership in its Chilean subsidiary increased from 97.4% to 100% as a result of the Company s purchase of the noncontrolling interests shares of Cinemark Chile.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P154_S1	As part of this transaction, the Company recorded the amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss previously allocated to the noncontrolling interest of $485, related to the translation of the Chilean financial statements into U.S. dollars, as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss with an offsetting decrease to additional paid-in-capital.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	Below is a summary of the impact of changes in the Company s ownership interest in its subsidiaries on its equity:
1385280_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Common Stock Common stockholders are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P158_S1	Subject to the rights of holders of any then outstanding shares of the Company s preferred stock, the Company s common stockholders are entitled to any dividends that may be declared by the board of directors.

1385280_13_ITEM15_P158_S3	The Company has no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P158_S4	The Company s ability to pay dividends is effectively limited by its status as a holding company and the terms of its indentures and its subsidiary s amended senior secured credit facility, which also significantly restricts the ability of certain of the Company s subsidiaries to pay dividends directly or indirectly to the Company.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P158_S5	Furthermore, certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries currently have a deficit in retained earnings which prevents the Company from declaring and paying dividends from those subsidiaries.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	During April 2010, the Company s partners in Colombia (the Colombian Partners ) exercised an option available to them under an Exchange Option Agreement dated April 9, 2007 between the Company and the Colombian Partners.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P159_S1	Under this option, which was contingent upon completion of an initial public offering of common stock by the Company, the Colombian Partners were entitled to exchange their shares in Cinemark Colombia S.A. for shares of the Company s common stock.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P159_S2	The number of shares to be exchanged was determined based on the Company s equity value and the equity value of the Colombian Partners interest in Cinemark Colombia S.A., both of which are defined in the Exchange Option Agreement.
1385280_13_ITEM15_P159_S3	As a result of this exchange, on June 14, 2010, the Company issued 1,112,723 shares of its common stock to the Colombian Partners.

1385280_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we operated 482 theatres and 5,563 screens in the U.S. and Latin America and approximately 276.6 million patrons attended our theatres worldwide during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	We are the most geographically diverse worldwide exhibitor, with theatres in thirteen countries as of December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2013, our U.S. circuit had 334 theatres and 4,457 screens in 40 states and our Latin America circuit had 148 theatres and 1,106 screens.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P2_S4	Revenues, operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2013, were $2,682.9 million, $415.5 million and $148.5 million, respectively.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P2_S5	At December 31, 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of $599.9 million and long-term debt of $1,832.8 million.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P2_S6	Approximately $243.0 million, or 13%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and approximately $9.9 million of our long-term debt matures in 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	During May 2013, we acquired a total of 32 theatres with 483 screens from Rave Real Property Holdco, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	As a result of this acquisition, we expanded our domestic theatre base into one new state and seven new markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	We continue to develop new platforms and market adaptive concepts for our domestic theatre circuit, including NextGen, Cin Arts, Cinemark Movie Bistro, VIP and other premium concepts.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S4	We believe our portfolio of modern high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid cash flows from operating activities.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S5	Our significant presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly as they look to capitalize on the expanding worldwide box office.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P3_S6	Our market leadership is attributable in large part to our senior executives, whose years of industry experience range from 17 to 55 years and who have successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Currently, 100% of our first-run domestic theatres are fully digital and we continue to convert our international theatres, which are approximately 86% digital.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	We expect to be 100% digital in our international circuit in early 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Digital projection technology provides us flexibility in programming and facilitates the exhibition of live and pre-recorded alternative entertainment.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	We also continue to roll out our Cinemark XD Extreme Digital Cinema, or XD.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We have the largest premium large format, or PLF, footprint in our industry.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	Our XD offers a premium experience utilizing large screens and the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including Dolby Atmos 11.1 and Barco Auro 20.1.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	The XD experience includes wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S5	We charge a premium price for the XD experience.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S6	The exceptional XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in the XD auditorium without any print enhancements required.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S7	As of December 31, 2013, we had 150 XD auditoriums in our circuit with plans to install 45 to 55 more XD auditoriums during 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S8	Our NextGen concept features wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens and the latest digital projection and sound technologies in all of the auditoriums of a complex.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S9	These theatres generally also have an XD auditorium.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S10	Most of our future domestic theatres will incorporate this NextGen concept.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S11	As of December 31, 2013, 193 screens within 17 theatres have the NextGen concept.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S12	During 2013, we opened our first Cinemark Movie Bistro locations, which offer in-theatre dining with great tasting food options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S13	During 2014 we will introduce premium concept theatres in the U.S. that will offer luxury amenities, and a wide variety of food and beverage products.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S14	We have a similar concept in twenty-nine of our international auditoriums, referred to locally as either Cinemark Premiere or Cinemark Prime.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P5_S15	We plan to continue to incorporate this concept in some of our new international theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	Digital features are not susceptible to scratching and fading; therefore digital presentations remain clear and sharp for every screening.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	This format enables us to more efficiently move titles between auditoriums within a theatre to appropriately address demand for each title.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	Digital projection also allows us to present 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan, or the MET, opera and other special presentations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S4	Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images that create an immersive experience for the patron.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S5	A premium is charged for a 3-D presentation.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S6	Thirty-three titles released during each of 2012 and 2013 were available in 3-D format, and 29 3-D titles are currently expected to be released during 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P7_S7	In addition, 35 3-D titles already have release dates reserved during 2015 through 2018.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	During 2013, through a joint venture named Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, the motion picture exhibition industry developed a content delivery network that allows for delivery of all digital content to U.S. theatres via satellite.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Delivery of content via satellite may reduce film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives will be eliminated.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	The industry is also exploring the expansion of this satellite delivery technology to Latin American markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry has a track record of long-term growth, with box office revenues growing at an estimated compound annual growth rate of 1.73% from 2002 to 2012.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Against this background of steady long-term growth, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance, and consequently box office revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Industry box office records were set during 2012 due to growth in attendance and ticket price.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	While 2013 industry statistics have not yet been published, industry sources estimate that 2013 U.S. box office revenues were approximately $10.9 billion, an approximate 1% increase over 2012, and an all-time industry record.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	During the 2013 summer season, which generally covers May through July, all-time box office revenue records were also set and attendance reached a four-year high.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	The following table represents the results of a survey by Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, published during March 2013, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2003 to 2012:
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S6	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2013 included Iron Man 3, Despicable Me 2, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Monsters University, Frozen, Man of Steel, Fast Furious 6, Oz: The Great and Powerful, Gravity, World War Z, Thor: the Dark World, Star Trek Into Darkness, The Croods, Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, The Heat, The Conjuring, We re the Millers, Identity Thief and The Great Gatsby, among other films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P9_S7	The film slate for 2014 currently includes sequels such as Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I, Hobbit: There and Back Again, Transformers 4, Amazing Spider-Man 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier and new films such as The Lego Movie, Maleficent , and Interstellar, among other films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	International Markets International box office revenues continue to grow.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $23.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, which is a result of strong economies, ticket price increases and new theatre construction.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, representing an 8% increase from 2011.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	Growth in Latin America continues to be fueled by a combination of robust economies, growing populations, an emerging middle class, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), substantial retail development, and quality product from Hollywood, including an increasing number of 3-D films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P10_S4	In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe many international markets for theatrical exhibition have historically been underserved and that certain of these markets, especially those in Latin America, will continue to experience growth as new theatre concepts and platforms are introduced, film product offerings continue to expand and the local economies continue to grow.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Drivers of Continued Industry Success We believe the following market trends will drive the continued growth and strength of our industry: Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands and Subsequent Markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	A successful theatrical release which brands a film is one of the major contributors to its success in downstream markets, such as digital downloads, DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success .
1385280_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $23.9 billion, or approximately 69% of 2012 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will become even more significant.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	Many of the top U.S. films released recently also performed exceptionally well in international markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P13_S4	Such films included Iron Man 3 , which grossed approximately $806.3 million in international markets, or approximately 66% of its worldwide box office, and Despicable Me 2 , which grossed approximately $567.1 million in international markets, or 61% of its worldwide box office.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the industry.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Even during the recent recessionary period, attendance levels remained stable as consumers selected the theatre as a preferred value for their discretionary income.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	With the motion picture exhibition industry s transition to satellite digital technology, the products offered by motion picture exhibitors continue to expand, attracting a broader base of patrons.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	According to industry sources, box office growth for 2012 set an industry record and box office during the 2013 summer season reached a four-year high.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $7.96 in 2012.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Average prices in 2012 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $27.00 to $78.00 per ticket according to MPAA.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Innovation with Digital and Satellite Technology.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our industry began converting to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Digital projection combined with satellite delivery allows exhibitors to expand their product offerings, including the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	Such alternative entertainment includes pre-recorded programs as well as live sports programs, concert events, the MET opera and other special presentations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	New and enhanced programming alternatives may expand the industry s customer base and increase patronage for exhibitors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: Experienced Management.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	from 17 to 55 years, executing a focused strategy that has led to consistent operating results.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	This management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	We generated operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. of $415.5 million and $148.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined operating philosophy that centers on building high-quality market-adaptive theatres, while negotiating favorable theatre level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have a leading market share in the U.S. metropolitan and suburban markets we serve.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013, we ranked either first or second, based on box office revenues, in 23 out of our top 30 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Sacramento and Pittsburgh.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P20_S4	Located in Top Latin American Markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Since 1993, we have invested throughout Latin America in response to the continued growth of the region.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we operated 148 theatres and 1,106 screens in 12 countries.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our international screens generated revenues of $783.1 million, or 29.2% of our total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in the region, with theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S5	Our geographic diversity makes us an important distribution channel for the movie studios.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S6	We offer state-of-the-art theatres, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S7	During 2013, we opened 709 new state-of-the-art screens worldwide.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S8	We currently have commitments to open 263 additional new screens over the next three years.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S9	We have installed digital projection technology in 100% of our U.S. first-run auditoriums and approximately 86% of our international auditoriums, with plans to install digital projection technology in 100% of our international auditoriums in early 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S10	Currently, approximately 52% of our U.S. screens and 58% of our international screens are 3-D compatible.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S11	We currently have fourteen digital IMAX screens.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S12	As of December 31, 2013, we had the industry-leading PLF circuit with 150 XD auditoriums in our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S13	We have plans to install 45 to 55 additional XD auditoriums during 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S14	We also continue to develop new theatre concepts in various markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S15	We continue to grow organically as well as through the acquisition of high-quality theatres in select markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S16	Our growth strategy has centered around achieving a target return on investment while also complementing our existing theatre circuit.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S17	We continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which demonstrates the success of our growth strategy.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S18	We believe our expected level of cash flows will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities, while also allowing us to efficiently service our debt obligations and continue to offer our stockholders a strong dividend yield under our current dividend policy.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S19	We believe our disciplined operating philosophy and experienced management team will enable us to continue to enhance our leading position in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S20	Key components of our strategy include: Growth in Existing and New Markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S21	We will continue to seek growth opportunities by building or acquiring high-quality theatres that meet our strategic, financial and demographic criteria.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S22	We also monitor economic and market trends to ensure our existing theatres offer a broad range of products, prices and platforms that satisfy our patrons and develop new concepts to adapt to our patrons preferences.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S23	We opened two locations with our new Cinemark Movie Bistro concept during 2013 and have plans to open two theaters in the U.S. with our new premium concept during 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P21_S24	We also have plans to open state-of-the-art theatres in Bolivia in 2014 and Paraguay during 2015.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Continue to Focus on Operational Excellence.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	We will continue to focus on achieving operational excellence by controlling theatre operating costs and adequately training and motivating our staff while continuing to provide leading customer service.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our consistent margins reflect our ability to anticipate and manage changes in product and patron preferences.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	Our commitment to technological innovation has resulted in us being 100% digital in our U.S. first-run auditoriums as of December 31, 2013, 2,329 of which are 3-D compatible.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	Approximately 86% of our international auditoriums were digital as of December 31, 2013, 644 of which are 3-D compatible.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	See further discussion of our digital expansion at Technology Innovations .
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S6	We expect to be 100% digital worldwide in early 2014, with approximately 50-60% of our screens 3-D compatible.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P22_S7	We will also continue to expand our worldwide XD auditorium footprint.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Theatre Operations As of December 31, 2013, we operated 482 theatres and 5,563 screens in 40 states and 12 Latin American countries.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	The following tables summarize the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	(1) Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	We first entered Latin America when we began operating movie theatres in Chile in 1993.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Since then, through our focused international strategy, we have developed into the most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the region.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, currently operating theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor, with 497 and 168 screens, respectively, as of December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S5	We intend to build and expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S6	We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations in the markets in which we operate by transacting in their respective local currencies.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S7	Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P25_S8	Our international revenues were approximately $783.1 million during 2013 compared to $777.7 million during 2012.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors, which are made up of the traditional major film companies, specialized and art divisions of some of these major film companies, and many other independent film distributors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	We are responsible for booking the films in negotiated film licensing zones, which are either free film licensing zones or competitive film licensing zones.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	In free film licensing zones, movies can be booked without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors within that area.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	In competitive film licensing zones, the distributor allocates its movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Of the 292 film licensing zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate, approximately 92% operate in free film licensing zones.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	In free film licensing zones, we select those films that we believe will be the most successful from those offered by film distributors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Internationally, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	In the international marketplace, films are not allocated to a single theatre in a geographic film zone, but played by competitive theatres simultaneously.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our patrons, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	Of the 1,106 screens we operate in international markets, approximately 87% have no direct competition from other theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our film rental fees in the U.S. are generally based on a film s box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms, a sliding scale formula, or a mutually agreed upon settlement, subject to the film licensing agreement with the film distributor.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon percentage of box office receipts.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Internationally, our film rental fees are primarily based on mutually agreed upon firm terms that are based upon a specified percentage of box office receipts.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	We regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres, providing a variety of film choices to our patrons.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Bringing art and independent films to our theatres allows us to benefit from the growth in the art and independent market driven by the more mature patron and increased interest in art, foreign and documentary films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	The performance of films such as Lee Daniel s The Butler, 12 Years a Slave, Blue Jasmine and American Hustle have demonstrated the box office potential of art and independent films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	Food and Beverage Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 32% of total revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have devoted considerable management effort to increase concession sales and improve operating margins by expanding our offerings and adapting to our customer preferences, as discussed below.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Through our Cinemark Movie Bistro concept, we have expanded our concession product offerings to include food options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	We have also added lobby bars in certain theatres and plan to include VIP lounges in certain of our future theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	We offer concession products that primarily include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juice blends, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Different varieties and flavors of candy and drinks are offered at theatres based on preferences in that particular market.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our proprietary point of sale system allows us to monitor product sales and make changes to product mix when necessary, which also allows us to quickly take advantage of national as well as regional product launches.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase average concession purchases as well as to attract new buyers.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P35_S4	We offer specially priced combinations at many of our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P35_S5	We periodically offer our loyal patrons opportunities to receive a discount on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discount off the regular price.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	Consumer promotions conducted at the concession stand usually include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving patrons in an expedited manner.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	We have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices, impulse purchases and superior visibility of concession items.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Concession supplies are distributed through a national distribution network.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	The concession distributor supplies and distributes inventory to the theatres, which place orders directly with the vendors to replenish stock.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	We conduct a weekly inventory of all concession products at each theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained for business.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Pre-Feature Screen Advertising In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	In addition, we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S5	As of December 31, 2013, we had an approximate 19% ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P40_S6	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	During 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, began handling all of our screen advertising functions in Brazil.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Our Flix Media marketing personnel work directly with local advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to another exhibitor in Brazil through a revenue share agreement.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	In Argentina, we also have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S4	We are currently integrating our Argentina advertising team with our Flix Media division.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S5	In our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S6	The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S7	In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens, while at our other locations, our in-house marketing personnel handle screen advertising.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S8	We will continue to expand Flix Media into our other international locations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P41_S9	In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Media s services to include, among other things, alternative content, online ticketing, and loyalty initiatives.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	The motion picture exhibition has undertaken significant technology initiatives over the past few years that have transformed the industry, as discussed below.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Participation in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners During 2007, us, AMC Entertainment Inc., or AMC, and Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, entered into a joint venture known as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners LLC, or DCIP, to facilitate the implementation of digital cinema in our U.S. theatres and to establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the financing of digital cinema.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	Digital cinema developments are managed by DCIP, subject to certain approvals by us, AMC and Regal with each of us having an equal voting interest in DCIP.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	DCIP s wholly-owned subsidiary Kasima executed long-term deployment agreements with all of the major motion picture studios, under which Kasima receives a virtual print fee from such studios for each digital presentation.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	In accordance with these agreements, the digital projection systems deployed by Kasima comply with the technology and security specifications developed by the Digital Cinema Initiatives studio consortium.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Kasima leases digital projection systems to us, AMC and Regal under master lease agreements that have an initial term of 12 years.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	On March 10, 2010, we signed a master lease agreement and other related agreements (collectively the agreements ) with Kasima.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had a 33% voting interest in DCIP and a 24.3% economic interest in DCIP.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2013, 96% of our 4,457 U.S. auditoriums were digital, 3,619 of which are leased from Kasima and 2,329 of which are equipped for exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	International Markets In our international markets, we continue to convert our auditoriums to digital projection technology.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	The digital projection systems we deploy are generally funded with operating cash flows generated by each international country.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	We also have virtual print fee agreements with certain major studios under which the studios pay us for certain prints shown on the digital projection equipment.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P46_S3	As of December 31, 2013, we had 950 digital auditoriums in our international markets, 644 of which are capable of exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P46_S4	Similar to our domestic markets, we expect to be digital 100% in our international markets in early 2014.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition We participate in a joint venture with Regal, AMC, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and Universal Pictures named Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, which began delivering digital content to theatres via satellite during October 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	Delivery of content via satellite may reduce film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives will be eliminated.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	The satellite delivery system established by DCDC is available to all exhibitors and content providers and allows live and store-and-forward content to be delivered to our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P47_S3	The industry is also exploring the expansion of this satellite delivery technology to Latin American markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	AC JV, LLC Due to the transformation of technology within our industry, we have the opportunity to continue to expand the content provided to our patrons.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	During December 2013, we formed a joint venture with Regal and AMC named AC JV, LLC, who then purchased the Fathom event business from NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Fathom event business generally focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres feature film schedules.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	With the formation of AC JV, LLC, we, along with Regal and AMC, can ensure proper resources are focused on the continued development and enhancement of alternative content.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Marketing In the U.S., we rely on Internet advertising and also newspaper directory film schedules for marketing our products.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Radio and television advertising spots are used to promote certain motion pictures and special events.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	We exhibit previews of coming attractions and films we are currently playing as part of our pre-feature program.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	We offer patrons access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com , and via our smart phone and tablet applications.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	Customers subscribing to our weekly emails receive targeted information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about advanced ticket sales, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	We partner with film distributors to use monthly web contests to drive traffic to our website and to ensure that customers visit often.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S5	In addition, we work with all of the film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films with local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S6	These programs may involve customer contests, cross-promotions with the media and third parties and other means to increase patronage for a particular film showing at our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S7	We created a smartphone and tablet application called CineMode that allows patrons the opportunity to earn rewards while being courteous during the show.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S8	Our innovative technology was designed to address texting and other cell phone distractions, which is the number one complaint of movie-goers.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S9	While in CineMode, the smart phone screen is automatically dimmed and patrons are prompted to silence their volume.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S10	If CineMode is enabled for the duration of the movie, patrons are rewarded with exclusive digital rewards and offers that can be used at their next visit to Cinemark.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S11	CineMode facilitates contact with our patrons and this initiative provides an opportunity for us to further improve our relationships with the studios and our vendors via couponing and promotions, such as discounted digital downloads.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P51_S12	To date, more than three and a half million patrons have already downloaded CineMode.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Internationally, we exhibit upcoming and current film previews on-screen, partner with film distributors for certain promotions and advertise our new locations through various forms of media and events.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	We partner with large multi-national corporations in the large metropolitan areas in which we have theatres to promote our brand and image as well as increase attendance levels at our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our customers are encouraged to register on our website to receive weekly information by email for showtime information, invitations to special screenings, sponsored events and promotional information.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	In addition, our customers can request to receive showtime information on their cell phones.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	In addition, we have a smartphone application, which allows consumers to check showtimes and purchase tickets for our Brazil theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S6	Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P52_S7	We market these programs to such business representatives as realtors, human resource managers, incentive program managers and hospital and pharmaceutical personnel.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Gift cards can be purchased for certain of our locations at our theatres or online through our website, www.cinemark.com .
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	SuperSavers are also sold online at www.cinemark.com or via phone, fax or email by our local corporate offices and are also available at certain retailers in the U.S.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	Our patrons may purchase advance tickets for all of our domestic screens and a majority of our international screens by accessing our corporate website at www.cinemark.com.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S4	Advance tickets may also be purchased for our domestic screens at www.fandango.com.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S5	Our mobile phone and tablet applications also offer patrons the ability to purchase tickets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S6	Our Internet initiatives help improve customer satisfaction, allowing patrons who purchase tickets over the Internet to bypass lines at the box office by printing their tickets at home, picking up their tickets at kiosks located at the theatre, or scanning a barcode confirmation from their mobile device at the usher stand.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S7	We have developed our own proprietary point of sale system to enhance our ability to maximize revenues, control costs and efficiently manage operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P53_S8	The system is currently installed in all of our U.S. theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The point of sale system provides corporate management with real-time admissions and concession revenues data and reports to allow for timely changes to movie schedules, including extending film runs, increasing the number of screens on which successful movies are being played, or substituting films when gross receipts do not meet expectations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	Real-time seating, as well as reserved seating, and box office information is available to box office personnel, preventing overselling of a particular film and providing faster and more accurate responses to customer inquiries regarding showtimes and available seating.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	The system tracks concession sales by product, provides in-theatre inventory reports for efficient inventory management and control, offers numerous ticket pricing options, connects with digital concession signage for real-time pricing modifications, integrates Internet ticket sales and processes credit card transactions.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P54_S3	Barcode scanners, pole displays, touch screens, credit card readers and other equipment are integrated with the system to enhance its functionality and provide print-at-home and mobile ticketing.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P54_S4	In our international locations, we currently use other point of sale systems that have been developed by third parties, which have been certified as compliant with applicable governmental regulations and provide generally the same capabilities as our proprietary point of sale system.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Competition We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting patrons, licensing films and developing new theatre sites.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal, AMC and Carmike Cinemas, Inc. and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include GSR, Cin polis, Village Theatres and Cinemundo.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	Of the 292 film licensing zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate, approximately 92% operate in free film licensing zones.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	In free film licensing zones, we select those films that we believe will be the most successful from those offered by film distributors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	Where there is competition, the distributor allocates their movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	Of the 1,106 screens we operate outside of the U.S., approximately 87% of those screens have no direct competition from other theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	In areas where we face direct competition, our success in attracting patrons depends on location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue and patron potential, and financial stability.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S6	We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P56_S7	We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	The timing of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Corporate Operations Our worldwide headquarters is located in Plano, Texas.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight for our domestic and international theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Personnel at our Plano headquarters include our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax, audit and information technology support.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our U.S. operations are divided into eighteen regions, primarily organized geographically, each of which is headed by a region leader.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	We have seven regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in twelve countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are operated out of one Central American regional office).
1385280_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Each regional office is headed by a general manager and generally includes personnel in film licensing, marketing, human resources, information systems, operations and accounting.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	We have a chief financial officer in Brazil and Argentina, which are our two largest international markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	The regional offices are staffed with experienced personnel from the region to mitigate cultural and operational barriers.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Employees We have approximately 17,200 employees in the U.S., approximately 18% of whom are full time employees and 82% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	markets, approximately 41% of whom are full time employees and approximately 59% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors is subject to consent decrees resulting from these cases.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including us, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	We develop new theatres to be accessible to the disabled and we believe we are substantially compliant with current regulations relating to accommodating the disabled.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	Although we believe that our theatres comply with the ADA, we have been a party to lawsuits which claim that our handicapped seating arrangements do not comply with the ADA or that we are required to provide closed captioning for patrons who are deaf or are severely hearing impaired and descriptive devices for patrons who are blind.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S5	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S6	We currently have operations in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala, which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P64_S7	See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business depends on film production and performance.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	Poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P65_S3	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P65_S4	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with seven major film distributors accounting for approximately 86% of U.S. box office revenues and 44 of the top 50 grossing films during 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from these antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The motion picture industry is highly competitive.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P72_S3	The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P72_S4	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	An increase in the use of alternative or downstream film distribution channels and other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, pay-per-view television and the Internet.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S3	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S4	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels or competing forms of entertainment could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S5	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video release windows.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S6	Over the last decade, the average video release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, an important downstream market, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P73_S7	If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Film studios have started to offer consumers a premium video on-demand option for certain films 60 days following the theatrical release, which caused the release window to shrink further for certain films.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	We cannot assure you that these release windows, which are determined by the studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P74_S4	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P74_S5	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P75_S2	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P75_S3	We have 148 theatres with 1,106 screens in twelve countries in Latin America.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P75_S4	Brazil represented approximately 12% of our consolidated 2013 revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and transfers abroad, all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our international operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S4	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S5	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S6	As of December 31, 2013, we had $1,832.8 million in long-term debt obligations, $216.4 million in capital lease obligations and $2,065.1 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S7	We incurred interest expense of $124.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S8	We incurred $307.9 million of facility lease expense under operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P76_S9	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk to you by:
1385280_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	We cannot assure you that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or that future borrowings will be available under our amended senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P77_S4	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P77_S5	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our amended senior secured credit facility.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our amended senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in the loss of your investment.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P79_S2	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P79_S3	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P79_S4	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	In 2005, we joined Regal and AMC as founding members of NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 19%.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P80_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company received approximately $7.1 million and $8.0 million in other revenues from NCM, respectively, and $20.8 million and $20.7 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S4	While we continue to implement the latest technological innovations, such as digital projection, 3-D and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S5	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S6	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S7	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S8	We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S9	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P81_S10	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	We cannot assure you that our expansion strategy will result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P83_S2	We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing or that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	If we do not comply with the ADA and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	On November 15, 2004, we and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S5	We depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S6	Our current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S7	The loss or unavailability of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could significantly impair our business.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S8	We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S9	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S10	We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S11	We assess many factors when determining whether to impair individual theatre assets, including actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P85_S12	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the theatre assets, the theatre assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Since we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	We have a significant amount of goodwill.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using a two-step approach under which we compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step would be performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Fair values are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could negatively affect our estimated fair values and could result in further impairments of goodwill.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	We also have a significant amount of tradename intangible assets.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Management s estimates are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	We recorded asset impairment charges of $7.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	We cannot assure you that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future, and such charges may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P93_S4	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	The impairment or insolvency of certain financial institutions could adversely affect us.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	We have exposure to different counterparties with regard to our interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	These transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties to such agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	We also have exposure to financial institutions used as depositories of our corporate cash balances.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	If our counterparties or financial institutions become impaired or insolvent, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or impair our ability to access our cash.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S4	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S5	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P95_S6	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P96_S2	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P96_S3	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P96_S4	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our amended senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long term debt agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us, even though such proposals may be beneficial to you.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	Certain provisions of our 4.875% senior notes indenture, our 5.125% senior notes indenture, our 7.375% senior subordinated notes indenture and our amended senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of our 4.875% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of our 5.125% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S4	A change of control , as defined in the 7.375% senior subordinated notes indenture, would require us to make an offer to repurchase the senior subordinated notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S5	A change of control would also be an event of default under our amended senior secured credit facility.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S6	The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P101_S7	There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our Common Stock will continue.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	The securities markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and the market prices of the securities of companies have been particularly volatile.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	This market volatility, as well as general economic or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our Common Stock regardless of our operating performance.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors and, in response, the market price of our Common Stock may decrease significantly and prevent investors from reselling their shares of our Common Stock at or above a market price that is favorable to other stockholders.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs, liabilities and a diversion of management s attention and resources.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P103_S3	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P103_S4	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.

1385280_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had 115,382,538 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P104_S3	Of these shares, approximately 103,679,157 shares were freely tradable.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P104_S4	The remaining shares of our Common Stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P104_S5	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.

1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	The sale of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options could further dilute your investment in our Common Stock and adversely affect our stock price.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S3	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S4	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S5	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S6	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_14_ITEM1_P106_S7	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.

1385280_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	We operated theatres in Mexico until November 15, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Revenues and Expenses We generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our contracts with NCM have assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising and third party branding.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Historically, we have also offered alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the MET opera and other special presentations in our theatres through our relationship with NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	We will continue to offer this entertainment through our recently formed joint venture, AC JV, LLC.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our Flix Media initiative has allowed us to expand our screen advertising within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2013 included Iron Man 3, Despicable Me 2, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Monsters University, Frozen, Man of Steel, Fast Furious 6, Oz: The Great and Powerful, Gravity, World War Z, Thor: the Dark World, Star Trek Into Darkness, The Croods, Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, The Heat, The Conjuring, We re the Millers, Identity Thief and The Great Gatsby, among other films.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our revenues are affected by changes in attendance and concession revenues per patron.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Attendance is primarily affected by the quality and quantity of films released by motion picture studios.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	The film slate for 2014 currently includes sequels such as Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I, Hobbit: There and Back Again, Transformers 4, Amazing Spider-Man 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier and new films such as The Lego Movie , Maleficent , and Interstellar, among other films.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	Film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	Film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	The monthly cost of these advertisements is based on, among other things, the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Utilities and other costs include certain costs that have both fixed and variable components such as utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P10_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S8	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P14_S9	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and a period of approximately twenty years for fee owned properties.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011, 2012 and 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of our eighteen regions in the U.S. and each of our seven international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The evaluation is a two-step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was seven and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011 and 2012 and eight times for the evaluation performed during 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	We increased the multiple of cash flows used for the evaluation performed during the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in industry trading multiples, and the increase in our stock price and resulting market capitalization.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by at least 10%.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).

1385280_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc. , a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment).
1385280_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P41_S8	Recent Developments Dividend Declaration On February 14, 2014, our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2013 of $0.25 per common share payable to stockholders of record on March 4, 2014.

1385280_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Ratings We are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency s evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	Below are our latest credit ratings, which were published by the respective agency during May 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	B With respect to the ratings issued by Moody s as noted above, Moody s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Ba1 Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	B2 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	B3 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Prime-3 portion of the rating indicates issuer has an acceptable ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor s as noted above, Standard and Poor s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	B More vulnerable to adverse business, financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	BB+ Considered highest speculative grade by market participants.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	BB- Less vulnerable in the near-term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business, financial and economic conditions.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements During February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2013-02 ).
1385280_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	ASU 2013-02 amended existing guidance by requiring additional disclosure either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	ASU 2013-02 requires prospective adoption and affects financial statement disclosures only.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P104_S3	For public entities, the new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	The adoption of ASU 2013-02 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	See Note 13 for changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, including amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P106_S3	The timing of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	We have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	At December 31, 2013, there was an aggregate of approximately $243.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities, which excludes $450.0 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s term loan debt that is hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements as discussed below.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2013, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.4 million.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	All of our current interest rate swap agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P108_S3	Below is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2013:
1385280_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2013:
1385280_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	(1) Includes $450.0 million of the Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan, which represents the debt currently hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P112_S1	A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P112_S2	U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P112_S3	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P112_S4	Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments.
1385280_14_ITEM7_P112_S5	Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $50 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 by approximately $9 million, $8 million and $7 million, respectively.

1385280_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of Cinemark Holdings, Inc.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P9_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_14_ITEM8_P10_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P13_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) is a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States ( U.S. ), Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P13_S1	The Company operated theatres in Mexico until November 15, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P13_S2	The Company also managed additional theatres in the U.S., Brazil, and Colombia during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P14_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P14_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P14_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P14_S4	Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating funds held in financial institutions, petty cash held by the theatres and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P15_S1	Cash investments were primarily in money market funds or other similar funds.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P16_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which are recorded at net realizable value, consists primarily of receivables related to screen advertising, receivables related to discounted tickets sold to retail locations, rebates earned from the Company s beverage and other concession vendors and value-added and other non-income tax receivables.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P17_S0	Inventories Concession and theatre supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P17_S1	Theatre Properties and Equipment Theatre properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P18_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
1385280_14_ITEM10_P19_S0	Lesser of lease term or useful life The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P19_S1	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P20_S0	assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P20_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P20_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and for fee owned properties, the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P21_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P21_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P22_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P23_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P23_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011, 2012 and 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P23_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P24_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of theatre businesses acquired.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P24_S1	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P24_S2	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P24_S3	The Company considers the reporting unit to be each of its eighteen regions in the U.S. and each of its seven international countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_14_ITEM10_P25_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P25_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P26_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P26_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was seven and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2011 and 2012 and eight times for the evaluation performed during 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P26_S3	The Company increased the multiple of cash flows used for the evaluation performed during the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in industry trading multiples, and the increase in the Company s stock price and resulting market capitalization.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P27_S0	Indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P28_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the Company s tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P28_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P30_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P31_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_14_ITEM10_P32_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P32_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from one to seven years.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P33_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P33_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from one to twenty-three years.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P34_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement or the expected useful life of the intangible asset.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P34_S1	The remaining useful lives of these intangible assets range from one to thirteen years.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P35_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of debt issue costs, long-term prepaid rents, construction related deposits, lease deposits, equipment to be placed in service, and other assets of a long-term nature.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P36_S0	Debt issue costs are amortized using the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over the primary financing terms of the related debt agreement.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P37_S0	Long-term prepaid rents represent prepayments of rent on operating leases.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P37_S1	These payments are recognized as facility lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P37_S2	The amortization periods generally range from one to six years.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P38_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P38_S1	If substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership have been transferred to the Company as lessee, the Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P39_S0	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P40_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P40_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P40_S2	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P40_S3	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P40_S4	At the end of the construction period, the Company determines if the transaction qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment in regards to lease classification.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P40_S5	If the Company receives a lease incentive payment from a landlord, the Company records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the initial term of the respective lease.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P41_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P41_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P41_S2	Revenues related to these advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P42_S0	The Company is self-insured for general liability claims subject to an annual cap.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P42_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, claims were capped at $250 per occurrence with an annual cap of approximately $2,600.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P42_S2	The Company is also self-insured for medical claims up to $125 per occurrence.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S0	Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company s insurance reserves were $7,693 and $9,776, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S2	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S3	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S4	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S5	The Company records proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S6	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P43_S7	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company s liabilities for advanced sale-type certificates were approximately $46,063 and $55,024, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P44_S1	The Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $7,846, $9,093 and $10,684 during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P45_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P45_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a mutually agreed upon percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P46_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P46_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P47_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P47_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P47_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P47_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P48_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity award based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P48_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using a market observed price, if such a price exists.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P48_S2	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_14_ITEM10_P48_S3	At the time of the grant, the Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P48_S4	See Note 18 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P49_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P49_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P49_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P50_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P50_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P51_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P51_S1	The first step is recognition: The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P52_S0	evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P53_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P53_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P53_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_14_ITEM10_P54_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P55_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P56_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P56_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P56_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P57_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P57_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P57_S2	See Note 15 for a summary of the translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P58_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P59_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P60_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P60_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P60_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S0	The Company has interest rate swap agreements and investments in marketable securities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S1	With respect to its interest rate swap agreements, the Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S2	Therefore, the Company s fair value measurements for its interest rate swaps use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S3	With respect to its investments in marketable securities, the Company uses quoted market prices, which fall under Level 1 of the hierarchy.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S4	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S5	See Note 13 for further discussion of the Company s interest rate swap agreements and Note 14 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S6	The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis, primarily in the impairment evaluations for goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P61_S7	See Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Theatre Properties and Equipment included above for discussion of such fair value measurements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P62_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P62_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P62_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P63_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts realized.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P63_S1	The Company provides assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P63_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P63_S3	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P63_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P63_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methodologies utilized by the third party valuation firm.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P66_S0	The Company considers its unvested share based payment awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities, and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P67_S0	Basic earnings per share for the two classes of stock (common stock and unvested restricted stock) is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P67_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock plus the potentially dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding determined under both the two class method and the treasury stock method.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P77_S0	LLC The Company has an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ).
1385280_14_ITEM10_P77_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P77_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCMI ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior ESA, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S4	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S5	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron, initially seven cents, and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for certain reasons outlined in the modified ESA.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S6	The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the first such increase taking effect after the end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P78_S7	For 2011, 2012 and 2013, the annual payment per digital screen was nine hundred seventy-two dollars, one thousand twenty-one dollars and one thousand seventy-two dollars, respectively.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P79_S0	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P79_S1	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P79_S2	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 23 years.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P80_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P80_S1	Following the NCM, Inc. IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P80_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P80_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P80_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data Common Unit Adjustments Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCMI and the Company, AMC and Regal, which we refer to collectively as the Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, we follow the guidance in FASB ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S2	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S3	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S4	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P81_S7	Our Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S0	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S1	If the Company then elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Tranche 2 Investment at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S2	Below is a summary of common units received by the Company under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013:
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S3	Each common unit received by the Company is convertible into one share of NCMI common stock.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S4	The fair value of the common units received was estimated based on the market price of NCMI stock at the time that the common units were received, adjusted for volatility associated with the estimated period of time it would take to convert the common units and register the respective shares.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S5	The fair value measurement used for the common units falls under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P82_S6	The Company records additional common units it receives as part of its Tranche 2 Investment at estimated fair value with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P86_S2	Upon signing the Agreements, the Company contributed the majority of its U.S. digital projection systems to DCIP, which DCIP then contributed to Kasima.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P86_S3	The Company has a variable interest in Kasima through the terms of its master equipment lease agreement; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Kasima, as the Company does not have the ability to direct the activities of Kasima that most significantly impact Kasima s economic performance.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P90_S1	The digital projection systems are being leased from Kasima under an operating lease with an initial term of twelve years that contains ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P90_S2	The equipment lease agreement also contains a fair value purchase option.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P90_S3	Under the equipment lease agreement, the Company pays minimum annual rent of one thousand dollars per digital projection system for the first six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement and minimum annual rent of three thousand dollars per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date through the end of the lease term.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P90_S4	The Company may also be subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P90_S5	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P91_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had 3,619 digital projection systems being leased under the master equipment lease agreement with Kasima.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P92_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data The digital projection systems leased from Kasima replaced a majority of the Company s existing 35 millimeter projection systems in its U.S. theatres.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P92_S1	Therefore, upon signing the agreements during 2010, the Company began accelerating the depreciation of these existing 35 millimeter projection systems.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P92_S2	The Company recorded depreciation expense of approximately $10,604 on its domestic 35 millimeter projection systems during the year ended December 31, 2011.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P129_S0	INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS The Company is currently a party to three interest rate swap agreements that are used to hedge interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rates on the Company s term loan debt and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P129_S1	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P129_S2	The changes in fair values are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P130_S0	The valuation technique used to determine fair value is the income approach and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P130_S1	Therefore, the Company s measurements use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35.

1385280_14_ITEM10_P135_S3	The Company determined that the forecasted transactions hedged by this interest rate swap are still probable to occur, thus the total amount previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this interest rate swap agreement of $18,147 was amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the period during which the forecasted transactions were expected to occur, which was September 15, 2008 through August 13, 2012.
1385280_14_ITEM10_P135_S4	The Company amortized approximately $4,236 and $2,470 to interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

1385280_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	We are the most geographically diverse worldwide exhibitor, with theatres in fourteen countries as of December 31, 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P3_S3	As of December 31, 2014, our U.S. circuit had 335 theatres and 4,499 screens in 41 states and our international circuit had 160 theatres and 1,177 screens.

1385280_15_ITEM1_P3_S6	Approximately $236.0 million, or 13%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and approximately $8.4 million of our long-term debt matures in 2015.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we built 18 new theatres with 152 screens and acquired two theatres with 18 screens.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	We believe our portfolio of modern high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid cash flows from operating activities.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly considering the expanding worldwide box office.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our market leadership is attributable in large part to our senior operational executives, whose years of industry experience range from 18 to 56 years and who have successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	We continue to develop and expand new platforms and market adaptive concepts for our theatre circuit, including NextGen, Cin Arts, Cinemark Bistro, Cinemark Reserve and other premium concepts, such as our Cinemark XD Extreme Digital Cinema, or XD.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our NextGen theatre complexes have wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens in every auditorium, along with the latest digital projection and sound technologies.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	These theatres generally also have an XD auditorium.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Cin Arts locations provide moviegoers with the best selection of art and independent cinema in a captivating, unique environment and has set the industry standard for providing distinct, acclaimed and award-winning films.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Cinemark Bistro locations offer in-theatre dining with great tasting food options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We currently have two theatres with the movie bistro concept and we plan to expand the concept to two new domestic locations over the next few years.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	During 2014, we opened one Cinemark Reserve theatre in the U.S., which features a VIP area with luxury seating and other amenities, along with a wide variety of food and beverage products.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	We will open a second Cinemark Reserve theatre in the U.S. during the first part of 2015.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	We have a similar VIP concept in five other domestic locations and in 38 of our international auditoriums, referred to locally as either Cinemark Premiere or Cinemark Prime.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S5	We plan to continue to incorporate this concept in certain of our new domestic and international theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S6	Our XD screens represent the largest private label premium large format footprint in the industry.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S7	Our XD auditorium offers a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including Dolby Atmos 11.1 or Barco Auro 20.1 in select locations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S8	The XD experience includes wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S9	The exceptional XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in the XD auditorium without any print enhancements required.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P7_S10	As of December 31, 2014, we had 179 XD auditoriums in our worldwide circuit with plans to install 20 to 30 more XD auditoriums during 2015.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S4	This format enables us to more efficiently move titles between auditoriums within a theatre to appropriately address demand for each title.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S5	Currently, 100% of our first-run domestic theatres and 100% of our international theatres are fully digital.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S6	Digital projection allows us to present 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S7	Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images that create an immersive experience for the patron.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S8	Thirty-three titles released during 2013 and 31 titles released during 2014 were available in 3-D format.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S9	The film slate for 2015 currently includes 28 3-D titles, including The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P8_S10	A total of 42 3-D titles have already been announced for 2016 and 2017, including two of the Avatar sequels.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	During 2013, through a joint venture named Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, the motion picture exhibition industry developed a content delivery network that allows for delivery of all digital content to U.S. theatres with the necessary equipment via satellite.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	The industry is starting the expansion of this satellite delivery technology in certain Latin American markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry set an all-time box office record during 2013 with $10.9 billion in revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	Industry statistics have not yet been released for 2014, however industry sources indicate that 2014 U.S. box office revenues were approximately $10.4 billion, a 5.2% decrease from the record-setting 2013.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	The decline in domestic industry performance from 2013 to 2014 was partly due to a shift of certain films into future years as well as less animated content among the films released during 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	The following table represents the results of a survey by Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, published during March 2014, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2004 to 2013:
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2014 included the carryover of Frozen as well as new releases such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The LEGO Movie, Hobbit:
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S5	The Battle of the Five Armies, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Maleficent, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Big Hero 6, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Godzilla, 22 Jump Street, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Interstellar and Divergent , among other films.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P10_S6	Films currently scheduled for wide-release during 2015 include Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II, Disney s Cinderella , Furious 7, American Sniper, 50 Shades of Grey , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Jurassic World , Inside Out , Minions , the 24th James Bond film, The Good Dinosaur and Mission: Impossible 5, among other films.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	International Markets International box office revenues continue to grow.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $25.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a 5% increase over 2012.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	International box office growth is a result of strong economies, ticket price increases and new theatre construction.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing a 7% increase from 2012.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	Growth in Latin America continues to be fueled by a combination of growing populations, an emerging middle class, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), continued retail development, and quality product from Hollywood, including 3-D and alternative content offerings.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S5	In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P11_S6	We believe many international markets will continue to experience growth as new theatre technologies and platforms are introduced, as film and other product offerings continue to expand and as ancillary revenue opportunities grow.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Drivers of Continued Industry Success We believe the following market trends will drive the continued strength of our industry: Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	A successful theatrical release brands a film and is one of the major contributors to a film s success in downstream markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, and network and syndicated television.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success .
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $25.0 billion, or approximately 70%, of 2013 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will become even more significant.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	Many of the top U.S. films released recently also performed exceptionally well in international markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S4	Such films included Transformers: Age of Extinction , which grossed approximately $835.7 million in international markets, or approximately 77% of its worldwide box office, and X Men: Days of Future Past , which grossed approximately $514.0 million in international markets, or approximately 68% of its worldwide box office.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S5	Over the past ten years, industry statistics have shown slight increases and decreases in attendance from one year to another, however domestic box office revenues have grown during this period.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P14_S6	The industry has not experienced highly volatile results, even during recessionary periods, demonstrating the stability of the industry and its continued ability to attract consumers.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $8.13 in 2013.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	Average prices in 2013 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $27.00 to $82.00 per ticket according to MPAA.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Innovation Using Digital and Satellite Technology.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our industry began converting to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our domestic circuit also converted to satellite technology during 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Digital projection combined with satellite delivery allows exhibitors to expand their product offerings, including the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	Alternative entertainment may include pre-recorded programs as well as live sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P16_S5	New and enhanced programming alternatives may expand the industry s customer base and increase patronage for exhibitors.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Introduction of New Platforms and Product Offerings.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	The motion picture exhibition industry continues to develop new movie theatre platforms to attract a broader base of patrons and to respond to varying consumer preferences.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition to changing the overall style of some theatres, concession product offerings have continued to expand to more than just traditional popcorn and candy items.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	Some locations now offer hot foods, adult beverages and/or healthier snack options for patrons.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: Experienced Management.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Tim Warner, President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Copple and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our operational management team has many years of theatre operating experience, ranging from 18 to 56 years, executing a focused strategy that has led to consistent operating results.

1385280_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are also committed to developing new market-adaptive theatres that broaden the range of entertainment options, concession offerings and amenities we provide to our customers.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	While we continue to grow our theatre circuit with new builds and acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our existing theatres to ensure they provide our customers with a comfortable, high-quality entertainment experience for our patrons.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	We spent approximately $125 million and $140 million on maintenance capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Theatre Operations As of December 31, 2014, we operated 495 theatres and 5,676 screens in 41 states and 13 Latin American countries.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	The following tables summarize the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	(1) Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We first entered Latin America when we opened a movie theatre in Chile in 1993.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Since then, through our focused international strategy, we have developed the most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the region.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in twelve of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor, with 516 and 168 screens, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S5	We intend to build and expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S6	We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations in the markets in which we operate by transacting in their respective local currencies.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S7	Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent local currency revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S8	We offer a variety of content at our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S9	We monitor upcoming films and related events and work with film distributors to license the content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S10	We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S11	We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our first-run theatres, and in select locations, we also offer a 4-D format.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S12	The 4-D format features moving seats and added sensory features in addition to the ultra-realistic images of 3-D technology.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S13	We also regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our patrons.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S14	Bringing art and independent films to our theatres allows us to benefit from the growth in the art and independent market driven by the increased interest in art, foreign and documentary films.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S15	We have also established a Classic Series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies that change on a weekly basis.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P26_S16	The program covers many genres of classic films that are generally exhibited during non-peak times.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	During December 2013, we formed a joint venture, named AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC which then purchased the Fathom event business from National CineMedia, LLC.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Fathom event business generally focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres feature film schedules.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	continue to bring alternative events to our theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera, sports programs, concert events, gaming events and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	We, along with AC JV, LLC, will continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide entertainment to consumers.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for our domestic theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	We are responsible for booking the films in film licensing zones, which are either free film licensing zones or competitive film licensing zones.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	In free film licensing zones, movies can be booked without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors within that area.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	In competitive film licensing zones, the distributor allocates its movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S5	We are the sole exhibitor in 92% of the 300 film licensing zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P30_S6	In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	In the international marketplace, films are not allocated based on film licensing zones, but played by competitive theatres simultaneously.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our patrons, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a film s box office receipts.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a firm terms formula under which we pay a mutually agreed upon rate as determined prior to a film s run; a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film s run; or a mutually agreed upon settlement under which the rate is negotiated after a film s run.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Food and Beverage Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 32% of total revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have devoted considerable management effort to increasing concession sales by expanding our offerings and adapting to our customers preferences, as discussed below.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	Concession products offered at all of our theatres include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juice blends, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Different varieties and flavors of candy, snacks and drinks are offered at theatres based on preferences in that particular market.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	We have recently introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our patrons, which are available at some locations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	Through our Cinemark Movie Bistro and Cinemark Reserve concepts, we have expanded our domestic concession product offerings to include more food and drink options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in certain domestic theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S5	Our point of sale system allows us to monitor product sales and make changes to product mix when necessary, which also allows us to quickly take advantage of national as well as regional product launches and promotions.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S6	New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchases as well as to attract new buyers.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S7	We offer specially-priced product combinations at many of our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S8	We periodically offer discounts to our patrons on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discounted price.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P34_S9	In certain international locations, we offer loyalty discounts to frequent patrons.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	Consumer promotions usually include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving patrons in an expedited manner.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	We have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices, impulse purchases and superior visibility of concession items.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	In some of our international locations, we allow patrons to pre-order concession items, either online or at a kiosk, and pick them up in a dedicated line at the concession counter.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and negotiate rebates.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Concession supplies are generally distributed through a distribution network.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	The concession distributor distributes inventory to the theatres, which place orders directly with the vendors to replenish stock.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	We conduct a weekly inventory of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our customers.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Pre-Feature Screen Advertising In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	In addition, we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had an approximate 19% ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P39_S6	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	During 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, began handling all of our screen advertising functions in Brazil.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our Brazil theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to another exhibitor in Brazil through a revenue share agreement.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	In Argentina, we also have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our Argentina theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S4	We are currently integrating our Argentina advertising team with our Flix Media division.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S5	We recently acquired an advertising business in Chile, which we will also integrate with our Flix Media division.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S6	In our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S7	The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S8	In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S9	We will continue to expand Flix Media into our other international locations over the next few years.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P40_S10	In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Media s services to include, among other things, alternative content, online ticketing, and loyalty initiatives.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry has undertaken transformational technology initiatives over the past few years, as discussed below.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Participation in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners Domestic Markets During 2007, Cinemark, AMC, and Regal, entered into a joint venture known as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners LLC, or DCIP, to facilitate the implementation of digital cinema in our U.S. theatres and to establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the financing of digital cinema.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Digital cinema developments are managed by DCIP, subject to certain approvals by Cinemark, AMC and Regal with each of us having an equal voting interest in DCIP.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	DCIP s wholly-owned subsidiary Kasima executed long-term deployment agreements with all of the major motion picture studios, under which Kasima receives a virtual print fee from such studios for each digital presentation.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	In accordance with these agreements, the digital projection systems deployed by Kasima comply with the technology and security specifications developed by the Digital Cinema Initiatives studio consortium.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Kasima leases digital projection systems to us, AMC and Regal under master lease agreements that have an initial term of 12 years.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our master lease agreement and other related agreements (collectively the agreements ) with Kasima were signed during March 2010.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	As of December 31, 2014, 93% of our 4,499 U.S. auditoriums were digital, 3,692 of which are leased from Kasima.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	Digitalization - International Markets In our international markets, we converted our auditoriums to digital projection technology.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S4	The digital projection systems we deployed were generally funded with operating cash flows generated by each international country.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S5	We have virtual print fee agreements with studios under which the studios pay us for certain prints shown on the digital projection equipment.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P43_S6	As of December 31, 2014, 752 of our international auditoriums are capable of exhibiting 3-D content.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition Through the joint venture DCDC with Regal, AMC, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and Universal Pictures, we began delivering digital content to domestic theatres via satellite during October 2013.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	As of December 31, 2014, 100% of our domestic auditoriums were capable of receiving content via satellite.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	The satellite delivery system established by DCDC is available to all exhibitors and content providers and allows live and store-and-forward content to be delivered to our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P44_S4	The industry is beginning to expand this satellite delivery technology to certain Latin American markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	Marketing We generally market our theatres and events using Internet advertising and newspaper directory film schedules.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Radio and television advertising spots are also used to promote certain motion pictures and special events, such as theatre grand openings and VIP events.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	We offer patrons access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	Customers can subscribe to our weekly emails to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	These programs may involve customer contests, cross-promotions with the media and third parties and other means to increase patronage for a particular film showing at our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	CineMode, which is a function within the app we developed, allows patrons the opportunity to earn rewards while being courteous during a show.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our innovative technology was designed to address texting and other cell phone distractions, which is the number one complaint of movie-goers.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	While in CineMode, the phone s screen is automatically dimmed and patrons are prompted to silence their volume.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	If CineMode is enabled for the duration of the movie, patrons are rewarded with exclusive digital rewards and offers that can be used at their next visit to Cinemark.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	CineMode connects us with our patrons and provides an opportunity for us to further expand our relationships with the studios and our vendors through promotions.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We generally market these programs to businesses as an employee-incentive or rewards program.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	We have developed our own proprietary point of sale system to enhance our ability to maximize revenues, control costs and efficiently manage operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P48_S5	The system is currently installed in all of our U.S. theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	The point of sale system provides corporate management with real-time admissions and concession revenues data and reports to allow for timely changes to movie schedules, including extending film runs, adding showtimes based on demand, or substituting films when gross receipts do not meet expectations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	The system tracks concession sales by product, provides in-theatre inventory reports for efficient inventory management and control, offers numerous ticket pricing options, connects with digital concession signage for real-time pricing modifications, integrates Internet ticket sales and processes credit card transactions.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Barcode scanners, pole displays, touch screens, credit card readers and other equipment are integrated with the system to enhance its functionality and facilitate print-at-home and mobile ticketing.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	In our international locations, we currently use point of sale systems that have been developed by third parties, which have been certified as compliant with applicable governmental regulations and offer generally the same capabilities as our proprietary point of sale system.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting patrons, licensing films and developing new theatre sites.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal, AMC and Carmike Cinemas, Inc. and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Kinoplex (GSR), Cin polis, Village Cines, Cine Colombia and Cinemundo.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P51_S3	We are the sole exhibitor in approximately 92% of the 300 film licensing zones in which our first run U.S. theatres operate.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	In competitive zones, the distributor allocates their movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	In areas where we face direct competition, our success in attracting patrons depends on location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue and patron potential, and financial stability.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P52_S4	We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, DVDs, network and syndicated television, video on-demand, and pay-per-view television.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P52_S5	We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Corporate Operations Our worldwide headquarters is located in Plano, Texas.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight for our domestic and international theatres, including our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax, audit and information technology support.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our U.S. operations are divided into eighteen regions, primarily organized geographically, each of which is headed by a region leader.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have seven regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in thirteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are operated out of one Central American regional office).
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	Each regional office is headed by a general manager and generally includes personnel in film licensing, marketing, human resources, information systems, operations and accounting.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	We have chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina, which are our two largest international markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S4	Employees We have approximately 16,500 employees in the U.S., approximately 22% of whom are full time employees and 78% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S5	We have approximately 8,000 employees in our international markets, approximately 30% of whom are full time employees and approximately 70% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S6	Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P56_S7	We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors is subject to consent decrees resulting from these cases.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P58_S2	We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P58_S4	We currently have operations in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Bolivia, which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM1_P58_S5	See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with six major film distributors accounting for approximately 82.6% of U.S. box office revenues and 47 of the top 50 grossing films during 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from the antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The motion picture industry is highly competitive.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In markets where we do not face competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	An increase in the use of alternative film distribution channels or other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video and digital release windows.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Over the last decade, the average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Film studios occasionally offer consumers a premium video on-demand option for certain films shortly after the theatrical release.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These release windows, which are determined by the studios, may shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S9	We have 160 theatres with 1,177 screens in thirteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Brazil represented approximately 12.7% of our consolidated 2014 revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and transfers to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our international operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	As of December 31, 2014, we had $1,823.0 million in long-term debt obligations, $218.5 million in capital lease obligations and $1,814.3 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We incurred interest expense of $113.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S8	We incurred $317.1 million of facility lease expense under operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We may not be able to continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our amended senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our amended senior secured credit facility.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our amended senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S9	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S11	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S12	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S13	As of December 31, 2014, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 19%.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S14	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P11_S15	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company received approximately $8.0 million and $9.2 million in other revenues from NCM, respectively, and $20.7 million and $18.5 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	While we continue to implement the latest technological innovations, such as digital projection, 3-D and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We may not be able to obtain such financing or that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we do not comply with the ADA and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	On November 15, 2004, Cinemark and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We are also subject to certain union regulations in certain of our international markets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	As union wage rates and other requirements change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We have a significant amount of long-lived assets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, therefore if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair values of goodwill and our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our amended senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Certain provisions of our 4.875% senior notes indenture, our 5.125% senior notes indenture, our 7.375% senior subordinated notes indenture and our amended senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 4.875% senior notes, our 5.125% senior notes, and our 7.375% senior subordinated notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	A change of control would also be an event of default under our amended senior secured credit facility.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S6	As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of 180,242,418 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S7	In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S9	As of December 31, 2014, we had 115,700,447 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Of these shares, approximately 104,102,439 shares were freely tradable.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S11	The remaining shares of our Common Stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P24_S12	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2014, there were 7,693,356 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S7	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.
1385280_15_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Cyber security threats and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business.

1385280_15_ITEM1B_P4_S0	Legal Proceedings Joseph Amey, et al. v. Cinemark USA, Inc., Case No. 3:13cv05669, In the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division.
1385280_15_ITEM1B_P4_S1	The case presents putative class action claims for damages and attorney s fees arising from employee wage and hour claims under California law for alleged meal period, rest break, reporting time pay, unpaid wages, pay upon termination, and wage statements violations.
1385280_15_ITEM1B_P5_S0	claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney General Act ( PAGA ).
1385280_15_ITEM1B_P5_S1	We deny the claims, deny that class certification is appropriate and deny that a PAGA representative action is appropriate, and are vigorously defending against the claims.
1385280_15_ITEM1B_P5_S2	The case is in pretrial discovery, no class action has been certified, and no representative action has been quantified or recognized.
1385280_15_ITEM1B_P5_S3	We deny any violation of law and plan to vigorously defend against all claims.
1385280_15_ITEM1B_P5_S4	We are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss, if any; however, we believe that our potential liability with respect to such proceeding is not material in the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

1385280_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Bolivia.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	We operated theatres in Mexico until November 15, 2013.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2014, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Revenues and Expenses We generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our contracts with NCM have assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising and third party branding.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Historically, we have also offered alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera and other special presentations in our theatres through our relationship with NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	We will continue to offer this entertainment through our recently formed joint venture, AC JV, LLC.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our Flix Media initiative has allowed us to expand our screen advertising within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2014 included the carryover of Frozen as well as new releases such as Guardians of the Galaxy, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The LEGO Movie, Hobbit:
1385280_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Battle of the Five Armies, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Maleficent, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Big Hero 6, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Godzilla, 22 Jump Street, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Interstellar and Divergent , among other films.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Films currently scheduled for wide-release during 2015 include Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II, Disney s Cinderella , Furious 7, American Sniper, 50 Shades of Grey , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Jurassic World , Inside Out , Minions , the 24th James Bond film, The Good Dinosaur and Mission: Impossible 5 , among other films.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	Film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P4_S5	The monthly cost of these advertisements is based on, among other things, the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Utilities and other costs include certain costs that have both fixed and variable components such as utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P9_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a mutually agreed upon percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S6	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S7	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S8	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P13_S9	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee owned properties.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2012, 2013 and 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	The evaluation is a two-step approach requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was seven and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2012 and eight times for the evaluations performed during 2013 and 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	We increased the multiple of cash flows used for the evaluation performed during the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in industry trading multiples, and the increase in our stock price and resulting market capitalization.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of goodwill for all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by at least 10%.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We estimate the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc. , a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P39_S8	Recent Developments Dividend Declaration On February 11, 2015, our board of directors approved a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2014 of $0.25 per common share payable to stockholders of record on March 4, 2015.

1385280_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The decrease in admissions revenues was primarily attributable to a 1.9% decrease in attendance, partially offset by a 1.0% increase in average ticket price from $6.95 for 2013 to $7.02 for 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in concession revenues was primarily attributable to a 6.1% increase in concession revenues per patron from $3.44 for 2013 to $3.65 for 2014.

1385280_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	The decrease in admissions revenues was primarily attributable to a 9.5% decrease in attendance and a 1.7% decrease in average ticket price from $4.78 for 2013 to $4.70 for 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The decrease in concession revenues was primarily attributable to the 9.5% decrease in attendance and a 1.7% decrease in concession revenues per patron from $2.37 for 2013 to $2.33 for 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	The decrease in attendance was primarily due to the sale of our Mexico theatres on November 15, 2013.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	The decrease in average ticket price and concession revenues per patron was due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.

1385280_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	The reduction was primarily due to the impact of changes in exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, the sale of our Mexico theatres in November 2013 and a reduction in incentive compensation expense.

1385280_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Prior to June 15, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the Senior Subordinated Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest on the senior subordinated notes to the date of redemption.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	After June 15, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	In addition, prior to June 15, 2014, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes from the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in the indenture.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cinemark USA, Inc. 8.625% Senior Notes On June 29, 2009, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $470.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due 2019 (the 8.625% Senior Notes ), with an original issue discount of $11.5 million, resulting in proceeds of approximately $458.5 million.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	The proceeds were primarily used to fund the repurchase of the then remaining outstanding $419.4 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of Cinemark, Inc. s 9.75% senior discount notes.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	On June 24, 2013, Cinemark USA, Inc. redeemed its 8.625% Senior Notes at 112.035% of the principal amount, inclusive of a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes discussed above.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	As a result of the redemption, we wrote-off approximately $8.0 million in unamortized bond discount and $7.6 million in unamortized debt issue costs, paid a make-whole premium of approximately $56.6 million and paid other fees of $0.1 million, all of which are reflected in loss on early retirement of debt during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2014, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Ratings We are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency s evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P91_S5	Below are our current credit ratings.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	B With respect to the ratings issued by Moody s as noted above, Moody s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Ba1 Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	B2 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	B3 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The Prime-3 portion of the rating indicates issuer has an acceptable ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor s as noted above, Standard and Poor s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	B More vulnerable to adverse business, financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	BB+ Considered highest speculative grade by market participants.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	BB- Less vulnerable in the near-term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business, financial and economic conditions.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ( ASU 2014-08 ).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	The update changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhances convergence of the FASB s and International Accounting Standard Board s reporting requirements for discontinued operations.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	within the annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	We elected to early adopt ASU 2014-08, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	The update clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and creates a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12 ).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P105_S1	The update requires that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P105_S2	A reporting entity should apply guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P105_S3	The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-12 to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	The update provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items, ( ASU 2015-01 ).
1385280_15_ITEM7_P109_S1	ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P109_S2	As a result, an entity will no longer be required to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P109_S3	However, ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P109_S4	ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P109_S5	We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-01 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_15_ITEM7_P110_S3	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At December 31, 2014, there was an aggregate of approximately $236.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities, which excludes $450.0 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s term loan debt that is hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements as discussed below.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2014, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.4 million.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	All of our current interest rate swap agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Below is a summary of our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2014:
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2014:
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	(1) Includes $450.0 million of the Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan, which represents the debt currently hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreements.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P4_S3	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments.
1385280_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $36 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 by approximately $8 million, $7 million and $8 million, respectively.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of December 31, 2014, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1385280_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	and Procedures section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, with direct access to the Company s board of directors through its Audit Committee, have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	Their report on the consolidated financial statements is included in Part II, Item 8.

1385280_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	Limitations on Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or fraud.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.
1385280_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of Cinemark Holdings, Inc.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S1	Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P0_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P1_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P1_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_15_ITEM9B_P1_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P7_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P7_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P7_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P7_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P7_S4	Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P7_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P13_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) operates in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States ( U.S. ), Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Bolivia.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P13_S1	The Company operated theatres in Mexico until November 15, 2013 (see Note 5).
1385280_15_ITEM10_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P14_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P14_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P14_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P14_S4	Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating funds held in financial institutions, petty cash held by the theatres and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P15_S1	Cash investments were primarily in money market funds or other similar funds.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P16_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which are recorded at net realizable value, consists primarily of receivables related to screen advertising, receivables related to discounted tickets sold to retail locations, rebates earned from the Company s beverage and other concession vendors and value-added and other non-income tax receivables.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P17_S0	Inventories Concession and theatre supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P17_S1	Theatre Properties and Equipment Theatre properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P18_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
1385280_15_ITEM10_P19_S0	Lesser of lease term or useful life The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P19_S1	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P19_S2	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P20_S0	undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P20_S1	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods, for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee-owned properties.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P21_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P21_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P22_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P23_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P23_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2012, 2013 and 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P23_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P24_S0	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of theatre businesses acquired.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P24_S1	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P24_S2	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P24_S3	The Company considers the reporting unit to be each of its eighteen regions in the U.S. and each of its eight international regions (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_15_ITEM10_P25_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P25_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P26_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P26_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was seven and a half times for the evaluation performed during 2012 and eight times for the evaluations performed during 2013 and 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P26_S3	The Company increased the multiple of cash flows used for the evaluation performed during the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the increase in industry trading multiples, and the increase in the Company s stock price and resulting market capitalization.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P27_S0	Indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P28_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the Company s tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P28_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P30_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P31_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_15_ITEM10_P32_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P32_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from one to six years.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P33_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P33_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from one to twenty-one years.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P34_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement or the expected useful life of the intangible asset.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P34_S1	The remaining useful lives of these intangible assets range from one to twelve years.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P35_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of debt issue costs, long-term prepaid rents, construction related deposits, equipment to be placed in service, and other assets of a long-term nature.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P35_S1	Debt issue costs are amortized using the straight-line method (which approximates the effective interest method) over the primary financing terms of the related debt agreement.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P36_S0	Long-term prepaid rents represent prepayments of rent on operating leases.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P36_S1	These payments are recognized as facility lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P36_S2	The amortization periods generally range from one to ten years.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P37_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P37_S1	If substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership have been transferred to the Company as lessee, the Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P38_S0	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P39_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P39_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P39_S2	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P39_S3	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P39_S4	At the end of the construction period, the Company determines if the transaction qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment in regards to lease classification.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P39_S5	If the Company receives a lease incentive payment from a landlord, the Company records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the initial term of the respective lease.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P40_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P40_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P40_S2	Revenues related to these advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P41_S0	The Company is self-insured for general liability claims subject to an annual cap.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P41_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, claims were capped at $250, $250 and $100 per occurrence, respectively, with annual caps of approximately $2,650, $2,600 and $2,670, respectively.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S0	Company is also self-insured for medical claims up to $125 per occurrence.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S1	The Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company s insurance reserves were $7,376 and $7,675, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S3	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S6	The Company records proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S7	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S8	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S9	As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company s liabilities for advanced sale-type certificates were approximately $55,024 and $63,129, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P42_S10	The Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $9,093, $10,684 and $12,233 during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P43_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either mutually agreed upon firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final mutually agreed upon settlement, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P43_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a mutually agreed upon percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either a mutually agreed upon aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P44_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P44_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P45_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P45_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P45_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P45_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P46_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity award based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P46_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using a market observed price.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P47_S0	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_15_ITEM10_P47_S1	At the time of the grant, the Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P47_S2	See Note 16 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P48_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P48_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P48_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P49_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P49_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P50_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P51_S0	resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P52_S0	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P53_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P53_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P53_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_15_ITEM10_P54_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P55_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P56_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P56_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P56_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P57_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P57_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P57_S2	See Note 14 for a summary of the translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P58_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P59_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P60_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P60_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P60_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S0	The Company has interest rate swap agreements and investments in marketable securities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S1	With respect to its interest rate swap agreements, the Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S2	Therefore, the Company s fair value measurements for its interest rate swaps use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S3	With respect to its investments in marketable securities, the Company uses quoted market prices, which fall under Level 1 of the hierarchy.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S4	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 or 2014.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S5	See Note 12 for further discussion of the Company s interest rate swap agreements and Note 13 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S6	The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis, primarily in the impairment evaluations for goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P61_S7	See Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Theatre Properties and Equipment included above for discussion of such fair value measurements.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P62_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P62_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P62_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P63_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts realized.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P63_S1	The Company provides assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P63_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P63_S3	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P63_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P63_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methodologies utilized by the third party valuation firm.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P80_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P80_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCMI ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior ESA, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S4	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S5	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron, initially seven cents, and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for certain reasons outlined in the modified ESA.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S6	The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the first such increase taking effect after the end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P81_S7	For 2012, 2013 and 2014, the annual payment per digital screen was one thousand twenty-one dollars, one thousand seventy-two dollars and one thousand one hundred twenty-five dollars, respectively.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P82_S0	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P82_S1	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P82_S2	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 22 years.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P83_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P83_S1	Following the NCM, Inc. IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P83_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P83_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P83_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data Common Unit Adjustments Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCMI and the Company, AMC and Regal, which we refer to collectively as the Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, we follow the guidance in FASB ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S2	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S3	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S4	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P84_S7	Our Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P85_S0	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P85_S1	If the Company then elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Tranche 2 Investment at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P85_S2	Below is a summary of common units received by the Company under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014:
1385280_15_ITEM10_P85_S3	Each common unit received by the Company is convertible into one share of NCMI common stock.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P85_S4	The fair value of the common units received was estimated based on the market price of NCMI stock at the time that the common units were received, adjusted for volatility associated with the estimated period of time it would take to convert the common units and register the respective shares.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P85_S5	The fair value measurement used for the common units falls under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by ASC Topic 820-10-35.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P124_S1	Therefore, the Company s measurements use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P124_S2	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 3.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P131_S0	All foreign countries where the Company has operations are non-highly inflationary and the local currency is the same as the functional currency in all of the locations.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P131_S1	Thus, any fluctuation in the currency results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P131_S2	Below is a summary of the impact of translating the financial statements of the Company s international subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P136_S2	The shares of the Company s common stock are not subject to any redemption provisions.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P136_S3	The Company has no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P136_S4	The Company s ability to pay dividends is effectively limited by its status as a holding company and the terms of its subsidiary s indentures and amended senior secured credit facility, which also significantly restricts the ability of certain of the Company s subsidiaries to pay dividends directly or indirectly to the Company.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P136_S5	Furthermore, certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries currently have a deficit in retained earnings which prevents the Company from declaring and paying dividends from those subsidiaries.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P137_S0	Treasury Stock Treasury stock represents shares of common stock repurchased by the Company and not yet retired.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P145_S1	The restricted stock units vest based on a combination of financial performance factors and continued service.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P145_S2	The financial performance factors are based on an implied equity value concept that determines an internal rate of return ( IRR ) for a measurement period, as defined in the award agreement, based on a formula utilizing a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA subject to certain specified adjustments (as defined in the restricted stock unit award agreement).
1385280_15_ITEM10_P145_S3	The measurement period for the restricted stock unit awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 is a three year period and the measurement period for the restricted stock unit awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2014 is a two year period.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P145_S4	The financial performance factors for the restricted stock units have a threshold, target and maximum level of payment opportunity and vest on a prorata basis according to the IRR achieved by the Company during the performance period.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S0	least one-third of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S1	If the IRR for the defined measurement period is at least 10.5%, which is the target, at least two-thirds of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S2	If the IRR for the defined measurement period is at least 12.5%, which is the maximum, at least 100% of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S3	Further, as an example, if the Company achieves an IRR equal to 11.5%, the number of restricted stock units that shall vest will be greater than the target but less than the maximum number that would have vested had the Company achieved the highest IRR.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S4	All payouts of restricted stock units that vest will be subject to an additional service requirement and will be paid in the form of common stock if the participant continues to provide services through the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S5	At the time of each of the restricted stock unit grants, the Company assumes the IRR level to be reached for the defined measurement period will be the mid-point IRR level in determining the amount of compensation expense to record for such grants.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P146_S6	If and when additional information becomes available to indicate that something other than the mid-point IRR level will be achieved, the Company adjusts compensation expense on a prospective basis over the remaining service period.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P147_S0	The fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted during 2014 was determined based on the market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, which was $28.54 per share.

1385280_15_ITEM10_P148_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had restricted stock units outstanding that represented a total 573,584 hypothetical shares of common stock, net of actual cumulative forfeitures of 42,207 units, assuming the maximum IRR of at least 12.5% is achieved for all of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $4,803, which assumes the high-point IRR level will be achieved for the 2011 grants, an IRR of approximately 11.1% will be achieved for the 2012 grants and the mid-point IRR level will be achieved for the 2013 grants.
1385280_15_ITEM10_P148_S2	The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.

1385280_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we built 22 new theatres with 182 screens and acquired three theatres with 19 screens.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	We believe our portfolio of modern high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid and consistent cash flows from operating activities.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly considering the expanding worldwide box office.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P3_S4	We continue to develop and expand new platforms and market adaptive concepts for our theatre circuit, such as XD, Movie Bistro, Cinemark Reserve, Luxury Lounger reclining seats, D-BOX seating, Cin Arts and other premium concepts.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P3_S5	Our XD screens represent the largest private label premium large format footprint in the industry.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	including a Barco Auro 11.1 sound system or Dolby Atmos in select locations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	The XD experience includes wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	The exceptional XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in the XD auditorium without any print enhancements required.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2015, we had 210 XD auditoriums in our worldwide circuit with plans to install 15 to 20 more XD auditoriums during 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Movie Bistro locations offer in-theatre dining with expanded food offerings, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	We currently have three domestic theatres and one international theatre with the bistro concept and we plan to expand this premium concept to two new domestic locations during 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	During 2014, we opened our first Cinemark Reserve theatre in the U.S., which features a VIP area with luxury recliner seating and other amenities, along with a wide variety of food and beverage products.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	We opened our second Cinemark Reserve theatre in the U.S. during 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	We have a similar VIP concept offering recliner seating in five other domestic locations and in 22 of our international theatres, referred to locally as either Cinemark Premiere or Cinemark Prime.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S5	We plan to continue to incorporate this concept in four of our new domestic and international theatres and convert three of our existing locations during 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S6	We have incorporated Luxury Lounger reclining seats in the majority of our new domestic builds and have also repositioned some of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S7	We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 29 of our domestic theatres, representing 397 screens.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S8	We plan to offer the Luxury Loungers in approximately 20% of our domestic circuit by the end of 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S9	We currently have auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, called D-BOX.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P5_S10	These seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and makes the viewer feel as if they are part of the movie itself.

1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry began its conversion to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	This format enables us to more efficiently move titles between auditoriums within a theatre to appropriately address demand for each title.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S5	Currently, all of our first-run domestic and international theatres are fully digital.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S6	Digital projection allows us to present 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P6_S7	Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	According to Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, approximately 17% and 13% of domestic box office for 2013 and 2014, respectively, was generated by 3-D tickets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	During 2013, through a joint venture named Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, the motion picture exhibition industry developed a content delivery network that allows for delivery of all digital content to U.S. theatres via satellite.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	We have started to expand satellite delivery technology into some of our Latin American markets, initially for live event presentations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Approximately 59 of our international theatres have capabilities to receive live event feeds via satellite, with some of these locations also able to receive film content via satellite.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry set an all-time box office record during 2015 with an estimated $11.1 billion in revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	This represents an increase of approximately 7% over 2014 and an increase of 2% over box office revenues for the previous record set during 2013.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	The following table represents the results of a survey by MPAA published during March 2015, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2005 to 2014 (industry data for 2015 has not yet been released): Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2015 included Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II, Furious 7, American Sniper, 50 Shades of Grey , Inside Out , Minions , Spectre and Mission: Impossible 5, among other films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	And Where To Find Them , among other films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $26.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing a 4% increase over 2013.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	International box office growth is a result of strong economies, ticket price increases and new theatre construction.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, consistent with 2013 performance.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	Growth in Latin America continues to be fueled by a combination of growing populations, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), continued retail development, and quality product from Hollywood, including 3-D and alternative content offerings.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe many international markets will continue to experience growth as new theatre technologies and platforms are introduced, as film and other product offerings continue to expand and as ancillary revenue opportunities grow.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Drivers of Continued Industry Success We believe the following market trends will drive the continued strength of our industry: Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	A successful theatrical release brands a film and is one of the major contributors to a film s success in downstream markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, and network and syndicated television.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success .
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $26.0 billion, or approximately 72%, of 2014 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will become even more significant.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Many of the top U.S. films released during 2015 also performed exceptionally well in international markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S4	Such films included Furious 7 , which grossed approximately $1,162.0 million in international markets, or approximately 77% of its worldwide box office, Avengers: Age of Ultron , which grossed approximately $946.0 million in international markets, or approximately 67% of its worldwide box office, and Jurassic World , which grossed approximately $1,014.0 million in international markets, or approximately 61% of its worldwide box office.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S5	Over the past ten years, industry statistics have shown slight increases and decreases in attendance from one year to another, however domestic box office revenues have remained relatively stable during this period.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P14_S6	The industry has not experienced highly volatile results, even during recessionary periods, demonstrating the stability of the industry and its continued ability to attract consumers.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $8.17 in 2014.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Average prices in 2014 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $28.00 to $84.00 per ticket according to MPAA.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Innovation Using Digital and Satellite Technology.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our industry began converting to digital projection technology during 2009.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	Our domestic circuit also converted to satellite technology during 2014 and our international circuit has started to implement satellite technology as a means to receive film and other content.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Digital projection combined with satellite delivery allows exhibitors to expand their product offerings, including the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	Alternative entertainment may include pre-recorded programs as well as live sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P16_S5	New and enhanced programming alternatives expands the industry s offerings to attract a broader customer base.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Introduction of New Platforms and Product Offerings.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	The motion picture exhibition industry continues to develop new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences.

1385280_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Some locations now offer hot foods, adult beverages and/or healthier snack options for patrons.

1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S12	During 2015, we built 182 new screens worldwide.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S13	We currently have commitments to open 184 additional new screens over the next three years.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S14	We have installed digital projection technology in all of our worldwide auditoriums.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S15	Currently, approximately 55% of our U.S. screens and 65% of our international screens are 3-D compatible.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S16	We currently have 14 digital IMAX screens.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S17	As of December 31, 2015, we had the industry-leading private label premium large format circuit with 210 XD auditoriums in our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S18	We have plans to install 15 to 20 additional XD auditoriums during 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S19	We also continue to develop new market-adaptive theatre concepts in various markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S20	We believe we offer the brightest picture in the industry, with our Doremi servers and Barco digital projectors, and custom surround sound in our auditoriums.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S21	We have also established a centralized theatre support center that monitors and responds to projection performance and theatre network connectivity issues across our worldwide circuit on real-time basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S22	We continue to grow organically as well as through the acquisition of high-quality theatres in select markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S23	Our growth strategy has centered around achieving a target return on investment while also complementing our existing theatre circuit.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S24	We continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which demonstrates the success of our growth strategy.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P21_S25	We believe a combination of our strong balance sheet and our expected level of cash flows will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities, while also allowing us to efficiently service our debt obligations and continue to offer our stockholders a strong dividend yield under our current dividend policy.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Strategy We believe our disciplined operating philosophy and experienced operational management team will enable us to continue to enhance our leading position in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Key components of our strategy include: Focus on Operational Excellence and Customer Satisfaction.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	We continue to focus on achieving operational excellence by controlling theatre operating costs and training and motivating our staff all while focusing on making each of our customer s experiences memorable.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	We strive for first-rate customer service and focus on driving attendance.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P22_S4	Our consistent industry-leading margins reflect our ability to deliver the highest quality presentation to our patrons while also managing changes in product and consumer preferences.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Growth in Existing and New Markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	We continue to seek growth opportunities by building or acquiring high-quality theatres that meet our strategic, financial and demographic criteria.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	We added 25 new theatres with 201 screens to our worldwide circuit during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	We also monitor economic and market trends to ensure our existing theatres offer a broad range of products, prices and platforms that satisfy our patrons and to develop new concepts to adapt to changes in preferences.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S4	During 2014, we acquired one theatre in Alabama, a new state for us and we opened our first theatre in Bolivia.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S5	During 2015, we opened our first theatre in Curacao, adding another new country to our diverse circuit.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P23_S6	We have plans to open a theatre in Paraguay, another new country, in 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Commitment to Technological and Product Innovation.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our commitment to technological innovation has resulted in us being 100% digital in our worldwide circuit as of December 31, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	In the U.S., 100% of our projectors are networked with satellite infrastructure and our Latin American theatres will be 100% capable by the end of 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	We continue to expand our worldwide XD auditorium footprint.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S4	We are also committed to developing and expanding our new market-adaptive theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S5	With our technological innovations, we have broadened the range of entertainment options offered at our theatres by expanding content to include concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S6	Approximately 57% of our worldwide screens are 3-D compatible.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S7	We are also committed to developing and expanding our market-adaptive concepts.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P24_S8	Our concession and food offerings are progressing to selectively include upscale options, hot prepared food, offerings tailored to local demographics, alcoholic beverages, and healthy snack alternatives in addition to our more standard concession products.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Theatre amenities we provide to our customers may include our private-label premium large format XD screens, Luxury Lounger reclining seats, VIP lounge areas, reserved seating, and seats with cinematic motion.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	While we continue to grow our theatre circuit with new builds and acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our existing theatres to ensure they provide our customers with a comfortable, high-quality entertainment experience.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	We spent approximately $140 million and $199 million on capital expenditures for existing theatres during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P25_S3	Our efforts during 2015 included remodeling some of our existing theatres to include reclining seats and expanded concession offerings, the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX and routine improvements to ensure our theatres offer the highest quality guest experience.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Theatre Operations As of December 31, 2015, we operated 513 theatres and 5,796 screens in 41 U.S. states and 14 Latin American countries.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	The following tables summarize the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	(1) Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Chile in 1993.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed the most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the region.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor, with 568 and 179 screens, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S5	We intend to continue to build and expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S6	We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by transacting local operating expenses primarily in their respective local currencies.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S7	Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent local currency revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S8	We offer a variety of content at our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S9	We monitor upcoming films and related events and work with film distributors to license the content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S10	We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S11	We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in select locations, we also offer a D-BOX format.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S12	The D-BOX format features moving seats and added sensory features in addition to the ultra-realistic images of 3-D technology.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S13	We also regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our patrons.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S14	Bringing art and independent films to our theatres allows us to benefit from the growth in the art and independent market driven by the increased interest in art, foreign and documentary films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S15	We have also established a Classic Series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies that change on a weekly basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P28_S16	The program covers many genres of classic films that are generally exhibited during non-peak times.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	During December 2013, we formed a joint venture, named AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, which then purchased the Fathom event business from National CineMedia, LLC.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Fathom event business generally focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres feature film schedules.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	AC JV, LLC will continue to bring alternative events to our theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera, sports programs, concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	We, along with AC JV, LLC, continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide entertainment to consumers.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	We are responsible for booking the films in film licensing zones, which are either free film licensing zones or competitive film licensing zones.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	In free film licensing zones, movies can be booked without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors within that area.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	In competitive film licensing zones, the distributor allocates its movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S5	We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at approximately 93% of our domestic theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S6	We face competition from other exhibitors and other forms of entertainment, as discussed under Competition below, in both our free and competitive film licensing zones.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P32_S7	In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	In the international marketplace, films are not allocated based on film licensing zones, but played by competitive theatres simultaneously.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our patrons, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a film s box office receipts at each of our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a firm terms formula under which we pay a negotiated rate as determined prior to a film s run; a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film s run; or a rate that is negotiated after a film s run.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Food and Beverage Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 33% of total revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	We have devoted considerable management effort to increasing concession sales by expanding our offerings and adapting to our customers changing preferences, as discussed below.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Common concession products offered at all of our theatres include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juice blends, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Other varieties and flavors of candy, snacks and drinks are offered at theatres based on preferences in that particular market.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	We have recently introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our patrons, which are available at some locations, and also offer a variety of alcoholic beverages in some locations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S3	Through our Movie Bistro, Cinemark Reserve and Cinemark Premier concepts, we have expanded concession product offerings to include more food and drink options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S4	We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in certain domestic and international theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S5	Our point of sale system allows us to monitor product sales and make changes to product mix when necessary, which also allows us to quickly take advantage of national as well as regional product launches and promotions.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S6	New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchases as well as to attract new buyers.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P35_S7	We offer specially-priced product combinations at many of our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	periodically offer discounts to our patrons on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discounted price.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	In certain international countries, we offer a loyalty benefit program to frequent patrons.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Consumer promotions usually include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving patrons in an expedited manner.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	We have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices, impulse purchases and superior visibility of concession items.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	In some of our international locations, we allow patrons to pre-order concession items, either online or at a kiosk, and pick them up in a dedicated line at the concession counter.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and negotiate rebates.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Concession supplies are generally distributed through a distribution network.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	The concession distributor delivers inventory to the theatres, which place orders directly with the vendors to replenish stock.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	We conduct a weekly inventory of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our customers.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Pre-Feature Screen Advertising In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P42_S3	We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen advertising revenue on a per patron basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P42_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we had an approximate 19% ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P42_S5	See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	In our international markets, during 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, began handling all of our screen advertising functions in Brazil.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our Brazil theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to another exhibitor in Brazil through a revenue share agreement.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	In Argentina, we also have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our Argentina theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	We recently acquired an advertising business in Chile, which we will also integrate with our Flix Media division.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	In our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S6	The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S7	In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S8	We will continue to expand Flix Media into our other international locations over the next few years.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P43_S9	In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Media s services to include, among other things, alternative content, online ticketing, and loyalty initiatives.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry has undertaken certain technology initiatives over the past few years, as discussed below.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition Through the joint venture DCDC with Regal, AMC, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and Universal Pictures, we began delivering digital content to domestic theatres via satellite during October 2013.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	As of December 31, 2015, 100% of our domestic auditoriums were capable of receiving content via satellite.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	The satellite delivery system established by DCDC is available to all exhibitors and content providers and allows live and store-and-forward content to be delivered to our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	The industry is beginning to expand satellite delivery technology to certain Latin American markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S5	Currently, 59 of our international theatres have the ability to receive live events via satellite, with some of these also able to receive film content via satellite.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P45_S6	During 2016, we plan to install the necessary equipment in all of our international theatres to allow them to receive content via satellite.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Marketing We generally market our theatres and events using Internet advertising and newspaper directory film schedules.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	Radio and television advertising spots are also used to promote certain motion pictures and special events, such as theatre grand openings and VIP events.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	We offer patrons access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Customers can subscribe to our weekly emails to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P47_S3	We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P47_S4	These programs may involve customer contests, cross-promotions with the media and third parties and other means to increase patronage for a particular film showing at our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	CineMode, which is a function within the app we developed, allows patrons the opportunity to earn rewards while being courteous during a show.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our innovative technology was designed to address texting and other cell phone distractions, which is the number one complaint of movie-goers.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	While in CineMode, the phone s screen is automatically dimmed and patrons are prompted to silence their volume.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	If CineMode is enabled for the duration of the movie, patrons are rewarded with exclusive digital rewards and offers that can be used at their next visit to Cinemark.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	CineMode connects us with our patrons and provides an opportunity for us to further expand our relationships with the studios and our vendors through promotions.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S5	We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S6	Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S7	We generally market these programs to businesses as an employee-incentive or rewards program.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P48_S8	Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Competition We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting patrons, licensing films and developing new theatre sites.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal, AMC and Carmike Cinemas, Inc. and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cin polis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), and Araujo.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at approximately 93% of our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	In competitive film licensing zones, the distributor allocates its movies generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	In all theatres, our success in attracting patrons depends on location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, and ticket prices.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue and patron potential, and financial stability.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P50_S5	We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	Corporate Operations Our worldwide headquarters is located in Plano, Texas.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, including our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax, audit and information technology.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our U.S. operations are divided into nineteen regions, each of which is headed by a region leader.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have eight regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fourteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are operated out of one Central American regional office).
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Each regional office is headed by a general manager with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and accounting.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	We have chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina, which are our two largest international markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	Employees We have approximately 19,300 employees in the U.S., approximately 19% of whom are full time employees and 81% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S5	We have approximately 9,000 employees in our international markets, approximately 37% of whom are full time employees and approximately 63% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S6	Due to the seasonal nature of our business as discussed above, our headcount can vary throughout the year, depending on the timing and success of movie releases.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S7	Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P53_S8	We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors is subject to consent decrees resulting from these cases.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	We currently have operations in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Curacao which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business depends on film production and performance.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	Poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P56_S4	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	The unexpected emergence of a successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S4	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S5	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P57_S6	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with six major film distributors accounting for approximately 84.4% of U.S. box office revenues and 46 of the top 50 grossing films during 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from the antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P61_S3	In markets where we do not face competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P61_S4	The competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, products and amenities offered, and ticket prices.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P61_S5	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	An increase in the use of alternative film distribution channels or other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S4	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S5	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video and digital release windows.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S6	Over the last decade, the average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P62_S7	If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Film studios occasionally offer consumers a premium video on-demand option for certain films shortly after the theatrical release.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	These release windows, which are determined by the studios, may shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S5	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S6	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S7	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S8	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S9	We have 176 theatres with 1,278 screens in fourteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P63_S10	Brazil represented approximately 10.2% of our consolidated 2015 revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P64_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and cash transfers to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we had $1,814.6 million in long-term debt obligations, $227.7 million in capital lease obligations and $1,699.9 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S3	We may not be able to continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S4	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S5	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S6	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S7	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S8	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S9	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S10	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S11	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S12	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S13	As of December 31, 2015, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 19%.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P66_S14	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	respectively, and $18.5 million and $18.1 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S4	While we continue to implement the latest technological innovations, such as 3-D, D-BOX and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S5	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S6	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S7	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S8	We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S9	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S10	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S11	The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S12	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P68_S13	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	We may not be able to obtain such financing or ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	If we do not comply with the ADA and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P69_S4	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P69_S5	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	On November 15, 2004, Cinemark and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P70_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P70_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	We may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	In the U.S., we are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P72_S5	We are also subject to union regulations in certain of our international markets, which can specify wage rates as well as minimum hours to be paid to certain employees.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	As union wage rates and other requirements change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	We have a significant amount of long-lived assets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, therefore if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	We also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P74_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative analysis on our goodwill and tradename intangible assets and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are below their respective carrying values.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P76_S4	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P78_S3	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	Certain provisions of our 4.875% senior notes indenture, our 5.125% senior notes indenture, our 7.375% senior subordinated notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 4.875% senior notes, our 5.125% senior notes, and our 7.375% senior subordinated notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	A change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S4	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S5	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S6	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S7	As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of 178,561,563 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S8	In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S9	We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S10	As of December 31, 2015, we had 115,924,059 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S11	Of these shares, approximately 104,622,631 shares were freely tradable.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S12	The remaining shares of our Common Stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P79_S13	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2015, there were 7,361,757 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S4	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S5	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S6	Cyber security threats and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S7	We store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information of our customers and employees.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S8	Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S9	While we have adopted industry-accepted security measures and technology to protect the confidential and proprietary information, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S10	As such, we may be unable to anticipate and implement adequate preventive measures in time.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S11	This may adversely affect our business, including exposure to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S12	In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or attacks, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by breaches affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S13	Product recalls and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S14	We are resellers of food and we may be liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S15	We are also subject to recall by product manufacturers or if the food products become contaminated.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S16	Recalls could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of the product and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S17	Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S18	Our cinemas rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S19	Any expansion on existing and/or new laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation or data protection could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to our marketing strategy which could adversely impact our attendance levels and revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S20	We are subject to complex taxation and could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S21	We are subject to many different forms of taxation both in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P81_S22	The tax authorities may not agree with the determinations that we made and such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts for tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material impact on our results.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	Additionally, current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
1385280_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	If the Company s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company s taxes owed in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

1385280_16_ITEM2_P2_S7	See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our minimum lease commitments.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P2_S8	We periodically review the profitability of each of our theatres, particularly those whose lease terms are nearing expiration, to determine whether to continue its operations.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	Legal Proceedings Joseph Amey, et al. v. Cinemark USA, Inc. , Case No. 3:13cv05669, In the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division .
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S1	The case presents putative class action claims for damages and attorney s fees arising from employee wage and hour claims under California law for alleged meal period, rest break, reporting time pay, unpaid wages, pay upon termination, and wage statements violations.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S2	The claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney General Act ( PAGA ).
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S3	We deny the claims, deny that class certification is appropriate and deny that a PAGA representative action is appropriate, and are vigorously defending against the claims.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S4	We deny any violation of law and plan to vigorously defend against all claims.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S5	The Court recently determined that class certification is not appropriate and determined that a PAGA representative action is not appropriate.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P3_S6	The plaintiff may appeal these rulings.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	We are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	We received a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P5_S1	The CID relates to an investigation under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P5_S2	We also received CIDs from the Antitrust Section of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ohio and later from other states regarding similar inquiries under state antitrust laws.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P6_S0	The CIDs request us to answer interrogatories, and produce documents, or both, related to the investigation of matters including film clearances, potential coordination and/or communication with other major theatre circuits and related joint ventures.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P6_S1	We intend to fully cooperate with all federal and state government agencies.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P6_S2	Although we do not believe that we have violated any federal or state antitrust or competition laws, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P6_S3	From time to time, we are involved in other various legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business operations, such as personal injury claims, employment matters, landlord-tenant disputes, patent claims and contractual disputes, some of which are covered by insurance or by indemnification from vendors.
1385280_16_ITEM2_P6_S4	We believe our potential liability, with respect to these types of proceedings currently pending, is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	and low sales prices per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the years indicated.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of Common Stock As of December 31, 2015, there were 457 holders of record of the Company s common stock and there were no other classes of stock issued and outstanding.

1385280_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	During May 2013, we acquired 32 theatres with 483 screens in the U.S.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P6_S2	The results of operations for these theatres are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the dates of the respective acquisitions.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	During November 2013, we sold our Mexico theatres, which included 31 theatres and 290 screens.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	You should read the selected consolidated financial and operating data set forth below in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P9_S0	(1) For the purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income from continuing operations before taxes plus fixed charges excluding capitalized interest.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P9_S1	Fixed charges consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of debt issue costs and that portion of rental expense which we believe to be representative of the interest factor.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P10_S0	(2) Effective December 31, 2015, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ), which resulted in the presentation of debt issuance costs as a contra-account to the related debt instruments.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P10_S1	The revised presentation was applied for all periods presented.
1385280_16_ITEM5_P10_S2	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	statements and accompanying notes included in this report.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia and Curacao.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	We operated theatres in Mexico until November 15, 2013.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Revenues and Expenses We generate revenues primarily from box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources such as digital video monitor advertising.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our recently formed joint venture, AC JV, LLC.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our Flix Media initiative has allowed us to expand our screen advertising within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2015 included Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part II, Furious 7, American Sniper, 50 Shades of Grey , Inside Out , Minions , Spectre and Mission: Impossible 5, among other films.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	And Where To Find Them , among other films.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Film rental costs can also vary based on the length of a film s run.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Film rental rates are generally negotiated on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level as daily movie directories placed in newspapers represent the largest component of advertising costs.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	The monthly cost of these advertisements is based on, among other things, the size of the directory and the frequency and size of the newspaper s circulation.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily includes utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P9_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S7	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P13_S8	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee owned properties.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2013, 2014 and 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P22_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and seven countries internationally (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2013 and 2014, requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2013 and 2014.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our goodwill exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, our estimated future performance, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	During 2013 and 2014, we estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The qualitative assessment included consideration of our historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P43_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Recent Developments On February 16, 2016, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors approved the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement of Mark Zoradi, to be effective February 19, 2016 (the Amended Agreement ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Amended Agreement amends Section 3.2(c) by providing that the Equity Awards (as defined in the Amended Agreement) shall be at least 200% of Mr. Zoradi s base salary and providing for an additional amount for personal expenses.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	The amendments conform the Amended Agreement to the terms of Mr. Zoradi s employment offer in August 2015.

1385280_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	The $74.1 million increase in concession revenues was primarily attributable to the 3.3% increase in attendance and an 8.2% increase in concession revenues per patron, which increased from $3.65 for 2014 to $3.95 for 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales and price increases.

1385280_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	The $4.1 million increase in admissions revenues was primarily attributable to an 11.7% increase in attendance, partially offset by a 9.6% decrease in average ticket price, which declined from $4.70 for 2014 to $4.25 for 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The $ 17.5 million increase in concession revenues was primarily attributable to the 11.7% increase in attendance, partially offset by a 3.0% decrease in concession revenues per patron from $2.33 for 2014 to $2.26 for 2015.

1385280_16_ITEM7_P67_S10	The decrease was primarily due to the issuance of the 4.875% Senior Notes on May 24, 2013 that were used to pay off, on June 24, 2013, the previously issued 8.625% Senior Notes.

1385280_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Ratings We are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency s evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P97_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P97_S4	A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P97_S5	Below are our current credit ratings.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	B+ With respect to the ratings issued by Moody s as noted above, Moody s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Ba1 Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	B2 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	B3 Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	The Prime-3 portion of the rating indicates issuer has an acceptable ability to repay short-term debt.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor s as noted above, Standard and Poor s defines these ratings as follows:
1385280_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	BBB An obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	B An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB , but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items , ( ASU 2015-01 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	With this update, there is no longer a need to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or disclose income taxes and earnings per share data applicable to an extraordinary item.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	However, presentation and disclosure requirements for items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently still apply.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-01, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , ( ASU 2015-02 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P109_S3	ASU 2015-02 also provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-02 on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	The update changes the presentation of debt issuance costs for term debt in the balance sheet by requiring the debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than recorded as an asset.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P111_S2	This guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods applied retrospectively.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P111_S3	We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt, net of accumulated amortization, were $31.4 million and $33.2 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	The balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 has been recast to reflect the reclassification of debt issuances costs, net of accumulated amortization, from deferred charges and other assets net to a reduction of long-term debt, less current portion.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement , ( ASU 2015-05 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S3	If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S4	The guidance will not change GAAP for a customer s accounting for service contracts.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S5	In addition, the guidance in this Update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P113_S6	Consequently, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	ASU 2015-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	We have elected to early adopt ASU 2015-05, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , ( ASU 2015-11 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	ASU 2015-11 affects reporting entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	Specifically, ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P115_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P115_S4	Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	We do not expect ASU 2015-11 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , ( ASU 2015-14 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014-09).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P118_S3	Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements , ( ASU 2015-15 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	ASU 2015-15 adds clarification to the guidance presented in ASU 2015-03, as that guidance did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	We adopted this ASU along with the original guidance in ASU 2015-03 discussed above.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P120_S3	The guidance in this ASU did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , ( ASU 2015-16 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	ASU 2015-16 was issued to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P121_S2	ASU 2015-16 requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, amounts recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P121_S3	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P121_S4	The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P121_S5	We do not expect ASU 2015-16 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , ( ASU 2015-17 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	ASU 2015-17 was issued to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S2	ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S3	However, the requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S4	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S5	Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S6	The amendments in ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S7	We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and elected the prospective approach.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S8	Therefore, deferred taxes as of December 31, 2015 are recorded as long-term deferred tax assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P122_S9	Balances as of December 31, 2014 have not been recast.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , ( ASU 2016-01 ).
1385280_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	ASU 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P123_S2	The guidance in ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P123_S3	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements of fiscal years that have not been previously issued.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P125_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P125_S3	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	We have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	At December 31, 2015, there was an aggregate of approximately $579.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities, which excludes $100.0 million of Cinemark USA, Inc. s term loan debt that is hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreement discussed below.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2015, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $5.8 million.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	Our interest rate swap agreement qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	The fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swap s gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P128_S3	Below is a summary of our interest rate swap agreement as of December 31, 2015:
1385280_16_ITEM7_P128_S4	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2015:
1385280_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	(1) Includes $100.0 million of the Cinemark USA, Inc. term loan, which represents the debt currently hedged with the Company s interest rate swap agreement.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	(2) Amounts are presented before adjusting for debt issuance costs.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P132_S2	U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_16_ITEM7_P132_S3	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary.

1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors of Cinemark Holdings, Inc.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S1	Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P0_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P1_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_16_ITEM9B_P1_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P6_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P13_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) operates in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States ( U.S. ), Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia and Cura ao.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P13_S1	The Company operated theatres in Mexico until November 15, 2013 (see Note 5).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P14_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P14_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P14_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P14_S4	Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating funds held in financial institutions, petty cash held by the theatres and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P15_S1	Cash investments were primarily in money market funds or other similar funds.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P16_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which are recorded at net realizable value, consists primarily of receivables related to screen advertising, receivables related to discounted tickets sold to retail locations, receivables from landlords related to theatre construction, rebates earned from the Company s beverage and other concession vendors and value-added and other non-income tax receivables.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P17_S0	Inventories Concession and theatre supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P17_S1	Theatre Properties and Equipment Theatre properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P18_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
1385280_16_ITEM10_P19_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P20_S0	competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P21_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P21_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P21_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods, for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee-owned properties.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P22_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P22_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P23_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P24_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P24_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2013, 2014 and 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P24_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P24_S3	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P24_S4	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P24_S5	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and seven countries internationally (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala are considered one reporting unit).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P25_S0	Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2013 and 2014, requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P25_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2013 and 2014.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company s goodwill exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S5	The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P26_S6	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P27_S0	The Company performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P27_S1	The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P28_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P29_S0	2013 and 2014, the Company estimated the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P29_S1	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P30_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P31_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company s tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P31_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P31_S3	The qualitative assessment included consideration of the Company s historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P31_S4	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P31_S5	The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_16_ITEM10_P32_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P32_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from two to five years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P33_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P33_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from approximately three to twenty-one years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P34_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement or the expected useful life of the intangible asset.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P34_S1	The remaining useful lives of these intangible assets range from two to eleven years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P35_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of long-term prepaid rents, construction and other deposits, equipment to be placed in service, and other assets of a long-term nature.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P35_S1	Long-term prepaid rents represent prepayments of rent on operating leases.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P35_S2	These payments are recognized as facility lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P35_S3	The amortization periods generally range from one to ten years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P36_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P36_S1	The Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception if 1) the present value of future minimum lease payments exceeds 90% of the leased property s estimated fair value; 2) the lease term exceeds 75% of the property s estimated useful life; 3) the lease contains a bargain purchase option; or 4) ownership transfers to the Company at the end of the lease.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P36_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P37_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P37_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P37_S2	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P37_S3	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P38_S0	If the Company receives a lease incentive payment from a landlord, the Company records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the initial term of the respective lease.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P39_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P39_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P39_S2	These advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S0	The Company is self-insured for general liability claims subject to an annual cap.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, claims were capped at $250, $100 and $100 per occurrence, respectively, with annual caps of approximately $2,600, $2,670 and $2,900, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S2	The Company is also self-insured for medical claims up to $125 per occurrence.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S3	The Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S4	As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company s insurance reserves were $7,675 and $9,039, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S5	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S6	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S7	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S8	The Company records proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S9	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P40_S10	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company s liabilities for advanced sale-type certificates were approximately $63,209 and $68,158, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P41_S1	The Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $10,684, $12,233 and $11,786 during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P42_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P42_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P43_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P43_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P44_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P44_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P44_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P44_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P45_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity award based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P45_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using a market observed price.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P46_S0	employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P46_S1	At the time of the grant, the Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P46_S2	See Note 16 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P47_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P47_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P47_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P48_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P48_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P49_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P49_S1	The first step is recognition: The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P49_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P50_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P50_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P50_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P51_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P52_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P53_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P53_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P53_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P54_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P54_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P54_S2	See Note 14 for a summary of the translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P55_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P56_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P57_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P57_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P57_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P58_S0	adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S0	With respect to its interest rate swap agreements, the Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under these agreements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S1	Therefore, the Company s fair value measurements for its interest rate swaps use significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S2	With respect to its investments in marketable securities, the Company uses quoted market prices, which fall under Level 1 of the hierarchy.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S3	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S4	See Note 12 for further discussion of the Company s interest rate swap agreements and Note 13 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S5	The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis, primarily in the impairment evaluations for goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P59_S6	See Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Theatre Properties and Equipment included above for discussion of such fair value measurements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P60_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P60_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P60_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P61_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts realized.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P61_S1	The Company provides assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P61_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P61_S3	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P61_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P61_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methodologies utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P62_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items , ( ASU 2015-01 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P63_S0	ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P63_S1	With this update, there is no longer a need to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or disclose income taxes and earnings per share data applicable to an extraordinary item.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P63_S2	However, presentation and disclosure requirements for items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently still apply.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P64_S0	ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P64_S1	The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-01, which had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P65_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, ( ASU 2015-02 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P65_S1	ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P65_S2	Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P66_S0	are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P67_S0	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P67_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P68_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P68_S1	The update changes the presentation of debt issuance costs for term debt in the balance sheet by requiring the debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability, rather than recorded as an asset.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P68_S2	This guidance is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods applied retrospectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P68_S3	The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P69_S0	Debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt, net of accumulated amortization, were $31,419 and $33,237 as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P69_S1	The balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 has been recast to reflect the reclassification of debt issuances costs, net of accumulated amortization, from deferred charges and other assets net to a reduction of long-term debt, less current portion.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement , ( ASU 2015-05 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S1	ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S2	If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S3	If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S4	The guidance will not change GAAP for a customer s accounting for service contracts.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S5	In addition, the guidance in this Update supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P70_S6	Consequently, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P71_S0	ASU 2015-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P71_S1	The Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-05, which had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P72_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , ( ASU 2015-11 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P72_S1	ASU 2015-11 affects reporting entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P72_S2	Specifically, ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P72_S3	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P72_S4	Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P73_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P73_S1	The Company does not expect ASU 2015-11 to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P74_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, ( ASU 2015-14 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P74_S1	ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , ( ASU 2014-09).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P74_S2	The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P74_S3	Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P75_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P76_S0	Credit Arrangements , ( ASU 2015-15 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P76_S1	ASU 2015-15 adds clarification to the guidance presented in ASU 2015-03, as that guidance did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P76_S2	The Company adopted this ASU along with the original guidance in ASU 2015-03 discussed above.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P76_S3	The guidance in this ASU did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P77_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , ( ASU 2015-16 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P77_S1	ASU 2015-16 was issued to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P77_S2	ASU 2015-16 requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, amounts recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P77_S3	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P77_S4	The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P77_S5	The Company does not expect ASU 2015-16 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , ( ASU 2015-17 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S1	ASU 2015-17 was issued to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S2	ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S3	However, the requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S4	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S5	Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S6	The amendments in ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S7	The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and elected the prospective approach.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S8	Therefore, deferred taxes as of December 31, 2015 are recorded as long-term deferred tax assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P78_S9	Balances as of December 31, 2014 have not been recast.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P79_S0	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , ( ASU 2016-01 ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P79_S1	ASU 2016-01 address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P79_S2	The guidance in ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P79_S3	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements of fiscal years that have not been previously issued.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P80_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P81_S0	The Company considers its unvested share based payment awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities, and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P89_S0	LLC The Company has an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P89_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P89_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P90_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCMI ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P90_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P90_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior ESA, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P90_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P90_S4	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P90_S5	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron, initially seven cents, and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for certain reasons outlined in the modified ESA.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P91_S0	end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P91_S1	For 2013, 2014 and 2015, the annual payment per digital screen was one thousand seventy-two dollars, one thousand one hundred twenty-five dollars and one thousand one hundred eight-two dollars, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P92_S0	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P92_S1	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P92_S2	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 21 years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P93_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P93_S1	Following the NCMI IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P93_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P93_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P93_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S0	Common Unit Adjustments Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCMI and the Company, AMC and Regal, which we refer to collectively as the Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, we follow the guidance in FASB ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S2	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S3	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S4	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P94_S7	Our Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P95_S0	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P96_S0	equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P96_S1	Below is a summary of common units received by the Company under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015:
1385280_16_ITEM10_P96_S2	Each common unit received by the Company is convertible into one share of NCMI common stock.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P96_S3	The fair value of the common units received was estimated based on the market price of NCMI stock at the time that the common units were received, adjusted for volatility associated with the estimated period of time it would take to convert the common units and register the respective shares.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P96_S4	The fair value measurement used for the common units falls under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by ASC Topic 820-10-35.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P96_S5	The Company records additional common units it receives as part of its Tranche 2 Investment at estimated fair value with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P148_S0	During August 2013, the Company purchased the 49.9% noncontrolling interest share of one of its Brazilian subsidiaries, Adamark Cinemas S.A. ( Adamark ), for approximately $5,621 in cash.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P148_S1	Adamark had investments in two of the Company s Brazilian theatres.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P148_S2	The increase in the Company s ownership interest in the Brazilian subsidiary was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-45-23.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P148_S3	The Company recorded a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of approximately $4,618, which represented the difference between the cash paid and the book value of the Brazilian subsidiary s noncontrolling interest account.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P148_S4	As a result of this transaction, the Company owns 100% of the shares in Adamark.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P148_S5	Below is a summary of the impact of changes in the Company s ownership interest in its subsidiaries on its equity:
1385280_16_ITEM10_P149_S0	Common Stock Common stockholders are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P149_S1	Subject to the rights of holders of any then outstanding shares of the Company s preferred stock, the Company s common stockholders are entitled to any dividends that may be declared by the board of directors.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P156_S3	Below is a summary of restricted stock award activity recorded for the periods indicated:
1385280_16_ITEM10_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these restricted stock awards was approximately $11,944.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P157_S1	The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S0	Restricted Stock Units During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Company granted restricted stock units representing 115,107, 197,515 and 142,917 hypothetical shares of common stock, respectively, to employees.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S1	The restricted stock units vest based on a combination of financial performance factors and continued service.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S2	The financial performance factors are based on an implied equity value concept that determines an internal rate of return ( IRR ) for a measurement period, as defined in the award agreement, based on a formula utilizing a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA subject to certain specified adjustments (as defined in the restricted stock unit award agreement).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S3	The measurement period for the restricted stock unit awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2013 is a three year period and the measurement period for the restricted stock unit awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 is a two year period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S4	The financial performance factors for the restricted stock units have a threshold, target and maximum level of payment opportunity and vest on a prorata basis according to the IRR achieved by the Company during the performance period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S5	If the IRR for the defined measurement period is at least 8.5% (7.5% for the 2015 grant), which is the threshold, at least one-third of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P158_S6	If the IRR for the defined measurement period is at least 10.5% (9.5% for the 2015 grant), which is the target, at least two-thirds of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S0	the maximum, 100% of the restricted stock units vest.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S1	Further, as an example, if the Company achieves an IRR equal to 11.0%, the number of restricted stock units that shall vest will be greater than the target but less than the maximum number that would have vested had the Company achieved the highest IRR.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S2	All payouts of restricted stock units that vest will be subject to an additional service requirement and will be paid in the form of common stock if the participant continues to provide services through the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S3	At the time of each of the restricted stock unit grants, the Company assumes the IRR level to be reached for the defined measurement period will be the mid-point IRR level in determining the amount of compensation expense to record for such grants.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S4	If and when additional information becomes available to indicate that something other than the mid-point IRR level will be achieved, the Company adjusts compensation expense on a prospective basis over the remaining service period.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S5	The Company assumed forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 5% for the restricted stock unit awards granted during 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P159_S6	Restricted stock unit award participants are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments if and at the time the restricted stock unit awards vest.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P160_S0	Below is a summary of activity for restricted stock unit awards for the periods indicated: During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a modification to each of the 2013 and 2014 restricted stock unit grants.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P160_S1	The modifications resulted in a cap on the foreign currency exchange rate devaluation impact to be used in calculating the IRR for the respective measurement periods.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P160_S2	The Company revalued each of the grants based on the Company s stock price at the date of modification, which was $33.02.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P160_S3	The modifications resulted in incremental compensation expense of approximately $2,460 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had restricted stock units outstanding that represented a total 544,076 hypothetical shares of common stock, net of actual cumulative forfeitures of 22,985 units, assuming the maximum IRR is achieved for all of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data As of December 31, 2015, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $6,600, which reflects an IRR level of 11.1% that was achieved for the 2012 grants, an IRR level of 12.5% that was achieved for the 2013 and 2014 grants and an IRR level of 9.5% that is estimated to be achieved for the 2015 grant.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P162_S1	The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P166_S0	A reconciliation between income tax expense and taxes computed by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes follows: The Company reinvests the undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries with the exception of its subsidiary in Ecuador.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P166_S1	Accordingly, deferred U.S. federal and state income taxes are provided only on the undistributed earnings of the Company s subsidiary in Ecuador.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P166_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $316,000 of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, as it is the Company s policy to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in non-U.S. operations.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P166_S3	However, the Company may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional U.S. tax liability.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P166_S4	Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P167_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data Deferred Income Taxes The tax effects of significant temporary differences and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards comprising the net long-term deferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 consisted of the following: The Company s foreign tax credit carryforwards began to expire 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P167_S1	Some foreign net operating losses will expire in the next reporting period; however, some losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P167_S2	State net operating losses may be carried forward for periods of between five and twenty years with the last expiring year being 2035.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P168_S0	During November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P168_S1	ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as long-term on the balance sheet.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P168_S2	The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 effective December 31, 2015, on a prospective basis.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P168_S3	Adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in a reclassification of the Company s net current deferred tax asset to the net long-term deferred tax asset on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P168_S4	Balances as of December 31, 2014 have not been recast.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P170_S1	Of these amounts, $15,693 and $17,008 represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P170_S2	The Company had $2,500 and $3,198 accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P171_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P171_S1	The Company believes that its accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P171_S2	This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P171_S3	The Company is no longer subject to income tax audits from the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2012.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P171_S4	The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major state jurisdictions for years before 2011.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P172_S1	In addition to the minimum annual lease payments, some of the leases provide for contingent rentals based on operating results of the theatre and most require the payment of taxes, insurance and other costs applicable to the property.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P172_S2	The Company can renew, at its option, a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then market rental rates for various periods.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P172_S3	Some leases also provide for escalating rent payments throughout the lease term.

1385280_16_ITEM10_P176_S1	The case presents putative class action claims for damages and attorney s fees arising from employee wage and hour claims under California law for alleged meal period, rest break, reporting time pay, unpaid wages, pay upon termination, and wage statements violations.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P176_S2	The claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney General Act ( PAGA ).
1385280_16_ITEM10_P176_S3	The Company denies the claims, denies that class certification is appropriate and denies that a PAGA representative action is appropriate, and is vigorously defending against the claims.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P176_S4	The Company denies any violation of law and plans to vigorously defend against all claims.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P176_S5	The Court recently determined that class certification is not appropriate and determined that a PAGA representative action is not appropriate.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P176_S6	The plaintiff may appeal these rulings.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P177_S0	The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S0	The Company received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S1	The CID relates to an investigation under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S2	The Company also received CIDs from the Antitrust Section of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ohio and later from other states regarding similar inquiries under state antitrust laws.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S3	The CIDs request the Company to answer interrogatories, and produce documents, or both, related to the investigation of matters including film clearances, potential coordination and/or communication with other major theatre circuits and related joint ventures.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S4	The Company intends to fully cooperate with all federal and state government agencies.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S5	Although the Company does not believe that it has violated any federal or state antitrust or competition laws, it cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S6	From time to time, the Company is involved in other various legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of its business operations, such as personal injury claims, employment matters, landlord-tenant disputes, patent claims and contractual disputes, some of which are covered by insurance or by indemnification from vendors.
1385280_16_ITEM10_P178_S7	The Company believes its potential liability with respect to these types of proceedings currently pending is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

1385280_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	We are one of the most geographically diverse worldwide exhibitors, with theatres in sixteen countries as of December 31, 2016.

1385280_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	Approximately $663.8 million, or 36%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and $5.7 million of our long-term debt matures in 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we built 18 new theatres with 144 screens and acquired four theatres with 52 screens.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly considering the expanding worldwide box office.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	We believe our portfolio of modern, high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid and consistent cash flows from operating activities.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	We continue to develop and expand new platforms and market adaptive concepts for our theatre circuit, such as XD, Luxury Lounger recliner seats, Cinemark Reserve, enhanced food and beverage, motion seats, Cin Arts and other premium concepts.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our XD screens represent the largest private label premium large format footprint in the industry.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our XD auditoriums offer a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including a Barco Auro 11.1 sound system or Dolby Atmos in select locations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P4_S5	The XD experience includes wall-to-wall screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in our XD auditoriums.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had 225 XD auditoriums in our worldwide circuit with plans to install 10 to 15 more XD auditoriums during 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	We have incorporated Luxury Lounger recliner seats in the majority of our domestic new builds and have also repositioned many of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 1,028 of our domestic auditoriums.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	We plan to continue to add additional Luxury Loungers in certain of our domestic locations during 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	We opened our first Cinemark Reserve concept in the U.S. during 2014, which features a VIP area with luxury recliner seating and other amenities along with a wide variety of food and beverage products.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	We offer this concept in seven domestic locations and in 23 of our international theatres, referred to locally as either Cinemark Premiere or Cinemark Prime.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	We plan to continue to incorporate this concept in four of our new domestic and international theatres and convert five of our existing locations during 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	We offer enhanced food and beverages such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums, at approximately 41% of our worldwide theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We currently have auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, which we refer to as motion seats.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	These motion seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and make the viewers feel as if they are part of the movie itself.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	We offer motion seats in 152 auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	We plan to add motion seats to 35 additional locations during 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P7_S4	Our Cin Arts locations provide moviegoers with the best selection of art and independent cinema in a captivating, unique environment and have set the industry standard for providing distinct, acclaimed and award-winning films.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P7_S5	We currently have 14 domestic theatres that are dedicated to art and independent content and 58 of our other domestic theatres also offer art and independent films on a limited basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry completed its conversion to digital projection technology during 2013.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	Currently, all of our domestic and first-run international theatres are fully digital.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	This format enables us to more efficiently move titles between auditoriums within a theatre to appropriately address demand for each title in real-time.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P9_S4	Digital projection also allows us to present 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, e-sports and gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P9_S5	Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	According to Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, approximately 14% and 15% of domestic box office for 2014 and 2015, respectively, was generated by 3-D tickets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	All of our domestic locations can receive movie and movie-related content via satellite through the content delivery network of Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, the motion picture exhibition industry joint venture established during 2013.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Approximately 75% of our domestic locations can also receive live content via satellite.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2015, we began the expansion of satellite delivery technology into our Latin American markets, initially for live event presentations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Seventy-four of our international theatres have the capability to receive live event feeds via satellite, with some of these locations also able to receive film content via satellite.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We expect that all of our international locations will have this capability by the end of 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry set an all-time box office record during 2015 with $11.1 billion in revenues and preliminary 2016 box office estimates indicate a new record has been set at approximately $11.3 billion, a 2% increase.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	The following table represents the results of a survey by MPAA published during March 2016, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2006 to 2015 (industry data for 2016 has not yet been released): Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars:
1385280_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War , The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool , Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice , Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing , among other films.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi , Beauty and the Beast , Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , Justice League , Spider Man: Homecoming , Despicable Me 3 , Thor: Ragnarok , The Fate of the Furious , Wonder Woman , and The Lego Batman Movie , among other films.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $27.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 4% increase over 2014.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 13% over 2014.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	Growth in Latin America continues to be fueled by a combination of growing populations, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), continued retail development in select markets, and quality product from Hollywood, including 3-D and alternative content offerings.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	We also believe some of these markets are underscreened in comparison to the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Drivers of Continued Industry Success We believe the following market trends will drive the continued strength of our industry: Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	A successful theatrical release brands a film and is one of the major contributors to a film s success in downstream markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, and network and syndicated television.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success .
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $27.2 billion, or approximately 71%, of 2015 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will continue to increase.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Many of the top U.S. films released during 2016 also performed exceptionally well in international markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	Such films included Star Wars: The Force Awakens , which grossed approximately $1.1 billion in international markets, or approximately 54% of its worldwide box office, Captain America: Civil War , which grossed approximately $745.1 million in international markets, or approximately 65% of its worldwide box office, and Zootopia, which grossed approximately $682.5 million in international markets, or approximately 67% of its worldwide box office.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	Over the past ten years, industry statistics have shown slight increases and decreases in attendance from one year to another, however domestic box office revenues have remained relatively stable during this period.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P17_S6	The industry has not experienced highly volatile results, even during recessionary periods, demonstrating the stability of the industry, its continued ability to attract consumers and the fact that box office performance is dependent on film product rather than economic cycles.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $8.43 in 2015.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	Average prices in 2015 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $28.00 to $85.00 per ticket according to MPAA.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our industry began the development of a content delivery network in domestic markets during 2013 and international markets during 2014.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Satellite delivery allows exhibitors to expand their product offerings, including the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Alternative entertainment may include pre-recorded programs as well as live sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	New and enhanced programming alternatives expand the industry s offerings to attract a broader customer base.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	Introduction of New Platforms and Product Offerings.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S5	The motion picture exhibition industry continues to develop new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S6	In addition to changing the overall style of, and amenities offered in, some theatres concession product offerings have continued to expand to more than just traditional popcorn and candy items.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P19_S7	Some locations now offer hot foods, alcohol offerings and/or healthier snack options for guests.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: Experienced Management.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zoradi, Chief Financial Officer Sean Gamble, and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our operational management team has many years of industry experience.

1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined operating philosophy that centers on building, and reinvesting in, high-quality theatres, while maintaining favorable theatre-level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets.

1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S4	Located in Top Latin American Markets.

1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S7	Our international screens generated revenues of $701.6 million, or 24% of our total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S8	We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina and have significant market presence in Colombia and Chile.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S9	Our geographic diversity makes us an important distribution channel for the movie studios.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S10	We offer a state-of-the-art movie-going experience, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S11	During 2016, we built 144 new screens worldwide.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S12	We currently have commitments to open 152 additional new screens over the next three years.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S13	We have installed digital projection technology in all of our worldwide auditoriums.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S14	Currently, approximately 55% of our U.S. screens and 66% of our international screens are 3-D compatible.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S15	We currently have 15 digital IMAX screens.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S16	As of December 31, 2016, we had the industry-leading private label premium large format circuit with 225 XD auditoriums in our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S17	We have plans to install 10 to 15 additional XD auditoriums during 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S18	We also continue to develop new market-adaptive theatre concepts in various markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S19	We believe we offer the brightest picture in the industry, with our Doremi servers and Barco digital projectors, and custom surround sound in our auditoriums.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S20	We have also established a centralized theatre support center that monitors and responds to projection performance and theatre network connectivity issues across our worldwide circuit on a real-time basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S21	We continue to grow organically as well as through the acquisition of high-quality theatres in select markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S22	Our growth strategy has centered around exceeding our return on investment thresholds while also complementing our existing theatre circuit.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S23	We continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which demonstrates the success of our growth strategy.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P22_S24	We believe a combination of our strong balance sheet and our expected level of cash flows will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities, while also allowing us to effectively service our debt obligations and continue to offer our stockholders a strong dividend yield.

1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Key components of our strategy include: Focus on Guest Experience.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	We differentiate our theatres by consistently focusing on the guest experience through a variety of initiatives.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	We have a market-adaptive approach with our theatre amenities, including Luxury Lounger recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and our private-label premium large format, XD.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S4	We feature loyalty programs in our largest markets, including the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Central America, which allows us to continue to learn more about our guest preferences and further enrich their movie-going experience.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S5	Our innovative and advanced technology selections allow us to consistently deliver the highest quality presentation to fully immerse our guests in the on-screen action.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S6	We also train, motivate, and empower our staff to provide first-rate customer service, ensuring our guests are continually pleased with their Cinemark experience.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S7	Driving attendance is our primary objective.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S8	We believe our focus on the guest experience is a catalyst for attendance growth.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S9	In addition to the Hollywood content, we also concentrate on initiatives to drive attendance during non-peak times, such as variable pricing methodologies and alternative content, including both participatory and spectator e-sports, Metropolitan Opera, concerts, live and pre-recorded sports, gaming, and other special presentations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S10	We continue to explore other alternatives, including virtual reality and entertainment complexes.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P23_S11	We believe our focus on attendance is a primary factor in our consistent industry-leading results.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Sustained Investment in Core Circuit Combined with Targeted Growth.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	We continually invest in our existing circuit to provide the highest quality experience for our guests.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	We routinely service and update theatre furniture, fixtures and equipment as well as invest in a variety of theatre upgrades such as Luxury Lounger recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage offerings, our XD private-label premium large format, and other amenities.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our commitment to investing in our existing circuit is demonstrated by our level of maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, at approximately $199 million and $237 million, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P24_S4	We also continue to target organic growth throughout our global circuit and seek accretive acquisition opportunities, with the objectives of deeper market penetration in the territories in which we currently operate and as a means to enter new and developing markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P24_S5	We built 144 new auditoriums and acquired 52 auditoriums during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Theatre Operations As of December 31, 2016, we operated 526 theatres and 5,903 screens in 41 U.S. states and 15 Latin American countries.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	The following tables summarize the geographic locations of our theatre circuit as of December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	(1) Includes Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Chile in 1993.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed one of the most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the region.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S4	We also have significant market presence in Colombia and Chile.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S5	We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S6	We intend to continue to build and expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S7	We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by transacting local operating expenses primarily in their respective local currencies.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S8	Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent local currency revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S9	We offer a variety of content at our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S10	We monitor upcoming films and other content and work with film distributors to license the content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S11	We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S12	We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in many locations, we offer our private-label premium format, XD.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S13	We also offer a format that features motion seats and added sensory features in addition to the ultra-realistic images of 3-D technology in select locations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S14	We also regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our guests.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S15	We have also established a Classic Series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies that change on a weekly basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P27_S16	The program covers many genres of classic films that are generally exhibited during non-peak times.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	During December 2013, we formed a joint venture, named AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, which then purchased the Fathom event business from National CineMedia, LLC.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Fathom event business generally focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres feature film schedules.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	programs, concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	We, along with AC JV, LLC, continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide entertainment to consumers.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	We are responsible for booking the films at each of our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	In most instances, we are able to license each first-run, wide-release film without regard to the bookings of other exhibitors within that area.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S4	In certain limited situations, our theatres compete with other nearby theatres for film licenses from film distributors.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S5	We face competition for patrons from other exhibitors and other forms of entertainment, as discussed under Competition below, at all of our theatres in all areas.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S6	In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S7	Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our guests, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S8	In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a film s box office receipts at each of our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P31_S9	Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a firm terms formula, as determined prior to a film s run, under which we pay a negotiated rate; a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film s run; or a rate that is negotiated after a film s run.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Food and Beverage Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 33% of total revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	We have devoted considerable management effort to increasing concession sales by expanding our offerings and adapting to our customers changing preferences, as discussed below.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	Common concession products offered at all of our theatres include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juice blends, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Other varieties and flavors of candy, snacks and drinks are offered at theatres based on consumer preferences in that particular market.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our guests, which are available at some locations, and also added alcohol offerings in a growing number of theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S3	Through our enhanced food, Cinemark Reserve and Cinemark Premier concepts, we have expanded concession product offerings to include a broader variety of food and drink options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S4	We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in certain domestic and international theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S5	Our proprietary point-of-sale system allows us to monitor product sales and readily make adjustments to product mix on a theatre-by-theatre or market-by-market basis, when necessary.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P33_S6	This program flexibility also allows us to efficiently activate and manage both national or regional product launches and promotional initiatives to further grow food and beverage sales.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchase incidence and generate sales to existing buyers as well as to attract new buyers.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	We offer specially-priced product combinations at our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	We routinely offer discounts to our guests on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discounted price.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	In certain international countries and in all of our domestic theatres, we offer a loyalty program to our frequent guests which often includes food and beverage benefits.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques and maintaining concession product quality.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Consumer promotions may include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which may include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving guests in an expedited manner.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	We incorporate self-serve candy cases and bottled drink coolers at our traditional crew-serve theatres to help drive purchase incidence as well as increase product availability for these two core categories.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	We also have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices, impulse purchases and superior visibility of concession items.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	In some of our international locations, we allow guests to pre-order concession items, either online or at a kiosk, and pick them up in a dedicated line at the concession counter.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and negotiate rebates.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Concession supplies are generally distributed through a distribution network.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	The concession distributor delivers inventory to the theatres after receiving orders directly from the theatres or through an online electronic ordering system.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	We conduct frequent inventory counts of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our customers.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Pre-Feature Screen Advertising In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen advertising revenue on a per patron basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had an approximate 19% ownership interest in NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	In our international markets, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, handles our screen advertising functions in Brazil.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our Brazil theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to other exhibitors in Brazil through revenue share agreements.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	In Argentina, we have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our Argentina theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	We recently acquired advertising businesses in Chile, Central America and Colombia, which we will integrate with our Flix Media division.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S5	In our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S6	The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S7	In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P42_S8	In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Media s services to include, among other things, alternative content, online ticketing, and loyalty initiatives.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry has undertaken certain technology initiatives over the past few years, as discussed below.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition Through the joint venture DCDC with Regal, AMC, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and Universal Pictures, we began delivering digital content to domestic theatres via satellite during October 2013.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	As of December 31, 2016, 100% of our domestic auditoriums were capable of receiving content via satellite.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S2	Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S3	The satellite delivery system established by DCDC is available to all exhibitors and content providers and allows live and store-and-forward content to be delivered to our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S4	The industry is beginning to expand satellite delivery technology to certain Latin American markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S5	Currently, 74 of our international theatres have the ability to receive live events via satellite, with some of these also able to receive film content via satellite.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S6	We expect all of our international theatres to have the ability to receive content via satellite by the end of 2017.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S7	Marketing We generally market our theatres and special events, including grand openings and VIP events, using Internet digital advertising, directory film schedules, and radio and television advertising spots.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S8	We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S9	We offer guests access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S10	Customers can subscribe to our weekly emails to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about upcoming Cinemark XD movies, advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P44_S11	Email communications and push notifications are utilized to provide customers with the latest information or exclusive offers such as screenings, contests or promotions.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	These programs may involve customer contests that include exclusive giveaways, cross-promotions with the media and other third parties and other means to impact patronage for films showing at our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	We interact with guests every day on social media platforms, such as, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to provide relevant information and quick access to advanced ticketing information, and upcoming movies and events.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S3	Guests can utilize social media to ask us questions regarding their local Cinemark theatre offerings, movie-related information or to provide suggestions.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S4	We offer a domestic loyalty program to our guests, called Connections, which began in 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S5	Connections allows our guests to earn points for different types of transactions and interactions as tracked through our Cinemark smart phone app.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S6	Points can then be redeemed for various concession discounts and items, as well as unique and limited edition experiential rewards that relate to films currently playing at our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S7	During 2016, approximately 1.1 million of our guests signed up for Connections.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S8	We also offer a feature in our app, called CineMode, which dims the phone s screen and rewards guests for silencing their phones during the movie.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S9	Guests are rewarded for use of CineMode with loyalty points as well as other exclusive digital rewards that can be used at a future visit to one of our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S10	We also have loyalty programs in most of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S11	Our Connections and other loyalty programs put us in direct contact with our guests and provides additional opportunities for us to further expand our relationships with the studios and our vendors through promotions.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P45_S12	Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	businesses as an employee-incentive or rewards program.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting guests, licensing films and developing new theatre sites.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal and AMC and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cin polis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), and Araujo.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at many of our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	In certain limited situations, distributors allocate movies to only one theatre in a market generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	In all theatres, our success in attracting guests depends on customer service quality, location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability and ticket prices.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue potential, and financial stability.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the public s leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of results for the following period or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Corporate Operations Our worldwide headquarters is located in Plano, Texas.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, including our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax, audit and information technology.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our U.S. operations are divided into nineteen regions, each of which is headed by a region leader.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have nine regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fifteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are managed out of one Central American regional office).
1385280_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	Each regional office is headed by a general manager with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and finance.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	We have chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina, which are our two largest international markets and a regional chief financial officer located in Chile that oversees Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P51_S4	Employees We have approximately 19,200 employees in the U.S., approximately 20% of whom are full time employees and 80% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	markets, approximately 34% of whom are full time employees and approximately 66% of whom are part time employees.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	Due to the seasonal nature of our business as discussed above, our headcount can vary throughout the year, depending on the timing and success of movie releases.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors has been influenced by consent decrees resulting from these cases.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our domestic and international theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	We currently have operations in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao, and Paraguay, which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for segment information and financial information by geographic area.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The unexpected emergence of a successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	revenues and 45 of the top 50 grossing films during 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from the antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the six major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In markets where we do not face nearby competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The degree of competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, products and amenities offered, and ticket prices.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We also face competition from new concept theatres such as dine-in theatres and tavern style theatres that open in close proximity to our conventional theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S8	An increase in the use of alternative film distribution channels or other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S9	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S10	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S11	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video and digital release windows.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S13	Over the last decade, the average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately ninety days.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P5_S14	If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Film studios occasionally offer consumers a premium video on-demand option for certain films shortly after the theatrical release.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These release windows, which are determined by the studios, may shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If consumers discretionary income declines as a result of an economic downturn, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have 187 theatres with 1,344 screens in fifteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Brazil represented approximately 10.4% of our consolidated 2016 revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the United States.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Changes in regulations affecting prices, quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films and restrictions on ownership of property may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and cash transfers to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we had $1,823.0 million in long-term debt obligations, $255.4 million in capital lease obligations and $1,680.0 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be able to continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 19%.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Company received approximately $9.2 million, $11.3 million, and $11.0 million in other revenues from NCM, respectively, and $18.5 million, $18.1 million and $14.7 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	While we continue to implement the latest technological innovations, such as 3-D, motion seats and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We will continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S11	The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P11_S13	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may not be able to obtain such financing or ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we do not comply with the ADA and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	On November 15, 2004, Cinemark and the DOJ entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	We may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the U.S., we are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We are also subject to union regulations in certain of our international markets, which can specify wage rates as well as minimum hours to be paid to certain employees.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As union wage rates and other requirements change, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We have a significant amount of long-lived assets.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, therefore if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we performed either a qualitative or quantitative analysis on all of our goodwill and tradename intangible assets and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are below their respective carrying values.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Certain provisions of our 4.875% senior notes indenture and our 5.125% senior notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 4.875% senior notes and our 5.125% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	A change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S7	As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of 178,179,343 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S8	In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S9	We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S10	As of December 31, 2016, we had 116,210,252 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Of these shares, approximately 105,132,082 shares were freely tradable.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S12	The remaining shares of our Common Stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P20_S13	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2016, there were 6,885,188 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P23_S10	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Cyber security threats and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information of our customers and employees.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	We also rely on some of our vendors to store certain data.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	While we have adopted industry-accepted security measures and technology to protect the confidential and proprietary information, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	As such, we may be unable to anticipate and implement adequate preventive measures in time.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	This may adversely affect our business, including exposure to government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or attacks, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by breaches affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Product recalls and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S6	We are resellers of food and we may be liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S7	We are also subject to recall by product manufacturers or if the food products become contaminated.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Recalls could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of the product and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Our cinemas rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P25_S11	Any expansion on existing and/or new laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation or data protection could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to our marketing strategy which could adversely impact our attendance levels and revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to complex taxation and could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We are subject to many different forms of taxation both in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The tax authorities may not agree with the determinations that we made and such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts for tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material impact on our results.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
1385280_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If the Company s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company s taxes owed in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P0_S0	into on a long-term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 20 to 45 years.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 7.7% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 23 theatres with 168 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of less than six years.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P0_S2	Approximately 8.1% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 24 theatres with 300 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of between six and 15 years and approximately 84.2% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 251 theatres with 3,483 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of more than 15 years.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P0_S3	The leases generally provide for a fixed monthly minimum rent payment, with certain leases also subject to additional percentage rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P1_S0	We currently own an office building in Plano, Texas, which is our worldwide headquarters.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P1_S1	We lease office space in Frisco, Texas and McKinney, Texas for theatre support and maintenance personnel.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S0	International As of December 31, 2016, internationally, we operated 187 theatres with 1,344 screens, all of which are leased.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S1	Our international leases are generally entered into on a long term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S2	The leases generally provide for contingent rental based upon operating results with an annual minimum.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 15.0% of our international theatre leases, covering 28 theatres with 239 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of less than six years.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S4	Approximately 47.6% of our international theatre leases, covering 89 theatres and 656 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of between six and 15 years and approximately 37.4% of our international theatre leases, covering 70 theatres and 449 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of more than 15 years.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S5	The leases generally provide for a fixed monthly minimum rent payment, with certain leases also subject to additional percentage rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S6	We also lease office space in seven regions in Latin America for our local management.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S7	See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our minimum lease commitments.
1385280_17_ITEM1B_P2_S8	We periodically review the profitability of each of our theatres, particularly those whose lease terms are nearing expiration, to determine whether to continue its operations.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The case presents putative class action claims for damages and attorney s fees arising from employee wage and hour claims under California law for alleged meal period, rest break, reporting time pay, unpaid wages, pay upon termination, and wage statements violations.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney General Act ( PAGA ).
1385280_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	We deny the claims, deny that class certification is appropriate and deny that a PAGA representative action is appropriate, and are vigorously defending against the claims.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P0_S3	We deny any violation of law and plans to vigorously defend against all claims.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P0_S4	The Court recently determined that class certification is not appropriate and determined that a PAGA representative action is not appropriate.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P0_S5	The plaintiff has appealed these rulings.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	We are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert, LLC d/b/a Cinemas Palme D Or v. Century Theatres, Inc., and Cinemark USA, Inc.; Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles .
1385280_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Plaintiff in this case alleges that we violated California antitrust and unfair competition laws by engaging in circuit dealing with various motion picture distributors and tortuously interfered with Plaintiff s business relationships.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, trebling of those damages under California law, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs and interest.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	Plaintiff also alleges that our conduct ultimately resulted in closure of its theatre in June 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	In 2008, we moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff s claims, arguing primarily that clearances between the theatres at issue were lawful and that Plaintiff lacked proof sufficient to support certain technical elements of its antitrust claims.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	The trial court granted that motion and dismissed Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S2	Plaintiff appealed and, in 2011, the Court of Appeal reversed, holding, among other things, that Plaintiff s claims were not about the illegality of clearances but were focused, instead, on circuit dealing.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S3	Having re-framed the claims in that manner, the Court of Appeal held that the trial court s decision to limit discovery to the market where the theatres at issue operated was an error, as circuit dealing necessarily involves activities in different markets.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S4	Upon return to the trial court, the parties engaged in additional, broadened discovery related to Plaintiff s circuit dealing claim.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S5	Thereafter, we moved again for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S6	That new motion for summary judgment was pending when, on or about April 11, 2014, the trial court granted our motion for terminating sanctions and entered a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P3_S7	Plaintiff then appealed that second dismissal, seeking to have the judgment reversed and the case remanded to the trial court.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	The Court of Appeal issued a ruling on May 24, 2016, reversing the granting of terminating sanctions and instead imposed a lesser evidentiary and damages preclusion sanction.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	The case returned to the trial court on October 6, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	We have denied Plaintiff s allegations and are vigorously defending these claims.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S3	We are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S4	We received a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S5	The CID relates to an investigation under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P4_S6	We also received CIDs from the Antitrust Section of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ohio and later from other states regarding similar inquiries under state antitrust laws.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	The CIDs request us to answer interrogatories, and produce documents, or both, related to the investigation of matters including film clearances, potential coordination and/or communication with other major theatre circuits and related joint ventures.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	We intend to fully cooperate with all federal and state government agencies.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P5_S2	Although we do not believe that we have violated any federal or state antitrust or competition laws, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P5_S3	From time to time, we are involved in other various legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business operations, such as personal injury claims, employment matters, landlord-tenant disputes, patent claims and contractual disputes, some of which are covered by insurance or by indemnification from vendors.
1385280_17_ITEM3_P5_S4	We believe our potential liability with respect to these types of proceedings currently pending is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	and low sales prices per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the years indicated.

1385280_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of the uncertainties and risk associated with these statements.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Revenues and Expenses We generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars:
1385280_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War , The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool , Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice , Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing , among other films.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi , Beauty and the Beast , Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , Justice League , Spider Man: Homecoming , Despicable Me 3 , Thor: Ragnarok , The Fate of the Furious , Wonder Woman , and The Lego Batman Movie , among other films.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P4_S5	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily include utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P8_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S6	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S7	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P12_S8	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee owned properties.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations).
1385280_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2014, requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2014.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our goodwill exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ).
1385280_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	During 2014, we estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company s tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for all indefinite-lived tradename assets other than our tradename in Ecuador, for which we performed a quantitative assessment.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The qualitative assessments included consideration of the Company s historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	Based on the qualitative assessments performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	Our quantitative test for our tradename in Ecuador included estimating the fair value of the tradename based on forecasted revenues for our Ecuador theatres multiplied by an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our tradename in Ecuador exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we also performed a test on our definite-lived tradename associated with the Rave theatres acquired in 2013.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	We recently rebranded certain of these theatres with Cinemark signage as part of recliner conversions and other renovations.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	We estimated the fair value of the Rave tradename by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename to forecasted future revenues for the theatres using the Rave tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our Rave tradename intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment).
1385280_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P42_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Recent Developments On February 22, 2017, our board of directors approved a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.29 per share of common stock payable to stockholders of record on March 8, 2017.

1385280_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	Such expenses, which totaled $19.6 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $23.9 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 are now presented as utilities and other.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	(2) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2014.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results.

1385280_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Salaries and wages increased to $226.9 million for 2015 from $202.8 million for 2014 primarily due to increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, new theatres and increases in minimum wages.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	Facility lease expense increased to $239.4 million for 2015 from $235.2 million for 2014 primarily due to new theatres and increased percentage rent expense due to increased revenues.

1385280_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The as reported increase was due to new theatres, increased staffing levels to support the increased attendance, limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations and increased local currency wage rates.
1385280_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	Facility lease expense decreased to $80.3 million (increase to $99.3 million in constant currency) for 2015 from $81.9 for 2014.

1385280_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	The loss recorded during 2014 was primarily due to the retirement of certain theatre equipment that was replaced during the period, lease termination charges recorded for theatre closures and a charge for termination of a vendor contract.

1385280_17_ITEM7_P149_S3	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At December 31, 2016, there was an aggregate of approximately $663.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $6.6 million.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2016:

1385280_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary, which could impact future results of operations as reported.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments.
1385280_17_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $62 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 by approximately $8 million, $7 million and $8 million, respectively.

1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cinemark Holdings, Inc.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S1	Plano, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P8_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P9_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P9_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P9_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P9_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P9_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1385280_17_ITEM9_P9_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P13_S0	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) operates in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States ( U.S. ), Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Cura ao and Paraguay.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P13_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P13_S2	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P13_S3	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P13_S4	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P13_S5	Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P14_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of operating funds held in financial institutions, petty cash held by the theatres and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P14_S1	Cash investments are primarily in money market funds or other similar funds.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P14_S2	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, which are recorded at net realizable value, consist primarily of receivables related to screen advertising, receivables related to discounted tickets sold to retail locations, receivables from landlords related to theatre construction, rebates earned from the Company s beverage and other concession vendors and value-added and other non-income tax receivables.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P15_S0	Inventories Concession and theatre supplies inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P15_S1	Theatre Properties and Equipment Theatre properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P16_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P17_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P18_S0	remodels or other substantial improvements, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P19_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P19_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P19_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability the exercise of available renewal periods or extensions, for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee-owned properties.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P20_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P20_S1	When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group, the asset group is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P21_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S1	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S3	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S4	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S5	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and seven countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S6	Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2014, requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P22_S7	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2014.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company s goodwill exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment ( ASU 2011-08 ).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S5	The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P23_S6	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P24_S0	The Company performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P24_S1	The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P24_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P24_S3	Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P25_S0	CINEMARK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P25_S1	During 2014, the Company estimated the fair value of its tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P25_S2	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P26_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S0	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S4	The qualitative assessments included consideration of the Company s historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S5	Based on the qualitative assessments performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S6	The quantitative test for our tradename in Ecuador included estimating the fair value of the tradename based on forecasted revenues for our Ecuador theatres multiplied by an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S7	As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our tradename in Ecuador exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S8	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company also performed a quantitative test on our definite-lived tradename associated with the Rave theatres acquired in 2013.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P27_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company rebranded certain of these theatres with Cinemark signage as part of recliner conversions and other renovations.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P28_S0	The Company estimated the fair value of the Rave tradename by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename to forecasted future revenues for the theatres using the Rave tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of the Rave tradename intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P28_S2	The table below summarizes the Company s intangible assets and the amortization method used for each type of intangible asset:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P29_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying contracts.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P29_S1	The remaining terms of the underlying contracts range from one to four years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P30_S0	Based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are realized over the terms of the lease agreements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P30_S1	The remaining terms of the lease agreements range from approximately three to twenty years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P31_S0	Straight-line method over the terms of the underlying agreement or the expected useful life of the intangible asset.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P31_S1	The remaining useful lives of these intangible assets range from two to ten years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P32_S0	Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets consist of long-term prepaid rents, construction and other deposits, equipment to be placed in service, and other assets of a long-term nature.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P32_S1	Long-term prepaid rents represent prepayments of rent on operating leases.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P33_S0	lease expense over the period for which the rent was paid in advance as outlined in the lease agreements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P33_S1	The remaining amortization periods generally range from two to fifteen years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P34_S0	Lease Accounting The Company evaluates each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P34_S1	The Company records the lease as a capital lease at its inception if 1) the present value of future minimum lease payments exceeds 90% of the leased property s estimated fair value; 2) the lease term exceeds 75% of the property s estimated useful life; 3) the lease contains a bargain purchase option; or 4) ownership transfers to the Company at the end of the lease.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P34_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S0	If the lease agreement calls for a scheduled rent increase during the lease term, the Company recognizes the lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S1	The Company determines the straight-line rent expense impact of an operating lease upon inception of the lease.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S2	For some new build theatres, the landlord is responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S3	For other theatres, the Company is responsible for managing construction of the theatre and the landlord contributes an agreed upon amount to the costs of construction.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S4	If the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S5	At the end of the construction period, the Company determines if the transaction qualifies for sale-leaseback accounting treatment in regards to lease classification.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P35_S6	If the Company receives a lease incentive payment from a landlord, the Company records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the initial term of the respective lease.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P36_S0	Deferred Revenues Advances collected on long-term screen advertising, concession and other contracts are recorded as deferred revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P36_S1	In accordance with the terms of the agreements, the advances collected on such contracts are recognized during the period in which the advances are earned, which may differ from the period in which the advances are collected.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P36_S2	These advances are recognized on either a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts or as such revenues are earned in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P36_S3	The remaining amortization periods generally range from one to twenty years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S0	The Company is self-insured for general liability claims subject to an annual cap.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, general liability claims were capped at $100 per occurrence with annual caps of approximately $2,670, $2,900 and $3,350, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S2	The Company was also self-insured for medical claims up to $125, $125 and $150 per occurrence for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S3	The Company is fully insured for workers compensation claims.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Company s insurance reserves were $9,039 and $7,837, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S5	Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P37_S6	Other revenues include screen advertising and other ancillary revenues such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in the Company s theatres.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P38_S0	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P38_S1	The Company records proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognizes admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P38_S2	The Company recognizes unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P38_S3	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, the Company considers the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, the Company s liabilities for advanced sale-type certificates were approximately $68,158 and $70,247, respectively, and are reflected in accrued other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P40_S0	Company recognized unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenues in the amount of $12,233, $11,786 and $11,522 during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P41_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P41_S1	Under a firm terms formula, the Company pays the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P42_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P42_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P43_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P43_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P43_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P43_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at the time of settlement.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P44_S0	The Company launched its app-based Connections loyalty program for its domestic markets in February 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P44_S1	Customers earn points for initial sign-up and for various transactions as tracked within the app.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P44_S2	Points may be redeemed for concessions items, concession discounts and experiential rewards, each of which are offered for limited periods of time and at varying times during the year.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P44_S3	The Company has determined that the values of the rewards offered to the customer are insignificant to the original transactions required to earn such rewards and has applied the incremental cost approach to accounting for the rewards earned.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P44_S4	The Company had approximately $0.8 million recorded in accrued other current liabilities for rewards earned and not yet redeemed as of December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P45_S0	We also have loyalty programs in certain of our international markets, which generally consist of the customer paying a membership fee in exchange for discounts during the membership period.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P45_S1	The costs of these loyalty programs are not considered significant to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P46_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity award based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P46_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using a market observed price.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P47_S0	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P47_S1	At the time of the grant, the Company also estimates the number of instruments that will ultimately be forfeited.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P47_S2	See Note 14 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P48_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P48_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P48_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P49_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P49_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P50_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P50_S1	The first step is recognition: The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P50_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P51_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P52_S0	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P52_S1	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P53_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P54_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P55_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P55_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P55_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P56_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P56_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P56_S2	See Note 12 for a summary of the translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P57_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P58_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P59_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P59_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P59_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P60_S0	The Company had an interest rate swap agreement and investments in marketable securities that were adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P60_S1	With respect to its interest rate swap agreement, the Company used the income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreement and under this approach, the Company used projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreement and the fixed rate that the Company was obligated to pay under the agreement.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P60_S2	Therefore, the Company s fair value measurements for its interest rate swap used significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P60_S3	The interest rate swap agreement expired in April 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P61_S0	With respect to its investments in marketable securities, the Company used quoted market prices, which fall under Level 1 of the hierarchy.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P61_S1	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 or 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P61_S2	See Note 11 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P61_S3	The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis, primarily in the impairment evaluations for goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P61_S4	See Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Theatre Properties and Equipment included above for discussion of such fair value measurements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P62_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P62_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S0	the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S1	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts realized.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S2	The Company provides assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S3	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S4	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S5	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P63_S6	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methodologies utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P64_S0	The Company has reclassified $26,664 and $30,950 in expenses from film rentals and advertising costs to utilities and other costs on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively, to be consistent with the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P64_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company determined that reclassifying the expenses, which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, results in a more clear presentation of film rentals and advertising costs.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P65_S0	NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014-09 ).

1385280_17_ITEM10_P69_S2	The amendments in these accounting standards updates may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P69_S3	The Company will adopt the amendments within these accounting standards updates in the first quarter of 2018.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P69_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standards updates on its consolidated financial statements, specifically with respect to the Company s Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM, loyalty program accounting, breakage income for stored value cards as well as other ancillary and contractual revenues.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P70_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , ( ASU 2015-02 ).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P70_S1	ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P70_S2	Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P70_S3	ASU 2015-02 also provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P71_S0	ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P71_S1	Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02, which had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P71_S3	The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P71_S4	The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P71_S5	New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P71_S6	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P72_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P90_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P91_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P91_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior ESA, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P91_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P91_S4	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P91_S6	The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the first such increase taking effect after the end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P91_S7	For 2014, 2015 and 2016, the annual payment per digital screen was one thousand one hundred twenty-five dollars, one thousand one hundred eighty-two dollars and one thousand two hundred forty-one dollars, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P92_S0	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P92_S1	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P92_S2	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 20 years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P93_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P93_S1	Following the NCMI IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM s net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P93_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P93_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P93_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P94_S0	Common Unit Adjustments Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCMI and the Company, AMC and Regal, which we refer to collectively as the Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P95_S1	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P95_S2	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P95_S3	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P95_S4	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P95_S5	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P95_S6	Our Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P96_S0	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P96_S1	If the Company then elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Tranche 2 Investment at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P96_S2	Below is a summary of common units received by the Company under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016:

1385280_17_ITEM10_P135_S0	(1) The Company was previously party to an interest rate swap agreement.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P135_S1	That agreement expired in April 2016.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): The Company also uses the market approach for fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis in the impairment evaluations of its long-lived assets (see Note 7 and Note 8).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P137_S1	Additionally, the Company uses the market approach to estimate the fair value of its long-term debt (see Note 10).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P137_S2	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P137_S3	There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P138_S0	The accumulated other comprehensive loss account in stockholders equity of $271,686 and $247,013 at December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, includes the cumulative foreign currency losses of $273,407 and $247,046, respectively, from translating the financial statements of the Company s international subsidiaries, the change in fair values of the Company s interest rate swap agreements that were designated as hedges and the changes in fair value of the Company s previously held available-for-sale securities.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P139_S0	All foreign countries where the Company has operations are non-highly inflationary and the local currency is the same as the functional currency in all of the locations.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P139_S1	Thus, any fluctuation in the currency results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P139_S2	Below is a summary of the impact of translating the financial statements of the Company s international subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P140_S0	NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries of the Company were as follows at December 31:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P141_S0	During December 2016 the Company purchased the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest of one of its Chilean subsidiaries, Flix Impirica S.A. ( Flix Impirica ), for approximately $450 in cash.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P141_S1	The increase in the Company s ownership interest in the Chilean subsidiary was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-45-23.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P141_S2	The Company recorded a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of approximately $27, which represented the difference between the cash paid and the book value of the Chilean subsidiary s noncontrolling interest account, which was approximately $423.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P141_S3	As a result of this transaction, the Company now owns 100% of the shares in Flix Impirica.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P141_S4	Below is a summary of the impact of changes in the Company s ownership interest in its subsidiaries on its equity:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P142_S0	Common Stock Common stockholders are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P142_S1	Subject to the rights of holders of any then outstanding shares of the Company s preferred stock, the Company s common stockholders are entitled to any dividends that may be declared by the board of directors.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P142_S2	The shares of the Company s common stock are not subject to any redemption provisions.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P142_S3	The Company has no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P142_S4	The Company s ability to pay dividends is effectively limited by its status as a holding company and the terms of its subsidiary s indentures and senior secured credit facility, which also significantly restricts the ability of certain of the Company s subsidiaries to pay dividends directly or indirectly to the Company.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P142_S5	Furthermore, certain of the Company s foreign subsidiaries currently have a deficit in retained earnings which prevents the Company from declaring and paying dividends from those subsidiaries.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P143_S0	Treasury Stock Treasury stock represents shares of common stock repurchased by the Company and not yet retired.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P143_S1	The Company has applied the cost method in recording its treasury shares.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P151_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these restricted stock awards was approximately $12,328.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P151_S5	The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S0	Restricted Stock Units During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Company granted restricted stock units representing 197,515, 142,917 and 253,661 hypothetical shares of common stock, respectively, to employees.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S1	The restricted stock units vest based on a combination of financial performance factors and continued service.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S2	The financial performance factors are based on an implied equity value concept that determines an internal rate of return ( IRR ) for a two year measurement period, as defined in the award agreement, based on a formula utilizing a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA subject to certain specified adjustments (as defined in the restricted stock unit award agreement).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S3	The financial performance factors for the restricted stock units have a threshold, target and maximum level of payment opportunity and vest on a prorata basis according to the IRR achieved by the Company during the performance period.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S4	As an example, if the Company achieves an IRR equal to 11.0% for the 2014 grant, the number of restricted stock units that shall vest will be greater than the target but less than the maximum number that would have vested had the Company achieved the highest IRR.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S5	All payouts of restricted stock units that vest will be subject to an additional service requirement and will be paid in the form of common stock if the participant continues to provide services through the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S6	The financial performance factors and respective vesting rates for each of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 grants are as follows: At the time of each of the restricted stock unit grants, the Company assumes the IRR level to be reached for the defined measurement period will be the mid-point IRR level in determining the amount of compensation expense to record for such grants.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S7	If and when additional information becomes available to indicate that something other than the mid-point IRR level will be achieved, the Company adjusts compensation expense on a prospective basis over the remaining service period.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S8	The Company assumed forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 13% for the restricted stock unit awards granted during 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P152_S9	Restricted stock unit award participants are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments if and at the time the restricted stock unit awards vest.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P154_S0	Below is a summary of activity for restricted stock unit awards for the periods indicated:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P155_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a modification to each of the 2013 and 2014 restricted stock unit grants.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P155_S1	The modifications resulted in a cap on the foreign currency exchange rate devaluation impact to be used in calculating the IRR for the respective measurement periods.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P155_S2	The Company revalued each of the grants based on the Company s stock price at the date of modification, which was $33.02.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P155_S3	The modifications resulted in incremental compensation expense of approximately $2,460 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P156_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a modification to the 2015 restricted stock unit grants.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P156_S1	The modification resulted in a cap on the foreign currency exchange rate devaluation impact to be used in calculating the IRR for the respective measurement periods.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P156_S2	The Company revalued each of the grants based on the Company s stock price at the date of modification, which was $37.98.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P156_S3	The modifications resulted in incremental compensation expense of approximately $562 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had restricted stock units outstanding that represented a total 557,077 hypothetical shares of common stock, net of actual cumulative forfeitures of 30,598 units, assuming the maximum IRR is achieved for all of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P157_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $6,791, which reflects the maximum IRR level that was achieved for the 2013 and 2014 grants, the maximum IRR level that was achieved for the 2015 grants and an IRR level of 8.0% that is estimated to be achieved for the 2016 grant.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P157_S2	The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P158_S0	The following is provided as supplemental information to the consolidated statements of cash flows:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P159_S0	Income before income taxes consisted of the following: Current and deferred income taxes were as follows:

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data A reconciliation between income tax expense and taxes computed by applying the applicable statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes follows: The Company reinvests the accumulated undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P160_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $251,000 of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, as it is the Company s policy to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in non-U.S. operations.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P160_S2	However, the Company may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an additional U.S. tax liability.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P160_S3	Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested accumulated earnings is not practicable.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P161_S1	Some foreign net operating losses will expire in the next reporting period; however, some losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P161_S2	State net operating losses may be carried forward for periods of between five and twenty years with the last expiring year being 2036.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P161_S3	The Company s valuation allowance changed from $50,636 at December 31, 2015 to $14,524 at December 31, 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P161_S4	The decrease was a result of the implementation of a foreign holding and financing structure, which increased the Company s ability to use foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P162_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016:
1385280_17_ITEM10_P163_S0	The Company had $17,008 and $18,190 of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P163_S1	Of these amounts, $17,008 and $18,190 represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would impact the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P163_S2	The Company had $3,198 and $4,111 accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P164_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P164_S1	The Company believes that its accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on its assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P164_S2	This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P164_S3	The Company is no longer subject to income tax audits from the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2013.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P164_S4	The Company is no longer subject to state income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major state jurisdictions for years before 2012.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P164_S5	Certain state returns were amended as a result of the Internal Revenue Service examination closures for 2007 through 2009, and the statutes remain open for those amendments.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P165_S1	In addition to the minimum annual lease payments, some of the leases provide for contingent rentals based on operating results of the theatre and most require the payment of taxes, insurance and other costs applicable to the property.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P165_S2	The Company can renew, at its option, a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then market rental rates for various periods.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P165_S3	Some leases also provide for escalating rent payments throughout the lease term.

1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S0	Legal Proceedings Joseph Amey, et al. v. Cinemark USA, Inc., Case No. 3:13cv05669, In the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S1	The case presents putative class action claims for damages and attorney s fees arising from employee wage and hour claims under California law for alleged meal period, rest break, reporting time pay, unpaid wages, pay upon termination, and wage statements violations.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S2	The claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney General Act ( PAGA ).
1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S3	The Company denies the claims, denies that class certification is appropriate and denies that a PAGA representative action is appropriate, and is vigorously defending against the claims.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S4	The Company denies any violation of law and plans to vigorously defend against all claims.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S5	The Court recently determined that class certification is not appropriate and determined that a PAGA representative action is not appropriate.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P170_S6	The plaintiff has appealed these rulings.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P171_S0	The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P172_S0	Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert, LLC d/b/a Cinemas Palme D Or v. Century Theatres, Inc., and Cinemark USA, Inc.; Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles .
1385280_17_ITEM10_P172_S1	Plaintiff in this case alleges that the Company violated California antitrust and unfair competition laws by engaging in circuit dealing with various motion picture distributors and tortuously interfered with Plaintiff s business relationships.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P172_S2	Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, trebling of those damages under California law, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs and interest.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P172_S3	Plaintiff also alleges that the Company s conduct ultimately resulted in closure of its theatre in June 2016.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S0	In 2008, the Company moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff s claims, arguing primarily that clearances between the theatres at issue were lawful and that Plaintiff lacked proof sufficient to support certain technical elements of its antitrust claims.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S1	The trial court granted that motion and dismissed Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S2	Plaintiff appealed and, in 2011, the Court of Appeal reversed, holding, among other things, that Plaintiff s claims were not about the illegality of clearances but were focused, instead, on circuit dealing.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S3	Having re-framed the claims in that manner, the Court of Appeal held that the trial court s decision to limit discovery to the market where the theatres at issue operated was an error, as circuit dealing necessarily involves activities in different markets.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S4	Upon return to the trial court, the parties engaged in additional, broadened discovery related to Plaintiff s circuit dealing claim.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S5	Thereafter, the Company moved again for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_17_ITEM10_P173_S6	That new motion for summary judgment was pending when, on or about April 11, 2014, the trial court granted the Company s motion for terminating sanctions and entered a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, film rental is paid as a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	Accordingly, final settlements typically approximate estimates since box office receipts are known at the time the estimate is made and the expected success of a film can typically be estimated early in the film s run.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at the time of settlement.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Company launched its app-based Connections loyalty program for its domestic markets in February 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Points may be r edeemed for concessions items, concession discounts and experiential rewards, each of which are offered for limited periods of time and at varying times during the year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	The Company has determined that the values of the rewards offered to the customer are insignificant to the original transactions required to earn such rewards and has applied the incremental cost approach to accounting for the rewards earned.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	The Company also has loyalty programs in certain of its international markets, which generally cons ist of the customer paying a membership fee in exchange for discounts during the membership period.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	The Company had approximately $5,527 recorded in accrued other current liabilities for its loyalty programs as of December 31, 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	See Note 2 for discuss ion of impact of new revenue recognition accounting pronouncements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity award based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	The grant date fair value is estimated using a market observed price.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Such costs are recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (which is usually the vesting period).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	At the time of the grant, the Company also estimates the number of awards that will ultimately be forfeited.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	See Note 14 for discussion of the Company s share based awards and related compensation expense.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	The first step is recognition: The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company should presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P47_S2	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Company accrues interest and penalties on its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	Segments For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Company managed its business under two reportable operating segments, U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	The Company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	The assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	See Note 12 for a summary of the translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The Company recognizes foreign currency transaction gains and losses when changes in exchange rates impact transactions, other than intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature, that have been denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	According to authoritative guidance, inputs used in fair value measurements fall into three different categories; Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the rep orting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P54_S2	Level 3 inputs are unobservable input s for the asset or liability.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Company had an interest rate swap agreement and investments in marketable securities that were adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis (quarterly).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	With respect to its interest rate swap agreement, the Company used th e income approach to determine the fair value of its interest rate swap agreement and under this approach, the Company used projected future interest rates as provided by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreement and the fixed rate that the Co mpany was obligated to pay under the agreement.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	Therefore, the Company s fair value measurements for its interest rate swap used significant unobservable inputs, which fall in Level 3.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P55_S3	The interest rate swap agreement expired in April 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	With respect t o its investments in marketable securities, the Company used quoted market prices, which fall under Level 1 of the hierarchy.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period and no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	See Note 11 for further discussion of the Company s fair value measurements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis, primarily in the impairment evaluations for goodwill, inta ngible assets and other long-lived assets.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P56_S4	See Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Theatre Properties and Equipment included above for discussion of such fair value measurements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts realized.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	The Company provides assumptions, including both quantitative and qualitative information, about the specified asset or liability to the third party valuation firms.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P58_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P58_S3	The Company then uses the information to record estimated fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P58_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P58_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the assumptions and valuation methodologies utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Impact of New Revenue Recognition Standard In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , ( ASC 606 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	ASC 606 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	ASC 606 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Company adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	The new standard will therefore be applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	While the Company does not believe the adoption of ASC 606 will have a materia l impact to its results of operations or cash flows, it does expect ASC 606 to have an impact on the classification of certain revenues and related expenses, as summarized below.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	Quantitative amounts included below are estimates of the expected effects of the Company s adoption of ASC 606 and represent management s best estimates of the impact of adopting ASC 606 at the time of the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	The actual impact of ASC 606 is subject to change from these estimates, pendi ng the completion of the Company s assessment during the first quarter of 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Company believes its Exhibitor s Services Agreement ( ESA ) with National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ) includes a significant financing component due to the length of time necessary to fulfill the performance obligations under the ESA as compared to the timing of receipt of the advanced payment.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	Similarly, the Company believes its Common Unit Adjustment ( CUA ) Agreement with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the receipt of common units in advance of the fulfillment of the performance obligations.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	As a result, the Company expects other revenues, specifically screen advertising revenues, will increase with a similar offsetting increase in noncash interest expense, but will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	In addition to recording the impact of significant financing components associated with its NCM ESA and CUA agreement, the Company has determined that based on how the performance obligations are fulfilled under these agreements, the related deferred revenues will be amortized on a straight-line basis under ASC 606 versus the units of revenue method followed prior to adoption of ASC 606.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	As a result of the change in amortization method, the Company expects to record a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment of no more than $55,000 in retained earnings effective January 1, 2018, with an offsetting decrease in deferred revenue - NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Company currently records online surcharges net of service fees as amounts have been immaterial.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	The Company has determined that it is the principal in the arrangement, and therefore, in accordance with ASC 606 guidance, the Company will recognize online surcharges in revenues on a gross basis and record all related service fees as an operating expense.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P65_S2	As a result of this change, the Company s other revenues and utilities and other costs will increase on a prospective basis, but will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Company currently has a domestic loyalty program that awards points to its members upon completion of various purchases and other transactions.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	Under ASC 606, the Company will have to defer a portion of the proceeds received from each purchase as a liability to provide future goods and services (or rewards in exchange for points) to program members.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	The Company expects this will result in slight reductions in admissions and concessions revenues with an offsetting increase in other long-term liabilities, but will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	The timing of revenue recognition for other revenue streams, including revenues for unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sales-type certificates, will also be impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, but we do not expect such changes to be material.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , ( ASU 2016-02 ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P68_S3	New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P68_S4	ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	The most significant impact of the amendments in ASU 2016-02 will be the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for assets currently subject to operating leases.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	The Company will adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Sha re-Based Payment Accounting , ( ASU 2016-09 ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of such activity on the statement of cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P71_S3	Prospective, retrospective, or modified retrospective application may be used depende nt on the specific requirements of the amendments within ASU 2016-09.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P71_S4	Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis (see Note 3).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P71_S5	As such, prior periods have not been adjusted.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force , ( ASU 2016-15 ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P72_S3	A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P72_S4	Upon adoption, the Company will reclassify $9,519 of cash payments recorded in loss on debt amendments and refinancing from operating activities to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P72_S5	The Company does not expect ASU 2016-15 to have any other material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , ( ASU 2017-04 ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P74_S2	The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2017-04 during the second quarter of 2017 in order to reduce the complexity of performing its goodwill impairment tests.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	As discussed in Note 1, these tests are generally performed in the fourth quarter of each year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Modification Accounting , ( ASU 2017-09 ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting as described in ASC Topic 718.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	ASU 2017-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	The Company does not expect ASU 2017-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , ( ASU 2017-12 ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	The amendments in ASU 2017-12 improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better reflect the economic results of an entity s risk management activities in its financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	Additionally, the amendments in ASU 2017-12 simplify certain steps of applying hedge accounting guidance.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P79_S4	The Company does not expect ASU 2017-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Company considers its unvested share based payment awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities, and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Basic earnings per share for the two classes of stock (common stock and unvested restricted stock) is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the potentially dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding determined under both the two class method and the treasury stock method.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	Effective January 1, 2017, the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	In accordance with the amendments in ASU 2016-09, the Company s diluted earnings per share calculation for the year ended December 31, 2017 excludes the estimated inc ome tax benefits and deficiencies in the application of the treasury stock method.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	Excess income tax benefits or deficiencies related to share based awards are recognized as discrete items in the income statement during the period in which they occur.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	See Note 14 for a discussion of share based awards and related income tax benefits recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	The following table presents computations of basic and diluted earnings per share under the two class method:
1385280_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	Below is a summary of dividends declared for the fiscal periods indicated.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Beginning with the dividend declared on February 24, 2016, the Company s board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.27 per common share.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	Beginning with the dividend declared on February 23, 2017, the Company s board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.29 per common share.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	The Company has an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement, or the ESA, with NCM, pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCMI ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	In connection with the NCMI initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA with NCMI.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior ESA, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to us by NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S4	In consideration for NCM s exclusive access to the Company s theatre attendees for on-screen advertising and use of off-screen areas within the Company s theatres for lobby entertainment and lobby promotions, the Company receives a monthly theatre access fee under the modified ESA.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S5	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron, initially seven cents, and a fixed payment per digital screen, which may be adjusted for certain reasons outlined in the modified ESA.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S6	The payment per theatre patron increases by 8% every five years, with the first such increase taking effect after the end of fiscal 2011, and the payment per digital screen, initially eight hundred dollars per digital screen per year, increases annually by 5%.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P87_S7	For 2015, 2016 and 2017, the annual payment per digital screen was one thousand one hundred eighty-two dollars, one thousand two hundred forty-one dollars and one thousand three hundred three dollars, respectively.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), AMC Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and the Company will not be less than 12% of NCM s Aggregate Advertising Revenue (as defined in the modified ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	Additionally, with respect to any on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire, the Company is required to purchase such time from NCM at a negotiated rate.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P88_S2	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 19 years.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	As a result of the application of a portion of the proceeds it received from the NCMI initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM, which is referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	Following the NCMI IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P89_S3	The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as Distributions from NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P89_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	Common Unit Adjustments Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCMI and the Company, AMC and Regal, which we refer to collectively as the Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, we follow the guidance in FASB ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S2	We concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S3	We evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in NCM and the assets exchanged for these additional units and have determined that the right to use our incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S4	We account for these additional common units, which we refer to herein as our Tranche 2 Investment, as a separate investment than our Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in our investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P90_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	undistributed equity earnings related to our Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of earnings in equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to our Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of our investment basis.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	In the event that a common unit ad justment is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member can elect to either transfer and surrender to NCM the number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member s common unit adjustment or to pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member s common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	If the Company then elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Tranche 2 Investment at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for Tranche 2 common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a gain or loss on sale of assets and other.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	Below is a summary of common units received by the Company under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:

1385280_18_ITEM1_P157_S1	The restricted stock units vest based on a combination of financial performance factors and continued service.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P157_S2	The financial performance factors are based on an implied equity value concept that determines an internal rate of return ( IRR ) for a two year measurement period, as defined in the award agreement, based on a formula utilizing a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA subject to certain specified adjustments (as defined in the restricted stock unit award agreement).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P157_S3	The financial performance factors for the restricted stock units have a threshold, target and maximum level of payment opportunity and vest on a prorata basis according to the IRR achieved by the Company during the performance period.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P157_S4	As an example, if the Company achieves an IRR equal to 11.0% for the 2015 grant, the number of restricted stock units that shall vest will be greater than the target but less than the maximum number that would have vested had the Company achieved the highest IRR.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P157_S5	All payouts of restricted stock units that vest will be subject to an additional service requirement and will be paid in the form of common stock if the participant continues to provide services through the fourth anniversary of the grant date.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P157_S6	The financial performance factors and respective vesting rates for each of the 2015, 2016 and 2017 grants are as follows:
1385280_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	At the time of each of the restricted stock unit grants, the Company assumes the IRR level to be reached for the defined measurement period will be the mid-point IRR level in determining the amount of compensation expense to record for such grants.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P158_S1	If and when additional information becomes available to indicate that something other than the mid-point IRR level will be achieved, the Company adjusts compensation expense on a prospective basis over the remaining service period.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P158_S2	The Company assumed a forfeiture rate of 5% for the restricted stock unit awards granted during 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	Restricted stock unit award participants are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments if and at the time the restricted stock unit awards vest.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P170_S4	While the Company s investment in foreign subsidiaries continues to be permanent in duration, the Company may periodically repatriate a portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur additional U.S. tax liability.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P170_S5	The Company considers any excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of its investment in its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P170_S6	At this time, the determination of deferred tax liabilities on this amount is not practicable.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P172_S4	The increase was a result of the Tax Act and its impact on the estimated usage of foreign tax credit carryforwards before their expiration.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P173_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017:

1385280_18_ITEM1_P175_S2	This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P176_S1	In addition to the minimum annual lease payments, some of the leases provide for contingent rentals based on operating results of the theatre and most require the payment of taxes, insurance and other costs applicable to the property.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P176_S2	The Company can renew, at its option, a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then market rental rates for various periods.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P176_S3	Some leases also provide for escalating rent payments throughout the lease term.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P176_S4	A liability for deferred lease expenses of $42,378 and $40,929 at December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively, has been provided to account for lease expenses on a straight-line basis, where lease payments are not made on such a basis.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P180_S2	The claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney General Act ( PAGA ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	representative action is appropriate, and is vigorously defending against the claims.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	The Company denies any violation of law and plans to vigorously defend against all claims.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	The Court determined that class certification is not appropriate and determined that a PAGA representative action is not appropriate.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P181_S3	The plaintiff has appealed these rulings.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P181_S4	The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal reversed portions of the ruling and re manded it back to the District Court.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P182_S0	The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P183_S0	Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert, LLC d/b/a Cinemas Palme D Or v. Century Theatres, Inc., and Cinemark USA, Inc.; Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles .
1385280_18_ITEM1_P183_S1	Plaintiff in this case alleges that the Company violated California antitrust and unfair competition laws by engaging in circuit dealing with various motion picture distributors and tortuously interfered with Plaintiff s business relationships.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P183_S2	Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, trebling of those damages under California law, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs and interest.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P183_S3	Plaintiff also alleges that the Company s conduct ultimately resulted in closure of its theatre in June 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S0	In 2008, the Company moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff s claims, arguing primarily that clearances between the theatres at issue were lawful and that Plaintiff lacked proof sufficient to support certain technical elements of its antitrust claims.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S1	The trial court granted that motion and dismissed Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S2	Plaintiff appealed and, in 2011, the Court of Appeal reversed, holding, among other things, that Plaintiff s claims were not about the illegality of clearances but were focused, instead, on circuit dealing.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S3	Having re-framed the claims in that manner, the Court of Appeal held that the trial court s decision to limit discovery to the market where the theatres at issue operated was an error, as circuit dealing necessarily involves activities in different markets.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S4	Upon return to the trial court, the parties engaged in additional, broadened discovery related to Plaintiff s circuit dealing claim.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S5	Thereafter, the Company moved again for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S6	That new motion for summary judgment was pending when, on or about April 11, 2014, the trial court granted the Company s motion for terminating sanctions and entered a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P184_S7	Plaintiff then appealed that second dismissal, seeking to have the judgment reversed and the case remanded to the trial court.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P185_S0	The Court of Appeal issued a ruling on May 24, 2016, reversing the granting of terminating sanctions and instead imposed a lesser evidentiary and damages preclusion sanction.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P185_S1	The case returned to the trial court on October 6, 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P185_S2	The Company has denied Plaintiff s allegations and is vigorously defending these claims.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P185_S3	The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P186_S0	The Company received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P186_S2	The Company also received CIDs from the Antitrust Section of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ohio and later from other states regarding similar inquiries under state antitrust laws.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P186_S3	The CIDs request the Company to answer interrogatories, and produce documents, or both, related to the investigation of matters including film clearances, potential coordination and/or communication with other major theatre circuits and related joint ventures.

1385280_18_ITEM1_P636_S0	Subscribed and sworn to before me this 23 rd day of February 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P637_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to the Company and will be retained by the Company and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P638_S0	This certification is provided pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, as added by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and accompanies the annual report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K ) for the year ended December 31, 2017 of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (the Issuer ).
1385280_18_ITEM1_P639_S0	I, Sean Gamble, the Chief Financial Officer of Issuer certify that to the best of my knowledge:
1385280_18_ITEM1_P640_S0	the information contained in the Form 10-K fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P641_S0	Subscribed and sworn to before me this 23 rd day of February 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM1_P642_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to the Company and will be retained by the Company and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our business depends on both the availability of suitable films for exhibition in our theatres and the success of those films in our markets.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Reduced volume of film releases, poor performance of films, the disruption in the production of films due to events such as a strike by directors, writers or actors, a reduction in financing options for the film distributors, or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the film distributors to promote their films could have an adverse effect on our business by resulting in fewer patrons and reduced revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our results of operations fluctuate on a seasonal basis.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our results of operations vary from period to period based upon the quantity and quality of the motion pictures that we show in our theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The major film distributors generally release the films they anticipate will be most successful during the summer and holiday seasons.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during these periods.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	The unexpected emergence of a successful film during other periods or the failure of an expected success at a key time could alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Due to the dependency on the success of films released from one period to the next, results of operations for one period may not be indicative of the results for the following period or the same period in the following year.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	A deterioration in relationships with film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We rely on the film distributors to supply the films shown in our theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with seven major film distributors accounting for approximately 89% of U.S. box office revenues and 49 of the top 50 grossing films during 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Numerous antitrust cases and consent decrees resulting from the antitrust cases impact the distribution of films.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Film distributors license films to exhibitors on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consequently, we cannot guarantee a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We are therefore required to negotiate licenses for each film and for each theatre.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the seven major film distributors could adversely affect our ability to obtain commercially successful films and to negotiate favorable licensing terms for such films, both of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We face intense competition for patrons and films which may adversely affect our business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors in many of our markets.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We compete for both patrons and licensing of films.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In markets where we do not face nearby competitive theatres, there is a risk of new theatres being built.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The degree of competition for patrons is dependent upon such factors as location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability, customer service quality, products and amenities offered, and ticket prices.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include the theatre s location and its demographics, the condition, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and licensing terms.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We also face competition from new concept theatres such as dine-in theatres and tavern style theatres that open in close proximity to our conventional theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S7	If we are unable to attract patrons or to license successful films, our business may be adversely affected.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S8	An increase in the use of alternative film distribution channels or other competing forms of entertainment may reduce movie theatre attendance and limit revenue growth.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S9	We face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S10	Some of these distribution channels have seen growth in production in recent years.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S11	We also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as family entertainment centers, concerts, theme parks, gaming and sporting events, for our patrons leisure time and disposable income.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S12	A significant increase in popularity of these alternative film distribution channels, competing forms of entertainment or improvements in technologies available at home could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S13	Our results of operations may be impacted by shrinking video and digital release windows.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S14	The average video and digital release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers at home, has decreased from six months to approximately ninety days over the past few years.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S15	If patrons choose to wait for an in-home release rather than attend a theatre to view the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S16	These release windows, which are determined by the studios, may shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S17	General political, social and economic conditions can adversely affect our attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S18	Our results of operations are dependent on general political, social and economic conditions, and the impact of such conditions on our theatre operating costs and on the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S19	If consumers discretionary income declines during a period of an economic downturn or political uncertainty, our operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S20	If theatre operating costs, such as utility costs, increase due to political or economic changes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S21	Political events, such as terrorist attacks, and health-related epidemics, such as flu outbreaks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P5_S22	In addition, a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, could impact our ability to operate certain of our theatres, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our foreign operations are subject to adverse regulations, economic instability and currency exchange risk.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We have 194 theatres with 1,398 screens in fifteen countries in Latin America.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Brazil represented approximately 11% of our consolidated 2017 revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Governmental regulation of the motion picture industry in foreign markets differs from that in the U.S. Changes in regulations affecting prices and quota systems requiring the exhibition of locally-produced films may adversely affect our international operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our international operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by our domestic operations, including risks of severe economic downturns and high inflation.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We also face risks of currency fluctuations, hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange and cash transfers to the U.S., all of which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	We have substantial long-term lease and debt obligations, which may restrict our ability to fund current and future operations and that restrict our ability to enter into certain transactions.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We have, and will continue to have, significant long-term debt service obligations and long-term lease obligations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,817.3 million in long-term debt obligations, $276.7 million in capital lease obligations and $1,747.5 million in long-term operating lease obligations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Our substantial lease and debt obligations pose risk by:
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business and competitive pressures and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our industry or the economy.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows and on our future financial results.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our ability to generate positive cash flows is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We may not be able to continue to generate cash flows at current levels, or guarantee that future borrowings will be available under our senior secured credit facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our lease and debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We may not be able to take any of these actions, and these actions may not be successful or permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations and these actions may be restricted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If we fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our leases and indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in them, we would be in default, and as a result, our debt holders would have the ability to require that we immediately repay our outstanding indebtedness and the lenders under our senior secured credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S8	If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P9_S10	If our debt holders require immediate payment, we may not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A failure to adapt to future technological innovations could impact our ability to compete effectively and could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While we continue to implement the latest technological innovations, such as motion seats and satellite distribution technologies, new technological innovations continue to impact our industry.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the technological preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We are subject to uncertainties relating to future expansion plans, including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new theatre site locations, and to obtain financing for such activities on favorable terms or at all.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We have greatly expanded our operations over the last decade through targeted worldwide theatre development and acquisitions.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We continue to pursue a strategy of expansion that will involve the development of new theatres and may involve acquisitions of existing theatres and theatre circuits both in the U.S. and internationally.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	There is significant competition for new site locations and for existing theatre and theatre circuit acquisition opportunities.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	As a result of such competition, we may not be able to acquire attractive site locations, existing theatres or theatre circuits on terms we consider acceptable.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	The pace of our growth may also be impacted by delays in site development caused by other parties.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Acquisitions and expansion opportunities may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of our business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Growth by acquisition also involves risks relating to difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our expansion strategy may not result in improvements to our business, financial condition, profitability, or cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Further, our expansion programs may require financing above our existing borrowing capacity and operating cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may not be able to obtain such financing or ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we do not comply with the ADA and the safe harbor framework included in the consent order we entered into with the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, we could be subject to further litigation.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA and analogous state and local laws.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Compliance with the ADA requires among other things that public facilities reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to commercial facilities conform to accessibility guidelines unless structurally impracticable for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	On November 15, 2004, Cinemark and the DOJ entered into a consent order, which was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Under the consent order, the DOJ approved a safe harbor framework for us to construct all of our future stadium-style movie theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The DOJ has stipulated that all theatres built in compliance with the consent order will comply with the wheelchair seating requirements of the ADA.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we fail to comply with the ADA, remedies could include imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards for damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy non-compliance.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Imposition of significant fines, damage awards or capital expenditures to cure non-compliance could adversely affect our business and operating results.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We may be subject to increased labor and benefits costs.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In the U.S., we are subject to United States federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We are also subject to union regulations in certain of our international markets, which can specify wage rates as well as minimum hours to be paid to certain employees.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	This in turn could lead us to increase prices, which could impact our sales.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	A credit market crisis may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and may materially impact our operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Severe dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the credit markets could materially impact our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P13_S8	The inability to access debt financing on reasonable terms could materially impact our ability to make acquisitions, invest in technology innovations or significantly expand our business in the future.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or otherwise restricted.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by our status as a holding company and the terms of our senior notes indentures, our senior subordinated notes indenture, and our senior secured credit facility, which restrict our ability to pay dividends and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, directly or indirectly, to us.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Under our debt instruments, we may pay a cash dividend up to a specified amount, provided we have satisfied certain financial covenants in, and are not in default under, our debt instruments.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The declaration of future dividends on our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, or Common Stock, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, limitations in our debt agreements and legal requirements.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Provisions in our corporate documents and certain agreements, as well as Delaware law, may hinder a change of control.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	provisions of Delaware law that restrict many business combinations and provide that directors serving on classified boards of directors, such as ours, may be removed only for cause.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Certain provisions of our 4.875% senior notes indenture and our 5.125% senior notes indenture and our senior secured credit facility may have the effect of delaying or preventing future transactions involving a change of control.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	A change of control would require us to make an offer to the holders of each of our 4.875% senior notes and our 5.125% senior notes to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	A change of control would also be an event of default under our senior secured credit facility.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Future sales of our Common Stock may adversely affect the prevailing market price.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If a large number of shares of our Common Stock is sold in the open market, or if there is a perception that such sales will occur, the trading price of our Common Stock could decrease.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional Common Stock.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of 170,613,555 shares of our Common Stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for specific purposes.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In general, we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We may issue shares of our Common Stock in connection with acquisitions.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S9	As of December 31, 2017, we had 116,475,033 shares of our Common Stock outstanding.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Of these shares, approximately 105,665,090 shares were freely tradable.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S11	The remaining shares of our Common Stock were restricted securities as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Restricted securities may not be resold in a public distribution except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption therefrom, including the exemptions provided by Regulation S and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Common Stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by any of our large stockholders, our directors or executive officers of their shares of Common Stock.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2017, there were 7,980,476 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Recently, there has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities for our vendors and for us which would result in higher operating costs for the Company.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Also, compliance of our theatres and accompanying real estate with new and revised environmental, zoning, land-use or building codes, laws, rules or regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	However, we are unable to predict at this time, the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	We may be subject to liability under environmental laws and regulations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We own and operate a large number of theatres and other properties within the U.S. and internationally, which may be subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment or human health.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Such environmental laws and regulations include those that impose liability for the investigation and remediation of spills or releases of hazardous materials.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S9	We may incur such liability, including for any currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, or for any site, to which we may have disposed, or arranged for the disposal of, hazardous materials or wastes.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability, including on a joint and several liability, which can result in a liable party being obliged to pay for greater than its share, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Environmental conditions relating to our properties or operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Cyber security threats and our failure to protect our electronically stored data could adversely affect our business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We collect, use, store and maintain electronic information and data necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information of the company, our customers, and our employees.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We also rely on the availability of information technology systems to operate our business, including for communications, receiving and displaying movies, ticketing, guest services, payments, and other general operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We rely on some of our vendors to store and process certain data and to manage, host, and/or provide some of our information technology systems.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Because of the scope and complexity of our information technology systems, our reliance on vendors to provide, support and protect our systems and data, and the constantly evolving cyber-threat landscape, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of disruption, failure, unauthorized access, cyber-terrorism, human error, misuse, tampering, theft, and other cyber-attacks.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	These or similar events, whether accidental or intentional, could result in theft, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, which could harm our reputation or result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other costs, fines, investigations, enforcement actions or lawsuits.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S7	These or similar events could also lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems resulting in business impact, including loss of business.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Those same scope, complexity, reliance, and changing cyber-threat landscape factors could also affect our ability to adapt to and comply with changing regulations and contractual obligations applicable to data security and privacy, which are increasingly demanding, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S9	In order to address these risks, we have adopted security measures and technology, operate a security program, and work continuously to evaluate and improve our security posture.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S10	However, the development and maintenance of these systems and programs are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P20_S11	As such, there can be no assurance that these or similar events will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In addition to Company-specific cyber threats or events, our business and results of operations could also be impacted by cyber-related events affecting our peers and partners within the entertainment industry, as well as other retail companies.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We maintain insurance designed to provide coverage for cyber risks related to what we believe to be adequate and collectible insurance in the event of the theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data, but the foregoing events or future events could result in costs and business impacts which may not be covered or may be in excess of any available insurance that we may have procured.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As a result, future events could have a material impact on our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Product recalls and associated costs c ould adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	W e may be found liable if the consumption of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We are also subject to recall by product manufacturers or if the food products become contaminated.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Recalls could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of the product and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Changes in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our cinemas rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Any expansion on existing and/or new laws and regulations regarding marketing, solicitation or data protection could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our email and other marketing techniques and could result in changes to our marketing strategy which could adversely impact our attendance levels and revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	We are subject to complex taxation and could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We are subject to many different forms of taxation both in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P22_S9	The tax authorities may not agree with the determinations that we made and such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts for tax, interest and penalties, which could have a material impact on our results.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Additionally, current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If the Company s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company s taxes owed in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may not be able to generate additional revenues or continue to realize value from our investment in NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we owned 27,871,862 common units of NCM, which represented an ownership interest in NCM of approximately 18%.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	We receive a monthly theatre access fee under our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM and we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Company received approximately $11.3 million, $11.0 million and $11.3 million in other revenues from NCM, respectively, $18.1 million, $14.7 million and $16.4 million in cash distributions recorded as a reduction of our investment in NCM, respectively, and $18.1 million $14.7 million, $16.4 million in cash distributions in excess of our investment in NCM, respectively.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Cinema advertising is a small component of the U.S. advertising market and therefore, NCM competes with larger, more established and well known media platforms such as broadcast radio and television, cable and satellite television, outdoor advertising and Internet portals.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In-theatre advertising may not continue to attract advertisers or NCM s in-theatre advertising format may not continue to be received favorably by theatre patrons.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If NCM is unable to continue to generate consistent advertising revenues, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and distributions and revenues from NCM may be adversely impacted.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Each of our common units in NCM is convertible into one share of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of our investment in NCM was approximately $191.2 million based on NCM, Inc. s stock price as of December 31, 2017 of $6.86 per share, which was less than our carrying value of $200.6 million.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We do not believe that the decline in NCM, Inc. s stock price is other than temporary and therefore, we did not record an impairment of our investment in NCM during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The market value of NCM, Inc. s stock price may continue to vary due to the performance of the business, industry trends, general and economic conditions and other factors.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If NCM, Inc. s stock price continues to decline or stays at a level below our carrying value for an extended period of time, we may record an impairment in our investment.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We are subject to impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have a significant amount of long-lived assets.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment at the theatre level, therefore if a theatre is directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or condition of the areas surrounding the theatre, we may record impairment charges to reflect the decline in estimated fair value of that theatre.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We also have a significant amount of goodwill and tradename intangible assets.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our attendance due to increased competition in certain regions and/or countries or economic factors that lead to a decline in attendance in any given region or country could result in impairments of goodwill and our intangible assets.
1385280_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we performed quantitative analyses on all of our goodwill and tradename intangible assets and determined that the fair values of such assets are not below their respective carrying values.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2017, in the U.S., we operated 298 theatres with 3,953 screens pursuant to leases and own the land and building for 41 theatres with 608 screens.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our leases are generally entered into on a long-term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 20 to 45 years.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 8% of our theatre leases in the U.S., covering 24 theatres with 190 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of less than six years.

1385280_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	The leases generally provide for a fixed monthly minimum rent payment, with certain leases also subject to additional percentage rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We currently own an office building in Plano, Texas, which is our worldwide headquarters.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	We lease office space in Frisco, Texas and McKinney, Texas for theatre support and maintenance personnel.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	International As of December 31, 2017, internationally, we operated 194 theatres with 1,398 screens, all of which are leased.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our international leases are generally entered into on a long term basis with terms, including optional renewal periods, generally ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S2	The leases generally provide for contingent rental based upon operating results with an annual minimum.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2017, approximately 13% of our international theatre leases, covering 25 theatres with 220 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of less than six years.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S4	Approximately 49% of our international theatre leases, covering 96 theatres and 708 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of between six and 15 years and approximately 38% of our international theatre leases, covering 73 theatres and 470 screens, have remaining terms, including optional renewal periods, of more than 15 years.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S5	The leases generally provide for a fixed monthly minimum rent payment, with certain leases also subject to additional percentage rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S6	We also lease office space in seven regions in Latin America for our local management.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S7	See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our minimum lease commitments.
1385280_18_ITEM2_P2_S8	We periodically review the profitability of each of our theatres, particularly those whose lease terms are nearing expiration, to determine whether to continue its operations.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert, LLC d/b/a Cinemas Palme D Or v. Century Theatres, Inc., and Cinemark USA, Inc.; Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles .
1385280_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	Plaintiff in this case alleges that the Company violated California antitrust and unfair competition laws by engaging in circuit dealing with various motion picture distributors and tortuously interfered with Plaintiff s business relationships.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages, trebling of those damages under California law, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs and interest.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	Plaintiff also alleges that our conduct ultimately resulted in closure of its theatre in June 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	In 2008, we moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff s claims, arguing primarily that clearances between the theatres at issue were lawful and that Plaintiff lacked proof sufficient to support certain technical elements of its antitrust claims.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	The trial court granted that motion and dismissed Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	Plaintiff appealed and, in 2011, the Court of Appeal reversed, holding, among other things, that Plaintiff s claims were not about the illegality of clearances but were focused, instead, on circuit dealing.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S3	Having re-framed the claims in that manner, the Court of Appeal held that the trial court s decision to limit discovery to the market where the theatres at issue operated was an error, as circuit dealing necessarily involves activities in different markets.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S4	Upon return to the trial court, the parties engaged in additional, broadened discovery related to Plaintiff s circuit dealing claim.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S5	Thereafter, we moved again for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff s claims.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S6	That new motion for summary judgment was pending when, on or about April 11, 2014, the trial court granted the Company s motion for terminating sanctions and entered a judgment dismissing the case with prejudice.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P1_S7	Plaintiff then appealed that second dismissal, seeking to have the judgment reversed and the case remanded to the trial court.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Court of Appeal issued a ruling on May 24, 2016, reversing the granting of terminating sanctions and instead imposed a lesser evidentiary and damages preclusion sanction.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	The case returned to the trial court on October 6, 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	We have denied Plaintiff s allegations and are vigorously defending these claims.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	We are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation or the range of potential loss.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S4	We received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S5	The CID relates to an investigation under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P2_S6	We also received CIDs from the Antitrust Section of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ohio and later from other states regarding similar inquiries under state antitrust laws.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	The CIDs request us to answer interrogatories, and produce documents, or both, related to the investigation of matters including film clearances, potential coordination and/or communication with other major theatre circuits and related joint ventures.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	We intend to fully cooperate with all federal and state government agencies.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P3_S2	Although we do not believe that it has violated any federal or state antitrust or competition laws, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P3_S3	From time to time, we are involved in other various legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business operations, such as personal injury claims, employment matters, landlord-tenant disputes, patent claims and contractual disputes, some of which are covered by insurance or by indemnification from vendors.
1385280_18_ITEM3_P3_S4	We believe our potential liability with respect to these types of proceedings currently pending is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the years indicated.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of Common Stock As of December 31, 2017, there were 440 holders of record of the Company s common stock and there were no other classes of stock issued and outstanding.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividend Policy Below is a summary of dividends declared for the fiscal periods indicated:
1385280_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	We, at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P3_S1	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P3_S2	See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities for a discussion of dividend restrictions under our debt agreements.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Performance Graph The performance graph is incorporated by reference to the Company s proxy statement for its annual stockholders meeting to be held on May 24, 2018 and to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after December 31, 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the Company s long-term compensation plan is incorporated by reference to the Company s proxy statement for its annual stockholders meeting to be held on May 24, 2018 and to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after December 31, 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	For the purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings consist of income from continuing operations before taxes plus fixed charges excluding capitalized interest.
1385280_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	Fixed charges consist of interest expense, capitalized interest, amortization of debt issue costs and that portion of rental expense which we believe to be representative of the interest factor.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Revenues and Expenses We generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	NCM provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in theatre advertising.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2017 included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Wonder Woman, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider Man: Homecoming, It, Thor: Ragnarok, Despicable Me 3, Logan, The Fate of the Furious, Justice League, Dunkirk, Coco, The LEGO Batman Movie, Get Out, The Boss Baby, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Kong: Skull Island, Hidden Figures, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and other films.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Mission Impossible 6, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, and Ant-Man and the Wasp , among other films.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and renovated theatres and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs , repairs, maintenance and security services.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	General administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consists of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, professional fees, audit fees, general supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	As such, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results, include the following: Revenue and Expense Recognition Revenues are recognized when admissions and concession sales are received at the box office.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	Other revenues primarily consist of screen advertising.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	Screen advertising revenues are recognized over the period that the related advertising is delivered on-screen or in-theatre.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S6	We record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admissions or concession revenue when a holder redeems the card or certificate.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P9_S7	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue only after such a period of time indicates, based on historical experience, the likelihood of redemption is remote, and based on applicable laws and regulations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	In evaluating the likelihood of redemption, we consider the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	See Impact of Recent Accounting Developments below.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Film rental costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and either firm terms or a sliding scale formula, which are generally established prior to the opening of the film, or estimates of the final settlement rate, which occurs at the conclusion of the film run, subject to the film licensing arrangement.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Under a firm terms formula, we pay the distributor a percentage of box office receipts, which reflects either an aggregate rate for the life of the film or rates that decline over the term of the run.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	Under a sliding scale formula, we pay a percentage of box office revenues using a pre-determined matrix that is based upon box office performance of the film.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	The settlement process allows for negotiation of film rental fees upon the conclusion of the film run based upon how the film performs.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Estimates are based on the expected success of a film.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The success of a film can typically be determined a few weeks after a film is released when initial box office performance of the film is known.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	If actual settlements are different than those estimates, film rental costs are adjusted at that time.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S5	Certain of our leases are subject to monthly percentage rent only, which is accrued each month based on actual revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S6	Certain of our other theatres require payment of percentage rent in addition to fixed monthly rent if an annual target revenue level is achieved.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S7	Percentage rent expense is estimated and recorded for these theatres on a monthly basis if the theatre s historical performance or forecasted performance indicates that the annual target revenue level will be reached.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P13_S8	Once annual revenues are known, which is generally at the end of the year, the percentage rent expense is adjusted at that time.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We record the fixed minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Theatre properties and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	In estimating the useful lives of our theatre properties and equipment, we have relied upon our experience with such assets and our historical replacement period.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions and adjust them as necessary.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Adjustments to the expected lives of assets are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Leasehold improvements for which we pay and to which we have title are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the lease term.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	We also perform a full quantitative impairment evaluation on an annual basis.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:
1385280_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The remainder of the theatre s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee owned properties.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2015, 2016 and 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We adopted ASU 2017-04 Intangibles Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment effective for our annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during 2017, which required us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	During 2017, we performed a quantitative tradename impairment assessment for each tradename asset, which included comparing their carrying values to an estimated fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	We estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management s estim ates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company s t radename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Income Taxes We use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	Deferred income taxes are provided when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Income taxes are provided on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries unless such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	Income taxes have also been provided for potential tax assessments.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position would be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements result in (1) a change in a liability for income taxes payable or (2) a change in an income tax refund receivable, a deferred tax asset or a deferred tax liability or both (1) and (2).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	We accrue interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	See Impact of Recent Accounting Developments below.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements We have an investment in NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement ( ESA ), pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company s theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company s sale of certain of its shares in NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM's future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Me mbers, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losse s.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in N ational CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S5	The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S6	The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S7	The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and dist ributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P39_S8	See Impact of Recent Accounting Developments below.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Developments Impact of New Revenue Recognition Standard In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , ( ASC 606 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	ASC 606 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	ASC 606 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	We adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	The new standard will therefore be applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	While we do not believe the adoption of ASC 606 will have a material impact to our results of operations or cash flows, we do expect ASC 606 to have an impact on the classification of certain revenues and related expenses, as summarized below.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Quantitative amounts included below are estimates of the expected effects of our adoption of ASC 606 and represent management s best estimates of the impact of adopting ASC 606 at the time of the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	The actual impact of ASC 606 is subject to change from these estimates, pending the completion of our assessment during the first quarter of 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	We believe our Exhibitor s Services Agreement ( ESA ) with National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ) includes a significant financing component due to the length of time necessary to fulfill the performance obligations under the ESA as compared to the timing of receipt of the advanced payment.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	Similarly, we believe our Common Unit Adjustment ( CUA ) Agreement with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the receipt of common units in advance of the fulfillment of the performance obligations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	As a result, we expect other revenues, specifically screen advertising revenues, will increase with a similar offsetting increase in noncash interest expense, but will not have a material impact on our results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	In addition to recording the impact of significant financing components associated wi th our NCM ESA and CUA agreement, we have determined that based on how the performance obligations are fulfilled under these agreements, the related deferred revenues will be amortized on a straight-line basis under ASC 606 versus the units of revenue meth od followed prior to adoption of ASC 606.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result of the change in amortization method, we expect to record a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment of no more than $55 million in retained earnings effective January 1, 2018, with an offsett ing decrease in deferred revenue - NCM.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	We currently record online surcharges net of service fees as amounts have been immaterial.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	We have determined that we are the principal in the arrangement, and therefore, in accordance with ASC 606 guidance, we will recognize online surcharges in revenues on a gross basis and record all related service fees as an operating expense.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a result of this change, our other revenues and utilities and other costs will increase on a prospective basis, but will not have a material impact on our results of operations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We currently have a domestic loyalty program that awards points to our members upon completion of various purchases and other transactions.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Under ASC 606, we will have to defer a portion of the proceeds received from each purchase as a liability to provide future goods and services (or rewards in exchange for points) to program members.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	We expect this will result in slight reductions in admissions and concessions revenues with an offsetting increase in other long-term liabilities, but will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	The timing of revenue recognition for other revenue streams, including revenues for unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sales-type certificates, will also be impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, but we do not expect such changes to be material.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Impact of Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and included a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	We recorded a net one-time benefit of $44.9 million, all non-cash, related to enactment of the Tax Act, including a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, a reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings, a deemed repatriation tax, and a reduction in a deferred tax asset with regard to foreign tax credit carryforwards.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	While we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such effects, the net one-time charge related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to: further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. government.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net income from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	Recent Developments On February 22, 2018, our board of directors approved an increase to our annual dividend of approximately 10%, to $1.28 per common share.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	The cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.32 per share of common stock is payable to stockholders of record on March 8, 2018, and will be paid on March 22, 2018.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts for certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income along with each of those items as a percentage of revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	All costs are expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except film rentals and advertising, which are expressed as a percentage of admissions revenues and concession supplies, which are expressed as a percentage of concession revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Compari son of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 Revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Total revenues increased $72.8 million to $2,991.6 million for 2017 from $2,918.8 million for 2016, representing a 2.5% increase.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenue and attendance amounts in millions.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Admissions revenues decreased $22.1 million primarily due to a 4.5% decrease in attendance, partially offset by a 3.0% increase in average ticket price.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Concession revenues increased $25.5 million primarily due to an 8.1% increase in concession revenues per patron, partially offset by the 4.5% decrease in attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	The decrease in attendance was due to a slate of films in 2017 that had weaker consumer appeal compared to 2016, partially offset by the favorable impact of luxury lounger conversions and new theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P57_S4	The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales, expanded offerings, price increases and new theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Admissions revenues increased $27.9 million as reported, primarily due to an 8.9% increase in average ticket price, partially offset by a 1.9% decrease in attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Admissions revenues increased $16.5 million in constant currency, primarily due to a 6.1% increase in constant currency average ticket price, partially offset by the 1.9% decrease in attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	Concession revenues increased $23.2 million as reported, primarily due to a 12.0% increase in concession revenues per patron, partially offset by the 1.9% decrease in attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	Concession revenues increased $17.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to a 9.7% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron, partially offset by the 1.9% decrease in attendance.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	The decrease in attendance was due to a slate of films in 2017 that had weaker consumer appeal compared to 2016, partially offset by the impact of new theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S5	Average ticket price and concession revenues per patron increased primarily due to price increases, which were predominantly driven by local inflation.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P58_S6	Other revenues increased primarily due to increased promotional income and incremental screen advertising revenues generated by an expansion of our Flix Media services to affiliates in various countries .
1385280_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The tabl e below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time.

1385280_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Salaries and wages increased to $265.8 million for 2017 from $248.2 million for 2016 primarily due to incremental staffing at new and recently remodeled theatres, increases in minimum wages and increased staffing for food and beverage initiatives.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Facility lease expense increased to $241.0 million for 2017 from $240.7 million for 2016 due to the impact of new theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	Utilities and other costs decreased to $241.6 million for 2017 from $250.9 million for the 2016 period.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	The decrease was primarily due to the change in classification of transactional fees and decreased equipment lease expenses for 3-D presentations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Salaries and wages increased to $88.7 million ($88.2 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $77.6 million for 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The as reported increase was due to increased local currency wage rates primarily due to inflation, new theatres and limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Facility lease expense increased to $87.2 million ($84.6 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $80.6 million for 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	The as reported increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate and new theatres.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P63_S4	Utilities and other costs increased to $113.4 million ($111.6 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $105.0 million for 2016.

1385280_18_ITEM7_P131_S4	Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis (see Note 3).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P131_S5	As such, prior periods have not been adjusted.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force , ( ASU 2016-15 ).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P132_S3	A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P132_S4	Upon adoption, we will reclassify $9,519 of cash payments recorded in loss on debt amendments and refinancing from operating activities to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P132_S5	We do not expect ASU 2016-15 to have any other material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , ( ASU 2017-04 ).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P134_S2	We adopted the amendments in ASU 2017-04 during the second quarter of 2017 in order to reduce the complexity of performing its goodwill impairment tests.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	As discussed in Note 1, these tests are generally performed in the fourth quarter of each year.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Modification Accounting , ( ASU 2017-09 ).
1385280_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting as described in ASC Topic 718.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P137_S2	The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	ASU 2017-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P138_S1	We do not expect ASU 2017-09 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

1385280_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	The amendments in ASU 2017-12 improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better reflect the economic results of an entity s risk management activities in its financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P139_S2	Additionally, the amendments in ASU 2017-12 simplify certain steps of applying hedge accounting guidance.

1385280_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	We do not expect ASU 2017-12 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	Seasonality Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P141_S1	Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during summer months in the U.S., extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from November through year-end.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P141_S2	The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P141_S3	In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P141_S4	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend.
1385280_18_ITEM7_P141_S5	The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate Risk We are currently party to variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt facilities.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At December 31, 2017, there was an aggregate of approximately $659.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding under these facilities.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $6.6 million.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of December 31, 2017:
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Amounts are presented before adjusting for debt issuance costs.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Generally, we export from the U.S. certain of the equipment and interior finish items and other operating supplies used by our international subsidiaries.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A majority of the revenues and operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are transacted in the country s local currency.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	If our subsidiaries operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency for the subsidiary, which could impact future results of operations as reported.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments.
1385280_18_ITEM7A_P3_S5	Based upon our equity ownership in our international subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, holding everything else constant, a 10% immediate, simultaneous, unfavorable change in all of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed, would decrease the aggregate net book value of our investments in our international subsidiaries by approximately $51 million and would decrease the aggregate net income of our international subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2017 by $11 million, respectively.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2017, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control framework and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) .

1385280_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report.

1385280_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Limitations on Controls Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or fraud.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met.
1385280_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P0_S0	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGI STERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cinemark Holdings, Inc.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S0	Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S2	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P1_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1385280_18_ITEM9B_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1385280_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
