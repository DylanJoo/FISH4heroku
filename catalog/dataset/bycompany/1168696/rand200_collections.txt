1168696_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	We operate multi-screen theatres and have an average of 12.4 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry 2009 average of 6.6 screens per location.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the U.S. with a national footprint representing approximately 16.9% of total U.S. screens as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company's fiscal year ends on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2008) results in a 53-week fiscal year.

1168696_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Key elements of our business strategy include:
1168696_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 30, 2010, we have returned approximately $3.1 billion to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction that meets our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	We also intend to enhance our theatre operations by selectively expanding and upgrading existing properties in prime locations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition, we will continue to expand our loyalty program and create new strategic interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and to enhance our food and beverage offerings.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	We continue to embrace new technologies to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts:
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	During fiscal 2010, the Company focused on an accelerated deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres and expects to continue the accelerated 3D deployment into the first half of 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	As of December 30, 2010, we operated 2,202 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 1,710 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	We expect all of our screens to be outfitted with digital projection systems by late 2012 or early 2013, with approximately 40% of our total screens being digital 3D capable by mid-2011.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	Second, we renegotiated our agreement with IMAX during fiscal 2010 to expand our IMAX footprint by agreeing to install a total of up to 77 IMAX digital projection systems by the end of 2012.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	We believe that expanding our IMAX footprint, combined with a more favorable allocation of costs included in the new agreement, will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S5	Finally, as of December 30, 2010, we had converted seven of our auditoriums to our proprietary large screen format known as "Regal Premium Experience" ("RPX (SM) ").
1168696_11_ITEM1_P12_S6	We have been encouraged by the initial results of RPX (SM) and expect to expand our RPX (SM) footprint by converting up to 12 additional auditoriums throughout 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe the installation of 3D digital projection systems and IMAX theatres systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to RPX (SM) auditoriums allow us to offer our patrons premium 3D movie and large all-digital format experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with 3D film product and other 3D content and are pleased to see continued support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions that enhance our asset base and improve our consolidated operating results.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatres assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities:
1168696_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	We are the largest domestic motion picture exhibitor operating 6,698 screens in 539 theatres in 37 states and the District of Columbia.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation opportunities.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We have developed a proven operating philosophy focused on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	At the corporate level, we are able to capitalize on our size and operational expertise to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to control costs effectively and increase concession sales.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Since our 2002 initial public offering, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of seven theatre circuits, consisting of 157 theatres and 1,808 screens.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have generally achieved immediate cost savings at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	As of December 30, 2010, approximately 81% of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating and approximately 86% of our screens were located in theatres with 10 or more screens.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	Our theatres have an average of 12.4 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry 2009 average of 6.6 screens per location.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	We believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P21_S4	We believe that our theatre circuit will be further enhanced with the installation of digital projection systems in our theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre network in North America representing approximately 17,300 U.S. and Canadian theatres screens (of which 15,700 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of September 30, 2010 and reaching over 640 million movie guests annually.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	National CineMedia utilizes its in-theatre digital content network to distribute pre-feature advertising, cinema and lobby advertising and entertainment programming content.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe our investment in National CineMedia will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	In addition, on December 30, 2010, Regal paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.40 per share on each outstanding share of its Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $216.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Further, on February 9, 2011, we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2011 to our stockholders of record on March 3, 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	This dividend reflects a $0.03 per share increase from the Company's last quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share declared on October 28, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S4	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S5	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S6	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P25_S7	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our board of directors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and, consequently, box office revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	We expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	More recently, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering films to consumers, including cable television, in-home video and DVD, satellite and pay-per-view services and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its in-home video or DVD release has remained relatively stable.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P28_S4	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	The domestic motion picture industry is in the process of converting from film-based media to electronic-based media, including the distribution of feature films in a digital format rather than a 35 mm film format.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Virtually all entertainment content today can be exhibited digitally.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	Digital projection produces a consistent state-of-the-art presentation for patrons as there is no degradation of image over the exhibition period of the motion picture.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that operating a digital theatre circuit has enabled us to generate incremental revenue from differentiated motion picture formats such as digital 3D, IMAX and RPX (SM) , generate additional revenue from exhibition of specialty content offerings and provide greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which we expect will enhance our capacity utilization.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	Given our market presence, the overall diversity of our patron base and our high average screen per theatre count, we believe the benefits associated with digital technologies will be significant for our theatre circuit and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P29_S5	We remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with 3D film product and other 3D content and are pleased to see growing support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	increase in alternative content available to us.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	As directors and producers continue to embrace new technology in their productions, we expect new and innovative content generation to continue.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	To that end, on February 12, 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, formed Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), to create a financing model and execute agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S3	During fiscal 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S4	During fiscal 2010, the Company focused on an accelerated deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres and expects to continue the accelerated 3D deployment into the first half of 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S5	As of December 30, 2010, we operated 2,202 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 1,710 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P30_S6	See "Digital Cinema Implementation Partners Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this joint venture arrangement.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	We believe a modern megaplex featuring stadium seating is preferred by patrons over a sloped-floor multiplex theatre, the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	We believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	We also believe that another evolution of theatre formats beyond the current megaplex is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	We operate the largest theatre circuit in the United States with 6,698 screens in 539 theatres in 37 states and the District of Columbia as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	We operate theatres in 43 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas, which include locations in suburban growth areas.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Edwards brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, many of our theatres feature state-of-the-art amenities such as immersive wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling screens, Sony Digital Cinema 4K projection systems, digital stereo surround-sound, closed-captioning, multi-station concessions stands, computerized ticketing systems, plush stadium seating with cup holders and retractable armrests, enhanced interiors and exteriors and video game areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	We believe that our theatre circuit will be further enhanced with the installation of digital projection systems.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe that operating a digital theatre circuit will enable us to generate incremental revenue from differentiated motion picture formats such as digital 3D, IMAX and RPX SM , generate additional revenue from exhibition of specialty content offerings and provide greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which we expect will enhance our capacity utilization.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot and reducing the cost per square foot of operation.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enables us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising and rent, over a higher revenue base.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	We stagger movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and lobby congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P35_S4	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P35_S5	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, self-reserved seating and themed gift cards and e-gift cards.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state and the District of Columbia as of December 30, 2010:
1168696_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	We have implemented a best management practices program across all of our theatres, including daily, weekly and monthly management reports generated for each individual theatre and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers regularly inspect each theatre.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	We also operate a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	In March 2005, Regal and AMC announced the combination of the operations of RCM and AMC's subsidiary, National Cinema Network, Inc. ("NCN"), into a joint venture company known as National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	In July 2005, Cinemark, through a wholly owned subsidiary, joined the National CineMedia joint venture.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Since its inception, National CineMedia has primarily concentrated its efforts on in-theatre advertising, business meetings and non-feature film content distribution.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), a newly formed entity that serves as the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	In connection with the IPO of NCM, Inc., RCM, through its wholly owned subsidiary Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC ("RCH"), AMC and Cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of National CineMedia and other ancillary agreements.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	In connection with the series of transactions completed in connection with the IPO, Regal received gross cash proceeds totaling approximately $628.3 million and retained a 22.6% interest in NCM, Inc.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P43_S3	After the payment of current taxes, net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled approximately $447.4 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	As described more fully in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on April 9, 2008, March 17, 2009 and March 17, 2010 we received from National CineMedia approximately 0.8 million, 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	In addition, on May 29, 2008, we received from National CineMedia approximately 2.9 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement in connection with our acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	On August 18, 2010, we redeemed 4.2 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $13.7 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	We received approximately $64.5 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $50.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S4	In addition, on September 8, 2010, we redeemed an additional 0.1 million National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock and sold them to the underwriters to cover over-allotments at $16.00 per share, further reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $0.3 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S5	We received approximately $1.5 million of net proceeds from this sale, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.2 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S6	These transactions, together with National CineMedia's issuance of 6.5 million common units to AMC in the second quarter of 2010 as a result of an acquisition, had the effect of decreasing the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S7	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.4% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P44_S8	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	On February 12, 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, formed DCIP to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema in our theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	Concurrent with closing, the Company entered into a master equipment lease agreement (the "Master Lease") and other related agreements (collectively, the "Digital Cinema Agreements") with Kasima, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	Upon execution of the Digital Cinema Agreements, the Company made equity contributions to DCIP of approximately $41.7 million, consisting of $29.1 million in cash and 200 existing digital projection systems with a fair value of approximately $12.6 million (collectively, the "DCIP Contributions").
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	The Company recorded such DCIP Contributions as an increase in its investment in DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S5	In connection with the contribution of its 200 existing digital projection systems, the Company recorded a loss on the contribution of $2.0 million based on the excess of the carrying value of the digital projection systems contributed over the $12.6 million fair value (as determined by an independent appraisal) of such equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S6	In addition, during May 2010, Regal sold an additional 337 digital projection systems to DCIP for aggregate proceeds of approximately $20.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S7	In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of approximately $2.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S8	After giving effect to the DCIP Contributions, the Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 30, 2010, while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P45_S9	Since the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it will continue to account for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	The costs of implementing digital projection in our theatres will be substantially funded by DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	We expect DCIP to fund the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	We will bear operating and maintenance costs with respect to digital projection systems in our theatres, which we expect to be relatively comparable to what we currently spend on our conventional film projectors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	In accordance with the Master Lease, the digital projection systems are leased from Kasima, LLC under a twelve-year term with ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P46_S4	The Master Lease also contains a fair value purchase option.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Under the Master Lease, the Company pays annual minimum rent of $1,000 per digital projection system for the first six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement and is, upon certain conditions, subject to minimum annual rent of $3,000 per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the Master Lease.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P47_S3	The Company accounts for the Master Lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	The initial financing is expected to cover the cost of conversion to digital projection for approximately 70% of our circuit's screens.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	We ultimately expect to outfit our entire circuit with digital projection systems by late 2012 or early 2013, with approximately 40% of our total screens being digital 3D capable by mid-2011.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	As of December 30, 2010, we operated 2,202 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 1,710 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including in-home video and DVD, cable television, broadcast television and satellite, pay-per-view services and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	strong opening run at the theatre can help establish a film's success and substantiate the film's revenue potential.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	For example, the value of home video, DVD and pay cable distribution agreements frequently depends on the success of a film's theatrical release.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P55_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	In zones where there is competition, a distributor will allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	Under the firm term formula, the exhibitor and distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	Lastly, under the review or settlement method, the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	These negotiations typically involve the use of historical settlements or past precedent.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P61_S2	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	For fiscal 2010, ten major film distributors accounted for approximately 96% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	Five of the ten major film distributors each accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2010 admission revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	No single film distributor accounted for more than 20% of fiscal 2010 admissions revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	individual distributors will vary widely depending upon the number and popularity of films that each one distributes.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 25.8% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P66_S3	Our management negotiates directly with manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	ability to secure films with favorable licensing terms; availability of stadium seating, location, reputation and seating capacity; quality of projection and sound systems; and ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	We have several hundred competitors nationwide, which vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	Our competitors, including newly established motion picture exhibitors, may build new theatres or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P69_S3	If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P69_S4	As the largest motion picture exhibitor, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels, including home video and DVD, cable television, broadcast television and satellite, pay-per-view services and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Other technologies such as video on demand could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	When motion picture distributors licensed their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrained from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	The theatrical release window has been stable over the past five to six years.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	To market our theatres, we utilize Internet, newspaper and radio advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	grouping for all of our theatres located in a newspaper's circulation area.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	In many of our markets we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	We have a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , in all of our markets and it is the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	As of December 30, 2010, we had over six million active members in the Regal Crown Club .
1168696_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P75_S4	We offer these programs only in selected markets.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P75_S5	We plan to use these programs in markets where we believe patron loyalty can be further enhanced, and we will continue to evaluate our markets on a case-by-case basis to determine the suitability of these programs in individual regions.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	We make extensive use of information technology ("IT") for the management of our business, our theatres, and other revenue generating operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery stores and mass discounters and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	We continue to expand our ability to sell tickets remotely by using our Internet ticketing partner, Fandango.com, and by deploying self-service customer activated terminals ("CATs") in appropriate theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	The CATs can sell tickets for current and future shows and provide the capability to retrieve tickets purchased through Fandango.com.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P77_S4	We continue to invest in IT to improve services to our patrons and provide information to our management, allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	Our scheduling systems support the coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events of National CineMedia, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	The scheduling systems also provide information electronically and automatically to the newspapers, which allows them to publish correct show starting times with approved advertising graphics.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as being the primary source of data for our financial systems.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	Our revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	As of February 3, 2011, we employed approximately 22,061 persons.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	Some of our facilities employ union projectionists.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Company's expansion into new markets may increase the number of employees represented by unions.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
1168696_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P89_S3	These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
1168696_11_ITEM1_P89_S4	Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves a significant degree of risk.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	For fiscal 2010, our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately $382.3 million and $148.1 million, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As of December 30, 2010, we had total debt obligations of $2,073.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	As of December 30, 2010, we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,381.1 million.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	For a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments" provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	As a result, inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Many of our lease agreements and the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a lease or debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other leases and debt instruments.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Generally, stadium seating found in modern megaplex theatres is preferred by patrons over slope-floored multiplex theatres, which were the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Although, as of December 30, 2010, approximately 81% of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating, we still serve many markets with sloped-floored multiplex theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres, and should other theatre operators choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets, the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, should other theatre operators return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken in the late 1990's, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce ticket prices.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We also compete with other movie delivery vehicles, including cable television, downloads via the Internet, in-home video and DVD, satellite and pay-per-view services.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other delivery vehicles during the theatrical release window.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The theatrical release window has been stable over the past five to six years.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We depend on our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The film distribution business is highly concentrated, with ten major film distributors accounting for approximately 96% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, we are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the ten major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	No assurance of a supply of motion pictures.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may not benefit from our acquisition strategy.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Even if we do identify such candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	acquisition, our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	the difficulty of assimilating the acquired operations and personnel and integrating them into our current business; the potential disruption of our ongoing business; the diversion of management's attention and other resources; the possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; the risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience; the potential impairment of relationships with employees; the possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated; the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected; and the possibility that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres in order to complete acquisition opportunities.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our investment in and revenues from National CineMedia may be negatively impacted by the competitive environment in which National CineMedia operates.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As of December 30, 2010, we owned approximately 19.4% of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, we receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	National CineMedia's in-theatre advertising operations compete with other cinema advertising companies and other advertising mediums including, most notably, television, newspaper, radio and the Internet.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There can be no guarantee that in-theatre advertising will continue to attract major advertisers or that National CineMedia's in-theatre advertising format will be able to generate expected sales of advertising.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Although we have representation on the board of directors of National CineMedia, we do not control this business.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Should National CineMedia fail to maintain the level of profitability it hopes to achieve, its results of operations may be adversely affected and our investment in and earnings and cash flows from National CineMedia may be adversely impacted.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Michael Campbell, our Executive Chairman and Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Anschutz Company owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	As a result, as of December 30, 2010, Anschutz Company controlled approximately 78% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Anschutz Company continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Anschutz Company will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to Anschutz Company but not to other stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In addition, Anschutz Company and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	A prolonged economic downturn could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by prolonged negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending, including those resulting from terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If economic conditions become weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres, including delaying the deployment of new projection and other technologies to our theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For example, our future ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	As of February 22, 2011, we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Anschutz Company is able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by Anschutz Company or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Regal is a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2018 (the "9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes") and 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes due March 15, 2011 (the "6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our Class A common stock, the exposure for which was held by Credit Suisse International ("Credit Suisse") at the time the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes were issued.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In connection with these hedging arrangements, Credit Suisse has taken positions in our Class A common stock in secondary market transactions and/or entered into various derivative transactions after the pricing of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Such hedging arrangements could affect the price of our Class A common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Credit Suisse may modify its hedge positions from time to time prior to the March 15, 2011 maturity of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes by purchasing and selling shares of our Class A common stock, other securities of Regal or other instruments we may wish to use in connection with such hedging.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We cannot assure you that such activity will not affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM1A_P49_S6	For further description of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of December 30, 2010, there are no unresolved comments from the Commission regarding any of our periodic or current reports filed under the Exchange Act.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 30, 2010, we operated 476 theatre locations pursuant to lease agreements and owned the land and buildings in fee for 63 theatre locations.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	For a list of the states in which we operated theatres and the number of theatres and screens operated in each such state as of December 30, 2010, please see the chart under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption "Business Theatre Operations", which is incorporated herein by reference.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 years.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P1_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_11_ITEM2_P1_S5	We believe that these facilities are adequate for our operations.
1168696_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(2) to Form 10-K and Rule 12b-23 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the information required to be furnished by us under this Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) is incorporated by reference to the information contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

1168696_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common equity consists of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.

1168696_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_11_ITEM5_P5_S3	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	We present below selected historical consolidated financial data for Regal based on historical data, for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates, (i) the fiscal year ended December 28, 2006, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the results of operations of seven theatres acquired during the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2004 and the 28 theatres acquired from Signature Theatres on September 30, 2004 (the "fiscal 2004 acquisitions") and the results of operations of seven theatres acquired from R/C Theatres on April 28, 2005 and 21 theatres acquired from Eastern Federal Corporation on July 21, 2005 (the "fiscal 2005 acquisitions") from December 30, 2005 and the results of operations of four theatres acquired from AMC on September 15, 2006 for the period subsequent to the acquisition date, (ii) the fiscal year ended December 27, 2007, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the fiscal 2004 acquisitions, the fiscal 2005 acquisitions and the results of operations of four theatres acquired from AMC on September 15, 2006 from December 29, 2006, (iii) the fiscal year ended January 1, 2009, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the fiscal 2004 acquisitions, the fiscal 2005 acquisitions, the four theatres acquired from AMC from December 28, 2007 and the results of operations of the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres on April 30, 2008 for the period subsequent to the acquisition date, (iv) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the fiscal 2004 acquisitions, the fiscal 2005 acquisitions, the four theatres acquired from AMC and the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres from January 2, 2009 and (v) the fiscal year ended December 30, 2010, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the fiscal 2004 acquisitions, the fiscal 2005 acquisitions, the four theatres acquired from AMC, the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres from January 1, 2010 and the eight theatres acquired from AMC on May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010 for periods subsequent to their acquisition dates.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	The fiscal year ended January 1, 2009 consisted of 53 weeks of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	The selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, January 1, 2009, December 27, 2007 and December 28, 2006 were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Regal and the notes thereto.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	The selected historical financial data do not necessarily indicate the operating results or financial position that would have resulted from our operations on a combined basis during the periods presented, nor is the historical data necessarily indicative of any future operating results or financial position of Regal.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	the below selected financial data, you should also refer to the more complete financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	(1) Fiscal year ended January 1, 2009 was comprised of 53 weeks.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	(2) Includes the December 30, 2010 payment of the $1.40 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM6_P4_S2	(3) Includes the April 13, 2007 payment of the $2.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of Regal Entertainment Group for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 6,698 screens in 539 theatres in 37 states and the District of Columbia as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which concentrates on in-theatre advertising and creating complementary business lines that leverage the operating personnel, asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners, which include us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and discount ticket programs and various other activities in our theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, National CineMedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on-screen advertising, rental of theatres for meetings and concerts and other events.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Film rental costs depend on a variety of factors, including the prospects of a film, the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company's revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The unexpected emergence or continuance of a "hit" film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P12_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	We estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	few weeks after the film is released based on the film's initial box office performance, which is determined by a film's initial box office receipts.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	As a result, there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable, because we make such estimates based on each film's box office receipts through the end of the reporting period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	For the fiscal years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of 30 years.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life, and their depreciable lives (12-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S8	For example, currently the Company is focusing on an accelerated deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S9	With respect to the Company's existing 35mm film projection equipment that is scheduled to be replaced with digital projection systems, the Company has begun to accelerate depreciation on such 35 mm film projection equipment over the expected deployment schedule since the Company plans to dispose of such equipment prior to the end of their useful lives.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P19_S10	To that end, during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2010, the Company recorded approximately $18.9 million of accelerated depreciation related to such 35mm film projection equipment, as described further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The majority of our properties have been appraised.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	For the fiscal years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2010, consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $213.4 million, representing 7.6% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately $14.3 million, or 6.7%.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $16.6 million, or 7.8%.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P25_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, effective December 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	For fiscal 2010, our provision for income taxes was $48.7 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained, the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 38.7% to 39.7% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $1.3 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010 Period"), December 31, 2009 ("Fiscal 2009 Period") and January 1, 2009 ("Fiscal 2008 Period"), the Company entered into various financing transactions which are more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities" below and in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems) from us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	As discussed further under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities" below and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, concurrent with closing, the Company entered into the Digital Cinema Agreements with Kasima, LLC, and made the DCIP Contributions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	After giving effect to the DCIP Contributions, the Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 30, 2010, while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	As discussed further under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities" below and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, during the Fiscal 2010 Period, the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, the Company received an additional 4.5 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	In addition, during the Fiscal 2010 Period, we redeemed approximately 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $14.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	We received approximately $66.0 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in an aggregate gain on sale of $52.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	These transactions, together with National CineMedia's issuance of 6.5 million common units to AMC in the second quarter of 2010 as a result of an acquisition, had the effect of decreasing the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P34_S4	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.4% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	On May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010, the Company acquired eight theatres with 106 screens located in Illinois, Indiana and Colorado from an affiliate of AMC.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Regal purchased five of these AMC theatres representing 63 screens for approximately $55.0 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, and acquired the other three AMC theatres representing 43 screens in exchange for two Regal theatres consisting of 26 screens.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The results of operations of the eight acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	See "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities" below and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives:
1168696_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the Fiscal 2010 Period totaled approximately $327.1 million, including an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.40 per share on each outstanding share of its Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	In addition to the eight theatres representing 106 screens acquired from an affiliate of AMC, we opened two new theatres with 24 screens and closed 19 theatres with 200 screens (including the two theatres exchanged with AMC), ending the Fiscal 2010 Period with 539 theatres and 6,698 screens.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	We continued to embrace new technologies to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts:
1168696_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, the Company focused on an accelerated deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres and expects to continue the accelerated 3D deployment into the first half of 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	We expect all of our screens to be outfitted with digital projection systems by late 2012 or early 2013, with approximately 40% of our total screens being digital 3D capable by mid-2011.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Second, we renegotiated our agreement with IMAX during the Fiscal 2010 Period to expand our IMAX footprint by agreeing to install a total of up to 77 IMAX digital projection systems by the end of 2012.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of December 30, 2010, we operated a total of 50 IMAX screens.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	We believe that expanding our IMAX footprint, combined with a more favorable allocation of costs included in the new agreement, will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Finally, as of December 30, 2010, we had converted seven of our auditoriums to our proprietary large screen format known as RPX SM .
1168696_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	We have been encouraged by the initial results of RPX SM and expect to expand our RPX SM footprint by converting up to 12 additional auditoriums throughout 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	We believe the installation of 3D digital projection systems and IMAX theatres systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to RPX SM auditoriums allow us to offer our patrons premium 3D movie and large all-digital format experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	We remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with 3D film product and other 3D content and are pleased to see continued support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	We are optimistic regarding the breadth of the 2011 film slate, including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium-priced formats.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Part One , Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chip-Wrecked and Sherlock Holmes 2 .
1168696_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	We intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	With respect to capital expenditures, subject to the timing of certain construction projects, we expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales) to be in the range of $85.0 million to $100.0 million for fiscal 2011, consisting of new theatre development, expansion of existing theatre facilities, upgrades and replacements.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Overall for the fiscal 2011 year, we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron and a continued increase in 3D screens and the number of films scheduled for release in premium-priced formats.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	In addition, we expect fiscal 2011 admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	We will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities, selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	As discussed further in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on January 4, 2011, Regal issued and sold $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes at a price equal to 104.5% of their face value.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The notes were issued under an existing Indenture entered into by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), dated August 16, 2010, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated January 7, 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions by the Company, were approximately $154.7 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	The Company used substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering ($152.5 million) to repay a portion of the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	On February 9, 2011, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	This dividend reflects a $0.03 per share increase from the Company's last quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share declared on October 28, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2011 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2011.

1168696_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	The notes were issued on February 15, 2011 under an existing Indenture entered into by and between the Company and the Trustee, dated August 16, 2010, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated January 7, 2011 and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated February 15, 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions by the Company, were approximately $103.1 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P50_S3	The Company used a portion the net proceeds from the offering ($82.1 million) to repay a portion of the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P50_S4	See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this transaction.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	As described further under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities" below and in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on May 19, 2010, Regal Cinemas entered into a sixth amended and restated credit agreement (the "Amended Senior Credit Facility"), with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as Administrative Agent ("Credit Suisse") and the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), which consists of a term loan facility (the "Term Facility") with a final maturity date in November 2016.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	On February 23, 2011 Regal Cinemas entered into a permitted secured refinancing agreement (the "Refinancing Agreement") with REH, Regal, the Guarantors, Credit Suisse, and the Lenders, which amends and refinances the Term Facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Pursuant to the Refinancing Agreement, Regal Cinemas consummated a permitted secured refinancing of the Term Facility in the amount of $1,006.0 million, and in accordance therewith, the Lenders advanced term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,006.0 million with a final maturity date in August 2017 (the "New Term Loans").
1168696_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	Together with other amounts provided by Regal Cinemas, proceeds of the New Term Loans were applied to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility in effect immediately prior to the making of the New Term Loans.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	In addition to extending the maturity date of the New Term Loans, the Refinancing Agreement also amends the Amended Senior Credit Facility by reducing the interest rate on the New Term Loans, by providing, at Regal Cinemas' option, either a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin that is determined according to the consolidated leverage ratio of Regal Cinemas and its subsidiaries.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	Such applicable margin will be either 2.00% or 2.25% in the case of base rate loans and either 3.00% or 3.25% in the case of LIBOR rate loans.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The Refinancing Agreement also amends the Second Amended and Restated Guaranty and Collateral Agreement, dated May 19, 2010, to exclude Margin Stock from the grant of the security interest in the Collateral used to secure the obligations under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Based on our review of industry sources, national box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to Regal's fiscal year of 2010 were estimated to have decreased by less than one percent in comparison to the fiscal year of 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	The industry's box office results were negatively impacted by difficult comparisons generated by the breadth of films released during the fiscal year of 2009, partially offset by ticket price increases and an increase in the percentage of attendance generated by premium-priced 3D and IMAX films, including the strong performance of Avatar , Toy Story 3 , Alice in Wonderland , Iron Man 2 , and Inception .
1168696_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	and the Fiscal 2008 Period (dollars and attendance in millions, except average ticket prices and average concession per patron):

1168696_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	(3) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of total revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, total admissions revenues decreased $35.3 million, or 1.8%, to $1,956.3 million, from $1,991.6 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	An 8.3% decline in attendance, partially offset by a 7.0% increase in average ticket prices, led to the decrease in the Fiscal 2010 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	We believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Fiscal 2010 Period decline in attendance was primarily attributable to the overall lack of appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the Fiscal 2010 Period as compared to the films exhibited during the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S4	An increase in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium-priced 3D and IMAX films exhibited during the Fiscal 2010 Period along with price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews (which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions) were the primary drivers of the increase in our Fiscal 2010 Period average ticket prices.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S5	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the decrease in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was slightly greater than the industry's results for the Fiscal 2010 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P57_S6	We believe the greater than industry decrease in admissions revenues on a per screen basis in the Fiscal 2010 Period was attributable to geographical differences in film product performance.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Total concessions revenues decreased $51.3 million, or 6.6%, to $724.3 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period, from $775.6 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Average concessions revenues per patron during the Fiscal 2010 Period increased 1.9%, to $3.23, from $3.17 for the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily a result of selective price increases.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, other operating revenues increased $0.6 million, or 0.5%, to $127.3 million, from $126.7 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire), revenues from our vendor marketing programs and other theatre revenues, including revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	The slight increase in other operating revenues during the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily driven by increases in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs and other theatre revenues, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our vendor marketing programs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues of 52.5% during the Fiscal 2010 Period were consistent with that of the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues during the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily impacted by higher film costs associated with the success of Avatar , offset by a reduction in newspaper advertising costs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	For the Fiscal 2010 Period, cost of concessions as a percentage of concession revenues was approximately 14.0%, compared to 14.3% for the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	In addition, we also experienced an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Rent expense increased by $3.5 million, or 0.9%, to $382.3 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period, from $378.8 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase in rent expense during the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily attributable to incremental rent associated with the 106 screens acquired from an affiliate of AMC, partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of 200 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, other operating expenses increased $5.5 million, or 0.7%, to $784.0 million, from $778.5 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase in other operating expenses during the Fiscal 2010 Period was attributable to increased costs associated with higher 3D and IMAX film revenues and incremental DCIP related expenses, partially offset by savings in theatre-level payroll and non-rent occupancy costs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	General and administrative expenses increased $2.5 million, or 3.9%, to $66.7 million during the Fiscal 2010 Period, from $64.2 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 2.4% during the Fiscal 2010 Period, from 2.2% in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	The increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily attributable to increases in stock-based compensation expense and corporate payroll costs during the period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, depreciation and amortization expense increased $11.5 million, or 5.7%, to $213.4 million, from $201.9 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2010 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily due to accelerated depreciation of $18.9 million related to the replacement of 35mm film projectors in connection with our conversion to digital projection systems, partially offset by slightly lower capital expenditures during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Income from operations decreased $63.6 million, or 22.8%, to $215.8 million during the Fiscal 2010 Period, from $279.4 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The net decrease in income from operations during the Fiscal 2010 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to the overall decrease in total revenues and the fixed cost nature of certain operating expense line items including rent expense and other operating expenses, partially offset by a lower loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets ($17.9 million and $34.0 million, respectively, for the Fiscal 2010 Period and Fiscal 2009 Period).
1168696_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, net interest expense declined $2.9 million, or 1.9%, to $148.1 million, from $151.0 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	incremental interest income during the Fiscal 2010 Period, partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of the $400.0 million Regal Cinemas 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes") in July 2009 and the issuance of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes in August 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company received $43.0 million and $39.6 million, respectively, in cash distributions from National CineMedia (including payments received under the tax receivable agreement described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) during the Fiscal 2010 Period and Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Approximately $7.4 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of these cash distributions received during the Fiscal 2010 Period and the Fiscal 2009 Period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The remaining amounts were recognized in equity earnings during each of these periods and have been included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	The increase in earnings recognized from National CineMedia during the Fiscal 2010 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to slightly higher earnings of National CineMedia and the timing of their contractual cash distributions to the Company.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	The provision for income taxes of $48.7 million and $61.9 million for the Fiscal 2010 Period and the Fiscal 2009 Period, respectively, reflect effective tax rates of approximately 38.7% and 39.4%, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2010 Period is primarily attributable to a decrease in the effective tax rates in certain states and the lapse of statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	The effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and income tax credits.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2010 Period was $77.6 million, which represents a decrease of $17.9 million, from net income attributable to controlling interest of $95.5 million during the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	The decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating income, the Fiscal 2010 Period loss on debt extinguishment associated with the Amended Senior Credit Facility and certain repurchases of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, incremental losses from the Company's equity investment in DCIP, partially offset by the impact of the $52.0 million ($31.4 million after related tax effects) gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Total admissions revenues increased $108.5 million during the Fiscal 2009 Period, or 5.8%, to $1,991.6 million, from $1,883.1 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period primarily due to a 6.1% increase in average ticket prices, partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in attendance.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	We believe the overall decrease in attendance during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily a result of the timing of the Fiscal 2008 Period calendar, which consisted of fifty-three weeks compared to fifty-two weeks during the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	The overall decrease in Fiscal 2009 Period attendance was mitigated by the full benefit (twelve months in the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to eight months in the Fiscal 2008 Period) of the inclusion of 400 screens acquired from Consolidated Theatres during the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	during the Fiscal 2009 Period were the primary drivers of the increase in our Fiscal 2009 Period average ticket prices.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the increase in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was approximately 200 basis points less than the industry's results for the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	We believe our less than industry increase in admissions revenues on a per screen basis was largely attributable to geographical differences in film product performance and to a lesser extent, the impact of incremental competitor screens.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	During the Fiscal 2009 Period, total concessions revenues increased $17.6 million, or 2.3%, to $775.6 million, from $758.0 million for the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Average concessions revenues per patron during the Fiscal 2009 Period increased 2.6%, to $3.17, from $3.09 for the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	The increase in total concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2009 Period was attributable to an increase in average concessions revenues per patron, partially offset by a slight decrease in attendance during the period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P75_S3	The increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2009 Period were primarily a result of price increases and also benefitted from the concession friendly mix of film product exhibited during such periods.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Other operating revenue decreased $4.1 million, or 3.1%, to $126.7 million for the Fiscal 2009 Period, from $130.8 million for the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	Included in other operating revenue are the theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire), marketing revenues from our vendor marketing programs and other theatre revenues, including revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	The decrease in other operating revenue during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily driven by decreases in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs and other theatre revenues, partially offset by a slight increase in marketing revenues from our vendor marketing programs.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues declined slightly to 52.5% during the Fiscal 2009 Period from 52.6% in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	The decrease in film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of box office revenues during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily the result of a reduction in newspaper advertising costs during such period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	During the Fiscal 2009 Period, cost of concessions increased $4.0 million, or 3.8% as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	Cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2009 Period was approximately 14.3% compared to 14.1% for the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	The increase in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily related to a greater percentage of our concession sales being generated from higher cost items and a decrease in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Rent expense increased by $15.5 million, or 4.3%, to $378.8 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period, from $363.3 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase in rent expense during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily due to the full impact of Consolidated Theatres during the Fiscal 2009 Period and to a lesser extent, incremental rent from 78 new screens added during the Fiscal 2009 Period and modest increases in contingent rent, partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of 111 screens during the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Other operating expenses increased $38.6 million, or 5.2%, to $778.5 million in the Fiscal 2009 Period, from $739.9 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase in other operating expenses during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period was attributable to the full impact of Consolidated Theatres during the Fiscal 2009 Period, increased costs associated with higher IMAX and 3D film revenues, increased gift card transaction fees and general inflationary increases.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	For the Fiscal 2009 Period, general and administrative expenses increased $2.1 million, or 3.4%, to $64.2 million as compared to $62.1 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses remained consistent, at 2.2%, during the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	The slight increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to increases in corporate payroll costs and legal and professional fees during such period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.4 million, or 0.2%, to $201.9 million for the Fiscal 2009 Period, from $202.3 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period was primarily due to lower capital expenditures during the Fiscal 2009 Period and a slightly greater number of fully depreciated fixed assets during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	During the Fiscal 2009 Period, income from operations decreased $5.0 million, or 1.8%, to $279.4 million, from $284.4 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	The overall decrease in income from operations during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period was driven by increases in various operating expense line items, including cost of concessions, rent expense, other operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and net loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets ($34.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, for the Fiscal 2009 Period and Fiscal 2008 Period).
1168696_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net interest expense totaled $151.0 million for the Fiscal 2009 Period, which represents an increase of $22.6 million, or 17.6%, from that of the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The increase in net interest expense during the Fiscal 2009 Period was principally due to a higher effective interest rate on our term facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility (the "Term Facility") as a result of a change in our interest rate swap portfolio during the Fiscal 2009 Period, incremental interest expense related to the Fiscal 2009 Period issuance of the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes, the impact of a full year of interest expense on the $200.0 million 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes and less interest income ($1.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period) during such period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company recorded $39.6 million and $33.1 million, respectively, in cash distributions from National CineMedia during the Fiscal 2009 Period and Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	Approximately $6.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of these cash distributions received during the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P85_S2	In addition, during the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, the Company recorded an additional $5.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of equity earnings with respect to newly issued common units received from National CineMedia during such periods.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P85_S3	As a result, during the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, the Company recognized $38.6 million and $32.9 million, respectively, of earnings from National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P85_S4	Such amounts are presented as "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	The increase in earnings recognized from National CineMedia during the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to incremental earnings of National CineMedia and a corresponding increase in their contractually committed cash distributions to the Company.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	The provision for income taxes of $61.9 million and $74.4 million for the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, respectively, reflect effective tax rates of approximately 39.4% and 39.9%, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to the lapse of statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities during the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	The effective tax rates for the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	During the Fiscal 2009 Period, net income attributable to controlling interest totaled $95.5 million, which represents a decrease of $16.7 million, from net income attributable to controlling interest of $112.2 million in the Fiscal 2008 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income coupled with incremental interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment, partially offset by incremental earnings recognized from National CineMedia described above.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company's consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal 2010 Period include the results of operations of the eight theatres acquired from an affiliate of AMC during May and June 2010 for periods subsequent to the respective date of acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	The acquisition of such theatres is further described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	The comparability of our results between quarters is impacted by the inclusion from such date of the results of operations of the acquisitions and to a lesser extent, seasonality.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly results for the eight quarters ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The quarterly financial data as of each period presented below have been derived from Regal's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for those periods.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Regal and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	(1) Includes the December 30, 2010 payment of the $1.40 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	On a consolidated basis, we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses, capital expenditures, investments, general corporate purposes related to corporate operations, debt service and the Company's quarterly dividend payments.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	The principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the Amended Senior Credit Facility described below.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	Under the terms of the Amended Senior Credit Facility and the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes issued during fiscal 2009, Regal Cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to Regal, its indirect parent.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	Since Regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries, this restriction could impact Regal's ability to effect future debt or dividend payments, pay corporate expenses or redeem or convert for cash its 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P96_S2	In addition, as described further below, the Indenture under the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes limits the Company's (and its restricted subsidiaries') ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, make loans or advances to its subsidiaries (or the Company), or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	Our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs, rent and occupancy, and payroll.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	Film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within 30 days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the Company's concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately 30 to 35 days from purchase.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	Our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within 12 months.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P97_S4	In addition, from time to time, we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and other financing activities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P97_S5	As a result, at any given time, our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $259.4 million, $410.8 million and $270.9 million for the Fiscal 2010 Period, the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The decrease in net cash flows generated from operating activities for the Fiscal 2010 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2009 Period was primarily attributable to a reduction in operating income, coupled with the timing of certain Fiscal 2010 Period vendor and income tax payments.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	the Fiscal 2008 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in working capital, primarily the timing of certain Fiscal 2009 Period vendor payments.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres, new theatre construction, adding new screens to existing theatres, upgrading the Company's theatre facilities (including digital 3D and IMAX screens) and replacing equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	We fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows, cash on hand, proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	We intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects, with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non-maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the Company's internal rate of return targets.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The credit crisis of late 2008 and early 2009 negatively impacted real estate development and has caused a temporary slowdown in our building program.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	As a result, we currently expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales) for theatre development, replacement, expansion, upgrading and replacements to be below our historical levels and in the range of approximately $85.0 million to $100.0 million in fiscal year 2011, exclusive of acquisitions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	Such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	DCIP's financing raised $660.0 million, consisting of $445.0 million in senior bank debt, $135.0 million in additional junior capital and approximately $80.0 million in equity contributions (consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems) from us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	Concurrent with closing, the Company entered into the Digital Cinema Agreements with Kasima, LLC, and made the DCIP Contributions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S3	The Company recorded such DCIP Contributions as an increase in its investment in DCIP, which included the fair value of the 200 existing digital projection systems, as determined by an independent appraisal.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S4	In connection with the contribution of its 200 existing digital projection systems, the Company recorded a loss on the contribution of $2.0 million based on the excess of the carrying value of the digital projection systems contributed over the $12.6 million fair value (as determined by an independent appraisal) of such equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S5	In addition, during May 2010, Regal sold an additional 337 digital projection systems to DCIP for aggregate proceeds of approximately $20.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S6	In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of approximately $2.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S7	Such losses have been presented as a component of "Net (gain) loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets" in the consolidated statement of income for the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S8	After giving effect to the DCIP Contributions, the Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 30, 2010, while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P104_S9	Since the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it will continue to account for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	The costs of implementing digital projection in our theatres will be substantially funded by DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	We expect DCIP to fund the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	We will bear operating and maintenance costs with respect to digital projection systems in our theatres, which we expect to be relatively comparable to what we currently spend on our conventional film projectors.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	In accordance with the Master Lease, the digital projection systems are leased from Kasima, LLC under a twelve-year term with ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P105_S4	The Master Lease also contains a fair value purchase option.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	effective date of the agreement and is, upon certain conditions, subject to minimum annual rent of $3,000 per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	The Company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the Master Lease.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S3	The Company accounts for the Master Lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S4	The initial financing is expected to cover the cost of conversion to digital projection for approximately 70% of our circuit's screens.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S5	We ultimately expect to outfit all of our screens with digital projection systems, with approximately 40% of our total screens being digital 3D capable and intend to complete the conversion of our entire circuit in approximately three to four years.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P106_S6	As of December 30, 2010, we operated 2,202 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 1,710 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	During the early stage of deployment, the Company is focusing on an accelerated deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	We believe the installation of digital 3D projection systems and IMAX theatre systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to RPX(SM) auditoriums will allow us to offer our patrons premium 3D and large format movie experiences, which we believe will generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	We remain optimistic about the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with 3D film product and other 3D content and are pleased to see continued support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	As described more fully in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on April 9, 2008, March 17, 2009 and March 17, 2010 we received from National CineMedia approximately 0.8 million, 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	In addition, on May 29, 2008, we received from National CineMedia approximately 2.9 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement in connection with our acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	On August 18, 2010, we redeemed 4.2 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $13.7 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	We received approximately $64.5 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $50.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S4	In addition, on September 8, 2010, we redeemed an additional 0.1 million National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock and sold them to the underwriters to cover over-allotments at $16.00 per share, further reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $0.3 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S5	We received approximately $1.5 million of net proceeds from this sale, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.2 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S6	These transactions, together with National CineMedia's issuance of 6.5 million common units to AMC in the second quarter of 2010 as a result of an acquisition, had the effect of decreasing the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S7	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.4% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P108_S8	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	On May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010, the Company acquired eight theatres with 106 screens located in Illinois, Indiana and Colorado from an affiliate of AMC.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	Regal purchased five of these AMC theatres representing 63 screens for approximately $55.0 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, and acquired the other three AMC theatres representing 43 screens in exchange for two Regal theatres consisting of 26 screens.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	The results of operations of the eight acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	The total net cash purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $209.3 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P110_S2	See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $82.7 million, $110.5 million and $338.5 million for the Fiscal 2010 Period, the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Contributing to the $27.8 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2010 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2009 Period, was the impact of net proceeds totaling approximately $66.0 million resulting from the sale of NCM, Inc. common stock, coupled with lower capital expenditures and higher proceeds from the disposition of assets during the Fiscal 2010 Period, partially offset by the $55.0 million acquisition of eight AMC theatres and approximately $29.9 million of cash contributions to DCIP during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The $228.0 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period was primarily attributable to the impact of the $209.3 million acquisition of Consolidated Theatres during the Fiscal 2008 Period coupled with capital expenditures that were approximately $22.9 million lower during the Fiscal 2009 Period, partially offset by less proceeds from the disposition of assets of approximately $2.8 million during the Fiscal 2009 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	On May 19, 2010, Regal Cinemas entered into the Amended Senior Credit Facility with Credit Suisse and the Lenders that amends, restates and refinances the fifth amended and restated credit agreement ("the Prior Senior Credit Facility") among Regal Cinemas, Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, and the lenders party thereto.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The Amended Senior Credit Facility consists of a Term Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0 million with a final maturity date in November 2016 and a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $85.0 million with a final maturity date in May 2015.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	The Term Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the Term Facility, with the balance payable on the Term Facility maturity date.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	Net proceeds of the Term Facility (approximately $1,237.5 million) were applied to refinance the term loan under the Prior Senior Credit Facility, which had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1,262.1 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Upon the execution of the Amended Senior Credit Facility, Regal recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $18.4 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P113_S2	No amounts have been drawn on the Revolving Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P113_S3	The Amended Senior Credit Facility also permits Regal Cinemas to borrow additional term loans thereunder, subject to lenders providing additional commitments of up to $200.0 million and satisfaction of other conditions, as well as other term loans for acquisitions and certain capital expenditures subject to lenders providing additional commitments and satisfaction of other conditions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P113_S4	The Amended Senior Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of Regal Cinemas and certain of its subsidiaries.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	The Amended Senior Credit Facility includes several financial covenants including:
1168696_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	maximum ratio of (i) the sum of funded debt (net of unencumbered cash) plus the product of eight (8) times lease expense to (ii) consolidated EBITDAR (as defined in the Amended Senior Credit Facility) of 6.00 to 1.0 throughout the term of the Amended Senior Credit Facility; maximum ratio of funded debt (net of unencumbered cash) to consolidated EBITDA of 4.00 to 1.0 throughout the term of the Amended Senior Credit Facility; minimum ratio of (i) consolidated EBITDAR to (ii) the sum of interest expense plus lease expense of 1.50 to 1.0 throughout the term of the Amended Senior Credit Facility; and maximum capital expenditures not to exceed 35% of consolidated EBITDA for the prior fiscal year plus a one-year carryforward for unused amounts from the prior fiscal year.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	The Amended Senior Credit Facility requires that Regal Cinemas and its subsidiaries comply with certain customary covenants, including with respect to incurring indebtedness and liens, making investments and acquisitions, effecting mergers and asset sales, prepaying indebtedness, and paying dividends.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	Among other things, such limitations will restrict the ability of Regal Cinemas to fund the operations of Regal or any subsidiary of Regal that is not a subsidiary of Regal Cinemas, which guaranties the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Amended Senior Credit Facility includes events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; any material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; cross default and cross acceleration with respect to indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million or more; bankruptcy; judgments involving liability of $25.0 million or more that are not paid; ERISA events; actual or asserted invalidity of guarantees or security documents; and change of control.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	For a detailed summary of other material terms of the Amended Senior Credit Facility, please refer to the information provided under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Please refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of an amendment to our Amended Senior Credit Facility and other financing transactions effected subsequent to the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	On August 10, 2010, Regal entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as the representatives of the underwriters, with respect to the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	On August 16, 2010, the Company issued the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes under the Indenture with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting offering expenses paid by the Company, were approximately $269.5 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P119_S3	The net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, the Regal Cinemas 9 3 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes") and for general corporate purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P119_S4	During the year ended December 30, 2010, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a portion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes as described below.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	The 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.125% per year, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	The 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes mature on August 15, 2018.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	The 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P120_S3	They rank on parity with all of the Company's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and prior to all of the Company's subordinated indebtedness.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P120_S4	The 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of the Company's future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing that indebtedness and to any indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P120_S5	None of the Company's subsidiaries initially guarantee any of the Company's obligations with respect to the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Prior to August 15, 2014, the Company may redeem all or any part of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	The Company may redeem the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after August 15, 2014 at the redemption prices specified in the Indenture.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	In addition, prior to August 15, 2013, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes from the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price specified in the Indenture.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	If the Company undergoes a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	The Indenture contains covenants that limit the Company's (and its restricted subsidiaries') ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations; (iii) enter into certain transactions with affiliates; (iv) permit, directly or indirectly, it to create, incur, or suffer to exist any lien, except in certain circumstances; (v) create or permit encumbrances or restrictions on its ability to pay dividends or make distributions on its capital stock, make loans or advances to its subsidiaries (or the Company), or transfer any properties or assets to its subsidiaries (or the Company); and (vi) merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	These covenants are, however, subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	The Indenture contains other customary terms, including, but not limited to, events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	As of December 30, 2010, we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, during August and September 2010, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a total of approximately $125.3 million principal amount of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, in a series of privately negotiated transactions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	As a result of the repurchases, the Company recorded a $5.2 million loss on debt extinguishment during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	In addition, on November 1, 2010, we redeemed the remaining outstanding $51.5 million principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of 100.0% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	As of December 30, 2010, we had approximately $1,232.5 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the Term Facility, $275.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, $391.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes and $74.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	As of December 30, 2010, we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the Revolving Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	During the Fiscal 2010 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $111.1 million in the aggregate.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	In addition, on December 30, 2010, Regal paid declared an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.40 per share on each outstanding share of its Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $216.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	On February 9, 2011, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 15, 2011, to stockholders of record on March 3, 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	This dividend reflects a $0.03 per share increase from our last quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share declared on October 28, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S4	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S5	We, at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P127_S6	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $299.5 million, $142.4 million and $197.4 million for the Fiscal 2010 Period, the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Period, $128.6 million used to repurchase a portion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2010 Period, $51.5 million used to redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes, incremental payments (including a $12.5 million debt discount) related to the Amended Senior Credit Facility and incremental debt acquisition costs and related to the Amended Senior Credit Facility and the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, partially offset by proceeds of $275.0 million received in connection with the Fiscal 2010 Period issuance of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	The net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period of $55.0 million was primarily attributable to a $73.4 million reduction of dividends paid to shareholders during the Fiscal 2009 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2008 Period, partially offset by the impact of the net cash proceeds associated with the convertible note hedge arrangement with Credit Suisse and a warrant to Credit Suisse to purchase shares of our Class A common stock transactions during the Fiscal 2008 Period and incremental debt acquisition costs incurred during the Fiscal 2009 Period related to issuance of 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes and the Prior Senior Credit Facility, as described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of certain rating agencies, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P130_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the Company's current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P130_S4	A downgrade of the Company's debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Below are our latest ratings per category, which were current as of the date of this Form 10-K.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") were approximately $487.8 million, $510.3 million and $517.3 million for the Fiscal 2010 Period, the Fiscal 2009 Period and the Fiscal 2008 Period, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	The Company uses EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, for servicing our debt, paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs, prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors for these purposes as well.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, since it omits the impact of interest, taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash (such as receivables, payables and inventories) as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items (such as long term loss accruals and deferred items).
1168696_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	Because EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized, which assets will often have to be replaced in the future.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	time as described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	Nonetheless, EBITDA is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that these measures are critical to the capital markets' analysis of our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P134_S2	We also evaluate EBITDA because it is clear that movements in these non-GAAP measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	A reconciliation of EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas had three interest rate swap agreements effective as of January 1, 2009, which hedged an aggregate of approximately $700.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	During the quarter ended April 2, 2009, Regal Cinemas entered into four additional hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two to three years each from the respective effective dates of the swaps, which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 2.15% to 2.53% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	These interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately $1,000.0 million of variable rate debt obligations and became effective during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the three interest rate swaps effective as of January 1, 2009 matured.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	As a result, the Company's four interest rate swap agreements effective as of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 hedged an aggregate of approximately $1,000.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 5.82%.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	On September 15, 2008, because of the sudden deterioration in the credit standing of the Lehman counterparty to an interest rate swap agreement designated to hedge approximately $100.0 million of variable rate debt obligations, the Company concluded that the hedging relationship was no longer expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	As a result, on September 15, 2008, the hedging relationship ceased to qualify for hedge accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	For the period from September 15, 2008 through September 25, 2008, the Company recognized $0.5 million (the change in fair value of the former hedging derivative) as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	On October 3, 2008, the Lehman counterparty filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	As a result, an event of default occurred under the provisions of the interest rate swap agreement between the Company and the Lehman counterparty, which effectively terminated the interest rate swap on October 3, 2008, as indicated above.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	variable rate debt obligations) as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining life of the two-year original hedge as long as the variable rate debt obligations remain outstanding.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	During the quarter ended October 1, 2009, the Company released the final portion of the deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss by recording interest expense (net of related tax effects) of approximately $0.4 million and a corresponding $0.4 million reduction of other comprehensive loss.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company paid a final termination value of approximately $2.5 million (including accrued interest) associated with the interest rate swap.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	Under the terms of the Company's effective interest rate swap agreements as of December 30, 2010, Regal Cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from 2.15% to 2.53% and receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	The 3-month LIBOR rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate-swaps for the following three-month period.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter, until expiration.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the Company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the 3-month LIBOR on approximately $1,000.0 million of variable rate obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	The change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_11_ITEM7_P146_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the designated hedging instruments (the four interest rate swaps) will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P147_S3	See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.

1168696_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	Future interest payments on the Company's hedged indebtedness as of December 30, 2010 (the remaining $1,000.0 million of borrowings under the Term Facility) are based on (1) the applicable margin (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) as of December 30, 2010 3.50% and (2) the expected fixed interest payments under the Company's interest rate swap agreements, which are described in further detail under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2010.

1168696_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P154_S3	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P154_S4	Our operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2010 and represent liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P154_S5	The table does not include approximately $25.7 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits for which we do not believe that the amount and timing of the payments are reasonably estimable.
1168696_11_ITEM7_P154_S6	In addition, as of December 30, 2010, Regal Cinemas had approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the $85.0 million Revolving Facility.

1168696_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company's interest rate risk is confined to interest rate exposure of its and its wholly owned subsidiaries' debt obligations that bear interest based on floating rates.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P6_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P6_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P19_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P19_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities described below, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	This analysis resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $10.3 million, $15.3 million and $22.4 million for the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 15 to 20 years.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P31_S2	Certain leases for Company theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P31_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because our leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon our determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P35_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of our leases, in our view, to consider that our lease renewal options are reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, we generally consider the initial base term as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was approximately $178.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the Company is required to reallocate the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 indicated that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	As of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, intangible assets totaled $32.5 million and $18.1 million, respectively, before accumulated amortization of $10.3 million and $6.4 million, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Intangible assets are recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	In connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres described in Note 3 "Acquisitions," the Company acquired certain identifiable intangible assets, including $9.9 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 13.1 years and approximately $8.2 million related to an on-screen advertising contract which will be amortized on a straight-line basis through January 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	During the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, the Company recognized $3.9 million, $3.8 million and $2.6 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	during the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 30, 2010 is projected below:
1168696_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Other non-current assets include debt acquisition costs, which are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	Debt acquisition costs as of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were $51.8 million and $64.6 million, respectively, before accumulated amortization of $19.4 million and $31.7 million, respectively.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P52_S2	In order to determine whether the carrying value of investments may have experienced an "other-than-temporary" decline in value necessitating the write-down of the recorded investment, the Company considers various factors, including the period of time during which the fair value of the investment remains substantially below the recorded amounts, the investees financial condition and quality of assets, the length of time the investee has been operating, the severity and nature of losses sustained in current and prior years, a reduction or cessation in the investees dividend payments, suspension of trading in the security, qualifications in accountant's reports due to liquidity or going concern issues, investee announcement of adverse changes, downgrading of investee debt, regulatory actions, changes in reserves for product liability, loss of a principal customer, negative operating cash flows or working capital deficiencies and the recording of an impairment charge by the investee for goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P53_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P53_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P53_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P53_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P53_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P57_S3	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P57_S4	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P57_S5	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	As described in this Note 2 under "Investments," deferred revenue related to the sale of our equity interest in Fandango will be amortized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the six-year term of the agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement will be amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P58_S3	As of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, approximately $339.2 million and $339.4 million of deferred revenue related to the ESA was recorded as a component of non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P60_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at one of our theatres and earn concession or ticket awards based on the number of credits accumulated.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	Because we believe that the value of the awards granted to our Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under our Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, the costs of these awards have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	Start-up costs associated with a new theatre are also expensed as incurred.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock And Share-Based Compensation," effective December 30, 2005, we adopted ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall utilizing the modified prospective approach.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	Prior to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10, we accounted for stock option grants in accordance using the intrinsic value method, and accordingly, recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants when the exercise price equaled the fair value of common stock on the date of grant.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	In connection with the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company also elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P67_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	As of December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, the Company managed its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Total comprehensive income for the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009 was $75.7 million, $95.1 million and $103.9 million, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income attributable to controlling interest and other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangements and available-for-sale equity securities during each of the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2008 and 2009 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2010 presentation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	SFAS No. 141(R) requires all business combinations completed after the effective date to be accounted for by applying the acquisition method (previously referred to as the purchase method).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	SFAS No. 141(R) expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations; requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in revenue, not goodwill; changes the recognition timing for restructuring costs; and requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	Future reductions in the valuation allowance recorded relative to pre-acquisition periods will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	In addition, with respect to uncertain tax positions, changes in the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to pre-acquisition periods will result in an increase/decrease in the provision for income taxes (see Note 7 "Income Taxes" for further discussion).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	SFAS No. 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P76_S2	Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent's equity.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P76_S3	The amount of net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income (loss) on the face of the income statement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	SFAS No. 160 clarifies that changes in a parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	SFAS No. 160 was adopted by the Company on January 2, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P78_S2	The adoption had the effect of reclassifying amounts previously classified under "minority interest" (approximately $(0.4) million as of January 1, 2009 and $0.5 million as of December 27, 2007) to a component of equity under "noncontrolling interest" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of deficit and comprehensive income (loss).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P78_S3	Amounts previously classified under "minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries" are now classified as "noncontrolling interest" and presented net of tax below "net income" to arrive at "net income attributable to controlling interest" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which amends SFAS No. 133, and requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information about how and why a company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Statement expands the current disclosure framework in SFAS No. 133.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company adopted SFAS No. 161 during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	The adoption of SFAS No. 161 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165, Subsequent Events, which establishes reporting and disclosure requirements based on the existence of conditions at the date of the balance sheet for events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	Companies are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	During June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) which is to be adopted as of the beginning of its first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, and interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	No. 167 amends FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46(R)") to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise's variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P82_S2	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics:
1168696_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and b.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to add an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P85_S2	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise's involvement in a variable interest entity.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P85_S3	The enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The adoption of SFAS No. 167 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	No. 168 reorganizes the thousands of GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	Also included is relevant Commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	SFAS No. 168 was effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods that end after September 15, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance as of October 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P89_S2	The adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements , ("ASU 2010-06").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	This Update provides a greater level of disaggregated information and enhanced disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 and became effective for the Company as of April 1, 2010 except for certain disclosure requirements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	Disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years and is effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	On May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010, the Company acquired eight theatres with 106 screens located in Illinois, Indiana and Colorado from an affiliate of AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Company purchased five of these AMC theatres representing 63 screens for approximately $55.0 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, and acquired the other three AMC theatres representing 43 screens in exchange for two Regal theatres consisting of 26 screens.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S2	As of the acquisition date, the exchanged Regal theatres had a net book value of approximately $0.2 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S3	The Company accounted for the exchanged theatre assets as a non-monetary transaction and as such, allocated the net book value of the Regal theatres to the exchanged AMC theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S4	Total cash paid of approximately $55.0 million was directly allocated to the other five AMC theatres using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S5	Accordingly, the total cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S6	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including an independent third party valuation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P92_S7	The results of operations of the eight acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following is a summary of the preliminary allocation of the aggregate cash purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the respective dates of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	The transaction included the acquisition of certain identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $14.4 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 35 years.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P94_S1	Unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 reflecting the above acquisition have not been presented herein because the impact was inconsequential to the historical consolidated statements of income presented herein.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	On April 30, 2008, the Company acquired Consolidated Theatres, which held a total of 28 theatres with 400 screens in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	The total net cash purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $209.3 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	In conjunction with the closing, we entered into a final judgment with the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), which required us to hold separate and divest ourselves of four theatres comprising 52 screens in North Carolina.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	Three of the four theatres subject to the judgment were existing Regal properties and the fourth theatre was acquired from Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	Because the fourth theatre had minimal and declining cash flows at the acquisition date, none of the purchase price was allocated to the long-lived assets associated with this theatre.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S3	Our impairment review during the quarter ended June 26, 2008 did not result in any impairment charges related to these four theatres on a standalone basis.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S4	However, during the quarter ended September 25, 2008, the Company made the decision to sell three of these four theatres (two of the Regal theatres and the Consolidated theatre) together in order to partially satisfy our divestiture requirement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S5	As a result of agreeing to sell the theatres as a package, we were required to evaluate the theatres for impairment as a disposal group (as opposed to the stand alone evaluation during the quarter ended June 26, 2008) and accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.9 million during the quarter ended September 25, 2008.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S6	On October 23, 2008, the Company completed its divestiture of the three theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P96_S7	On April 30, 2009, the Company completed its divestiture of the last of the four theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including an independent third party valuation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P97_S2	The results of operations of the acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	The following is a summary of the final allocation of the cash purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	The transaction included the acquisition of certain identifiable intangible assets, including $9.9 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 13.1 years and approximately $8.2 million related to an on-screen advertising contract which will be amortized on a straight-line basis through January 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	On February 12, 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark") formed a joint venture company known DCIP, to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema in our theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S2	DCIP's financing raised approximately $660.0 million, consisting of approximately $445.0 million in senior bank debt, approximately $135.0 million in additional junior capital and approximately $80.0 million in equity contributions (consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems) from us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S3	Concurrent with closing, the Company entered into a master equipment lease agreement (the "Master Lease") and other related agreements (collectively, the "Digital Cinema Agreements") with Kasima, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S4	Upon execution of the Digital Cinema Agreements, the Company made equity contributions to DCIP of approximately $41.7 million, consisting of $29.1 million in cash and 200 existing digital projection systems with a fair value of approximately $12.6 million (collectively, the "DCIP Contributions").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S5	The Company recorded such DCIP Contributions as an increase in its investment in DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S6	In connection with the contribution of its 200 existing digital projection systems, the Company recorded a loss on the contribution of $2.0 million based on the excess of the carrying value of the digital projection systems contributed over the $12.6 million fair value (as determined by an independent appraisal) of such equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S7	In addition, during May 2010, Regal sold an additional 337 digital projection systems to DCIP for aggregate proceeds of approximately $20.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S8	In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of approximately $2.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P100_S9	Such losses have been presented as a component of "Net (gain) loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets" in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	After giving effect to the DCIP Contributions, the Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 30, 2010, while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P101_S1	Since the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it will continue to account for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P101_S2	The Company's investment in DCIP is included as a component of "Other non-current assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	equity losses in DCIP of $7.3 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	The changes in the carrying amount of our investment in DCIP for the year ended December 30, 2010 are as follows (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	(1) In addition to cash investments in DCIP totaling $0.7 million, upon execution of the Digital Cinema Agreements, the Company effected additional equity contributions to DCIP of approximately $41.7 million, consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems, during the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	(2) For the year ended December 30, 2010, the Company recorded a loss of $11.0 million, representing its share of the net loss of DCIP.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	Such amount is presented as a component of "Other, net" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	We expect DCIP to fund the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	In accordance with the Master Lease, the digital projection systems are leased from Kasima, LLC under a twelve-year term with ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	The Master Lease also contains a fair value purchase option.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	Under the Master Lease, the Company pays annual minimum rent of $1,000 per digital projection system for the first six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement and is, upon certain conditions, subject to minimum annual rent of $3,000 per digital projection system beginning at six and half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the Master Lease.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P105_S2	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P105_S3	The Company accounts for the Master Lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	During 2010, the Company focused on an accelerated deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to a majority of its first run U.S. theatres and expects to continue the accelerated 3D deployment into the first half of 2011.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	With respect to the Company's existing 35mm film projection equipment that is scheduled to be replaced with digital projection systems, the Company has begun to accelerate depreciation on such 35 mm film projection equipment over the expected deployment schedule since the Company plans to dispose of such equipment prior to the end of their useful lives.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P106_S2	To that end, during the year ended December 30, 2010, the Company recorded approximately $18.9 million of accelerated depreciation related to such 35mm film projection equipment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	As of December 30, 2010, we operated 2,202 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 1,710 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	In March 2005, Regal and AMC announced the combination of the operations of Regal CineMedia Corporation ("RCM"), and AMC's subsidiary, National Cinema Network, Inc., into a new joint venture company known as National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	In July 2005, Cinemark, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired an interest in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising and creating complementary business lines that leverage the operating personnel, asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	National CineMedia is, subject to limited exceptions, the exclusive provider of advertising and event services to Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P109_S2	The Company did not recognize any gain or loss resulting from the initial formation of National CineMedia due to the Company's continued involvement in the operations of National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P109_S3	Pursuant to the other documents entered into in connection with the joint venture transaction, AMC and Regal, through their subsidiaries, retained all advertising contracts signed on or before the close of business on March 31, 2005, and Cinemark retained all advertising contracts signed on or before the close of business on July 15, 2005, subject to an administrative fee payable to National CineMedia to service such contracts.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P110_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	As a result of the NCM, Inc.'s acquisition of common units in National CineMedia, the Company recognized a change in interest gain of approximately $182.7 million along with a corresponding increase in the Company's equity investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their ESAs with National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P112_S1	In exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds, RCI agreed to a modification of National CineMedia's payment obligation under the ESA.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P112_S2	The modification extended the term of the ESA to 30 years, provided National CineMedia with a five-year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.07 payment per patron which will increase by 8% every five years starting at the end of fiscal 2011 and a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which will increase by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $926 for fiscal 2010).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P113_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P113_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P113_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P113_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P113_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million, which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P114_S2	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	Under the units of revenue method, amortization for a period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the ESA modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P116_S2	Regal sold approximately 1.6 million common units to NCM, Inc. for proceeds of approximately $32.2 million and recognized a gain on the sale of such units of approximately $19.3 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P116_S3	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P116_S4	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one-to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	Upon the closing of the IPO, National CineMedia entered into a $725.0 million term loan facility, the net cash proceeds of which were used to redeem preferred units issued to each of Regal, AMC and Cinemark on a pro rata basis pursuant to a recapitalization of National CineMedia prior to completion of the IPO.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P117_S1	We received approximately $315.1 million as a result of the preferred unit redemption.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P117_S2	The Company recognized such cash distributions from National CineMedia by (1) reducing its equity investment in National CineMedia from approximately $166.4 million to zero and (2) recording distributions in excess of the investment balance in National CineMedia of approximately $148.7 million as a gain.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P117_S3	After the payment of current taxes, net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled approximately $447.4 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	Because the investment in National CineMedia has been reduced to zero, we will not provide for any additional losses as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P118_S2	Until such time, equity earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P118_S3	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	created to account for changes in the number of theatre screens operated by each of the joint venture partners.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	Historically, each of the joint venture partners has increased the number of screens it operates through acquisitions and newly built theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P121_S2	Since the increased attendance associated with these incremental screens in turn provides for additional advertising revenues to National CineMedia, National CineMedia agreed to compensate the joint venture partners by issuing additional common membership units to the joint venture partners in consideration for their increased attendance from newly built theatres and acquisitions and overall contribution to the joint venture.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P121_S3	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement also provides protection to National CineMedia in that the joint venture partners may be required to transfer or surrender common units to National CineMedia based on certain limited events, including declines in attendance associated with certain closed theatres and the number of screens operated.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P121_S4	As a result, each joint venture partner's equity ownership interests are proportionately adjusted to reflect the risks and rewards relative to their contributions to the joint venture.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement provides that transfers of common units are solely between the joint venture partners and National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P122_S1	There are no transfers of units among the joint venture partners.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P122_S2	In addition, there are no circumstances under which common units would be surrendered by the Company to National CineMedia in the event of an acquisition by one of the joint venture partners.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P122_S3	However, adjustments to the common units owned by one of the joint venture partners will result in an adjustment to the Company's equity ownership interest percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P123_S1	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P123_S2	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 30, 2010, the Company received an additional 4.5 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14 which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	The NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in its proportionate share of tax basis in NCM Inc.'s tangible and intangible assets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	On the IPO date, NCM, Inc., the Company, AMC and Cinemark entered into a tax receivable agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, NCM, Inc. will make cash payments to us, AMC and Cinemark in amounts equal to 90% of NCM, Inc.'s actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the intangible assets described above.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S3	For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax will be computed by comparing NCM, Inc.'s actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NCM, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase in NCM Inc.'s proportionate share of tax basis in NCM's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S4	The tax receivable agreement shall generally apply to NCM, Inc.'s taxable years up to and including the 30 th anniversary date of the NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S5	Pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, the Company received payments of $7.0 million from NCM, Inc. during the year ended December 30, 2010 with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2008 and 2009 taxable years.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company received payments of $5.7 million with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2008 taxable year.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S7	Finally, during the year ended January 1, 2009, the Company received payments of $4.6 million with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2007 taxable year.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P127_S8	Such payments are accounted for using the equity method as described further below.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	Our investment in National CineMedia is included as a component of "Other non-current assets" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	National CineMedia for the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009 are as follows (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	(1) On April 9, 2008, March 17, 2009 and March 17, 2010 we received from National CineMedia approximately 0.8 million, 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P130_S1	In addition, on May 29, 2008, we received from National CineMedia approximately 2.9 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement in connection with our acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P130_S2	The Company recorded the additional common units (Additional Investments Tranche) at fair value using the available closing stock prices of NCM, Inc. as of the dates on which the units were received.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P130_S3	As a result of these adjustments, the Company recorded increases of $5.9 million, $7.0 million and $73.3 million to its investment in National CineMedia during the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	Since Consolidated Theatres maintains an existing agreement with an on-screen advertising provider, National CineMedia will not be provided access to such theatre locations until expiration of the related advertising contract.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P131_S1	In accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, Regal agreed to pay National CineMedia an amount that approximates the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that would have been generated by National CineMedia if it were able to sell on-screen advertising in the acquired theatre locations on an exclusive basis.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	during the year ended January 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S1	Such amount was determined by the present value of the ultimate amount estimated to be paid to National CineMedia (approximately $8.9 million) through expiration of the on-screen advertising contract.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S2	The accretion associated with this obligation will be reflected in interest expense over the life of the related obligation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S3	The Company recorded the remaining $65.4 million as an increase to deferred revenue during the year ended January 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S4	This amount is being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S5	With respect to the common units received on March 17, 2010 and March 17, 2009, the Company recorded a corresponding $12.9 million increase to deferred revenue.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P132_S6	This amount is being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	(2) The Company's share in the net income of National CineMedia with respect to the Additional Investments Tranche totaled $5.2 million, $5.2 million and $2.6 million during the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S1	Such amounts have been included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S2	(3) During the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, January 1, 2009, the Company received $43.0 million, $39.6 million, $33.1 million, respectively, in cash distributions from National CineMedia (including payments received under the tax receivable agreement).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S3	Approximately $7.4 million, $6.2 million and $2.8 million of these cash distributions received during the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, respectively, were attributable to the Additional Investments Tranche and were recognized as a reduction in our investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S4	The remaining amounts were recognized in equity earnings during each of these periods and have been included as component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S5	(4) On August 18, 2010, we redeemed 4.2 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $13.7 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S6	We received approximately $64.5 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $50.8 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S7	Finally, on September 8, 2010, we redeemed an additional 0.1 million National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock and sold them to the underwriters to cover over-allotments at $16.00 per share, further reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $0.3 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S8	We received approximately $1.5 million of net proceeds from this sale, resulting in a gain on sale of $1.2 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S9	These transactions caused a proportionate decrease in the Company's Initial Investment Tranche and Additional Investments Tranche and decreased our ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P133_S10	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.4% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	As a result of the amendment to the ESA and related modification payment, the Company recognizes various types of other revenue from National CineMedia, including per patron and per digital screen theatre access fees, net of payments for on-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire, other NCM revenue and amortization of upfront ESA modification fees utilizing the units of revenue amortization method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	These revenues are presented as a component of other operating revenues in the Company's financial statements and consist of the following amounts (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	As of December 30, 2010, approximately $2.1 million and $1.6 million due from/to National CineMedia were included in "Trade and other receivables, net" and "Accounts payable," respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Company also maintains an investment in RealD, Inc., an entity specializing in the licensing of 3D technologies.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	The carrying value of the Company's investment in RealD, Inc. as of December 30, 2010 was approximately $31.9 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P137_S2	See Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for a discussion of fair value estimation methods and assumptions with respect to the Company's investment in RealD, Inc.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P137_S3	The Company has recorded this investment within "Other Non-Current Assets" in the accompanying December 30, 2010 consolidated balance sheet.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	Debt obligations at December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consist of the following (in millions):
1168696_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	On May 19, 2010, Regal Cinemas entered into a sixth amended and restated credit agreement (the "Amended Senior Credit Facility"), with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as Administrative Agent ("Credit Suisse") and the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") which amends, restates and refinances the fifth amended and restated credit agreement (the "Prior Senior Credit Facility") among Regal Cinemas, Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch, and the lenders party thereto.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	The Amended Senior Credit Facility consists of a term loan facility (the "Term Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0 million with a final maturity date in November 2016 and a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") in an aggregate principal amount of $85.0 million with a final maturity date in May 2015.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P139_S2	The Term Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the Term Facility, with the balance payable on the Term Facility maturity date.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	Proceeds of the Term Facility (approximately $1,237.5 million, net of a $12.5 million debt discount) were applied to refinance the term loan under the Prior Senior Credit Facility, which had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1,262.1 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	Upon the execution of the Amended Senior Credit Facility, Regal recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $18.4 million.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	Company used all of the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the Prior Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	The 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes are Regal Cinemas' general senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; and senior in right of payment to all of Regal Cinemas' existing and future subordinated indebtedness, including the existing Regal Cinemas 9 3 / 8 % Senior Subordinated Notes (the "Senior Subordinated Notes").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P161_S1	The 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to all of Regal Cinemas' existing and future secured indebtedness, including all borrowings under the Amended Senior Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of Regal Cinemas' subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	Interest on the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2008.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	Upon conversion, we may elect to deliver cash in lieu of shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P165_S1	The conversion price and the number of shares delivered on conversion are subject to adjustment upon certain events.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	In connection with the issuance of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, we used approximately $6.6 million of the net proceeds of the offering to enter into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our Class A common stock to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	Under the terms of the convertible note hedge arrangement (the "2008 Convertible Note Hedge") with Credit Suisse, we paid $12.6 million for a forward purchase option contract under which we are entitled to purchase from Credit Suisse a fixed number of shares of our Class A common stock (at December 30, 2010, at a price per share of $21.0348).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	In the event of the conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, this forward purchase option contract allows us to purchase, at a fixed price equal to the implicit conversion price of shares issued under the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the shares that we issue to a note holder upon conversion.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P167_S2	Settlement terms of this forward purchase option allow the Company to elect cash or share settlement based on the settlement option it chooses in settling the conversion feature of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	In 2008, we also sold to Credit Suisse a warrant (the "2008 Warrant") to purchase shares of our Class A common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P168_S1	The 2008 Warrant is currently exercisable for approximately 3.6 million shares of our Class A common stock at the December 30, 2010 exercise price of $23.1739 per share (which exercise price has been and may be further adjusted pursuant to the provisions of the 2008 Warrant).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P168_S2	We received $6.0 million in cash from Credit Suisse in return for the sale of this forward share purchase option contract.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	Credit Suisse cannot exercise the 2008 Warrant unless and until a conversion event occurs.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P169_S1	We have the option of settling the 2008 Warrant in cash or shares of our Class A common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P169_S2	We accounted for the sale of the 2008 Warrant as the sale of a permanent equity instrument pursuant to the guidance in ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity's Own Equity .
1168696_11_ITEM8_P169_S3	Accordingly, the $6.0 million sales price of the forward stock purchase option contract was recorded as a decrease to consolidated deficit.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	The 2008 Convertible Note Hedge and the 2008 Warrant allow us to acquire sufficient Class A common shares from Credit Suisse to meet our obligation to deliver Class A common shares upon conversion by the note holder, unless the Class A common share price exceeds $23.1739 (as of December 30, 2010).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	When the fair value of our Class A common shares exceeds such price, the equity contracts no longer have an offsetting economic impact, and accordingly will no longer be effective as a share-for-share hedge of the dilutive impact of possible conversion.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	The 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes allow us to settle any conversion by remitting to the note holder the accreted value of the note in cash plus the conversion spread (the excess conversion value over the accreted value) in either cash, shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of stock and cash.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P171_S1	The accounting for convertible debt with such settlement features is addressed in the consensus reached with respect to the accounting for Instrument B as set forth in ASC Subtopic 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging Embedded Derivatives .
1168696_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	shares and will result in dilution in our earnings per share computations using the if-converted method, if the effect is dilutive.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes described above, during the year ended December 30, 2010, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase a total of approximately $125.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, in a series of privately negotiated transactions.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	As a result of the repurchases, the Company recorded a $5.2 million loss on debt extinguishment during the year December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options , requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) should separately account for the liability and equity (conversion feature) components of such instruments.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P174_S1	As a result, interest expense is imputed and recognized based upon the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate, which will result in incremental non-cash interest expense.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P174_S2	During the years ended December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company recorded approximately $3.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense on the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P174_S3	The amount of contractual coupon interest recognized on the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes during the same periods was approximately $10.1 million and $12.5 million, respectively.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	After giving effect to the repurchases during the quarter ended December 30, 2010 described under "Regal 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes" above, as of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the carrying amounts of the $200.0 million 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes were approximately $74.4 million and $194.6 million, respectively, and the carrying amount of the related equity component (conversion feature) was $12.6 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P175_S1	We anticipate recording additional non-cash interest expense on the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes in the amount of $0.3 million (the unamortized discount as of December 30, 2010) through the March 2011 maturity date of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, thereby increasing the carrying value to $200.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P175_S2	As of December 30, 2010, the if-converted value of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes was approximately $74.7 million.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P176_S1	On September 8, 2005, Regal Cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with a maturity term of four years.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P176_S2	These interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately $1,100.0 million of its variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	On June 30, 2007, one of our interest rate swaps designated to hedge approximately $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations matured.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	On August 9, 2007, Regal Cinemas entered into two additional hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two years each.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P177_S2	These interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	2008, two of our interest rate swaps designated to hedge $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations matured.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	As described further below, on October 3, 2008, an interest rate swap agreement designed to hedge approximately $100.0 million of variable rate debt obligations effectively terminated.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P178_S2	As a result, Regal Cinemas had three interest rate swap agreements effective as of January 1, 2009, which hedged an aggregate of approximately $700.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, Regal Cinemas entered into four additional hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two to three years each from the respective effective dates of the swaps, which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 2.15% to 2.53% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P179_S1	These interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately $1,000.0 million of variable rate debt obligations and became effective during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P179_S2	Also during the year ended December 31, 2009, the three interest rate swaps effective as of January 1, 2009 matured.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P179_S3	As a result, the Company's four interest rate swap agreements effective as of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 hedge an aggregate of approximately $1,000.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 5.82%.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	Under the terms of the Company's effective interest rate swap agreements as of December 30, 2010, Regal Cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from 2.15% to 2.53% and receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P180_S1	The 3-month LIBOR rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate-swaps for the following three-month period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter, until expiration.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P181_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the Company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the 3-month LIBOR on approximately $1,000.0 million of variable rate obligations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	The change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the designated hedging instruments (the four interest rate swaps) will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	In December 1995, United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ("UATC") entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby 31 owned properties were sold to and leased back from an unaffiliated third party.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P196_S1	In conjunction with the transaction, the buyer of the properties issued publicly traded pass-through certificates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P196_S2	In connection with this sale and leaseback transaction, UATC entered into a Participation Agreement that requires UATC to comply with various covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, guarantees, issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries and subsidiary distributions, transfer of assets and payment of dividends.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	The Company's net operating loss carryforwards were generated by the entities of United Artists, Edwards and Hoyts.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an "ownership change" of a corporation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P202_S1	Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize the net operating losses acquired from United Artists, Edwards and Hoyts may be impaired as a result of the "ownership change" limitations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	In assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P203_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	ended December 30, 2010, the valuation allowance was increased by $2.3 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created during the year ended December 30, 2010 would not be realized.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	Additionally, during the year ended December 30, 2010, the valuation allowance was increased by $0.2 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created in years ended before December 30, 2010 would not be realized.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $11.1 million and $11.5 million within the next twelve months due the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, were $17.6 million and $17.9 million, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P207_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.7 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P209_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P210_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P210_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	In prior years, private litigants and the DOJ had filed claims against us or our subsidiaries alleging that a number of our theatres with stadium seating violated the ADA because these theatres allegedly failed to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with lines of sight comparable to those available to other members of the general public and denied persons in wheelchairs access to the stadium portion of the theatres.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	On June 8, 2005, Regal reached an agreement with the DOJ resolving and dismissing the private litigants' claims and all claims made by the United States under the ADA.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	From time to time, we receive claims that the stadium seating offered by our theatres allegedly violates the ADA.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	In these instances, we seek to resolve or dismiss these claims based on the terms of the DOJ settlement or under applicable ADA standards.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth above, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	In addition, we, from time to time, receive letters from the state officials in states where we operate theatres regarding investigation into the accessibility of our theatres to persons with visual impairments or the deaf and hard of hearing.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P214_S1	In addition, on July 20, 2010, the DOJ issued Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the provision of closed captioning and descriptive audio within the theatre environment.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P214_S2	Significantly, this is the first time the DOJ has stated that while open captioning may not be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, closed captioning is so required.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P214_S3	We believe we provide the members of the visually and hearing impaired communities with reasonable access to the movie-going experience but are further evaluating our options in the digital format and potential compliance issues related to same.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	On December 9, 2010, we learned that the District Attorney for Kings County, New York, filed a criminal complaint against the Company and the manager of the Company's theater located at 3907 Shore Parkway, Brooklyn, New York (the "Sheepshead Bay Theater").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	The complaint alleges, among other things, that there were multiple instances where sewage from the Sheepshead Bay Theater was released into the waters of the State of New York without a valid permit.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	The actual costs that will be incurred in connection with this action cannot be quantified at this time and will depend on many unknown factors.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	although an amount cannot be predicted.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P218_S1	These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P220_S1	We believe we have adequately provided for the litigation or settlement of such matters.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P220_S2	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	Under each of the employment contracts, the Company must indemnify each executive from and against all liabilities with respect to such executive's service as an officer, and as a director, to the extent applicable.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P240_S0	In 2002, the Company established the Regal Entertainment Group Stock Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") for a total of 11,194,354 authorized shares, which provides for the granting of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to officers, employees and consultants of the Company.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P240_S1	As described below under "Restricted Stock" and "Performance Share Units" the Incentive Plan also provides for grants of restricted stock and performance shares that are subject to restrictions and risks of forfeiture.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P241_S0	In conjunction with the exchange transaction on April 12, 2002, the holders of outstanding options of United Artists and Regal Cinemas received under the Incentive Plan replacement options to purchase 8,832,147 shares of Regal Class A common stock at prices ranging from $4.44 to $12.87 per share.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P241_S1	As a result, stock option information presented herein prior to the exchange of options has been retroactively restated to reflect the effects of the exchange transaction.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P242_S0	In connection with the July 1, 2003, June 2, 2004, April 13, 2007 and December 30, 2010 extraordinary cash dividends and pursuant to the antidilution adjustment terms of the Incentive Plan, the exercise price and the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to options held by the Company's option holders were adjusted to prevent dilution and restore their economic position to that existing immediately before the extraordinary dividends.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P242_S1	The antidilution adjustments made with respect to such options resulted in a decrease in the range of exercise prices, from $2.2090 to $14.6414 per share, an increase in the aggregate number of shares issuable upon exercise of such options by 5,235,094, and an increase in the total number of authorized shares under the Incentive Plan to 18,319,207 (after giving effect to the May 11, 2005 amendment to the Incentive Plan, which increased the total number of shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance under the Incentive Plan by 1,889,759 shares).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P242_S2	As of December 30, 2010 and after giving effect to the antidilution adjustments and the May 11, 2005 amendment to the Incentive Plan, options to purchase a total of 526,742 shares of Class A common stock were outstanding under the Incentive Plan, and 1,518,284 shares remain available for future issuance under the Incentive Plan.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P242_S3	Stock option information presented herein has been adjusted to give effect to the extraordinary dividends.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P243_S0	changes made to reduce the exercise prices and increase the number of shares underlying options as a result of the extraordinary cash dividends because (1) the aggregate intrinsic value of the awards immediately after the extraordinary dividends was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value of the awards immediately before the extraordinary dividends and (2) the ratio of the exercise price per share to the market value per share was not reduced.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P244_S0	Effective December 30, 2005, the Company adopted ASC Subtopic 718-10 utilizing the modified prospective approach.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S0	Prior to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10, we accounted for stock option grants in accordance with the intrinsic value method, and accordingly, recognized no compensation expense for those stock options having an exercise price equal to the market value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of the grant.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S1	Under the modified prospective approach, ASC Subtopic 718-10 applies to awards that were outstanding on December 30, 2005 and to new awards and the modification, repurchase or cancellation of awards after December 30, 2005.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S2	Under the modified prospective approach, compensation cost recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 includes share-based compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 30, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and recognized as expense over the remaining requisite service period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S3	Share-based compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to December 30, 2005 are based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10 and recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S4	Prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S5	In addition, the Company has elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P245_S6	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P246_S0	Stock options granted in connection with the exchange transaction are generally exercisable in installments of 20% per year from the original grant date of the exchanged options and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P246_S1	Stock option grants issued subsequent to the exchange transaction have been established at prices not less than the fair market value as of the date of grant and are exercisable in installments of 20% per year and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P247_S0	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards based on factors at the date of grant.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P247_S1	Stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009 was based on the following assumptions at the dates the stock options were granted:
1168696_11_ITEM8_P248_S0	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock price.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P248_S1	The expected term of options granted is derived using the midpoint of the average vesting period and contractual life of the stock options.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P249_S0	The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the Company's employee stock options.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P249_S1	The Company does not target a specific dividend yield for its dividend payments but is required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the Black-Scholes model.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P249_S2	The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's history and expectation of future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P250_S0	There were no stock options granted during the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P251_S0	As share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it should be reduced for estimated forfeitures.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P251_S1	ASC Subtopic 718-10 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P252_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2009, the Company recognized approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to stock options.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P252_S1	Such expense is presented as a component of general and administrative expenses.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P252_S2	No compensation expense related to stock options was recorded during the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P253_S0	We receive a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised, generally for the excess of the price at which the stock is sold over the exercise price of the options.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P253_S1	We are required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P253_S2	Excess tax benefits are recorded when a deduction reported for tax return purposes for an award of equity instruments exceeds the cumulative compensation cost for the instruments recognized for financial reporting purposes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P253_S3	For the year ended December 30, 2010, our consolidated statement of cash flows reflects approximately $0.1 million of excess tax benefits as financing cash flows.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P253_S4	Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were $0.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P253_S5	The actual income tax benefit realized from stock option exercises was $0.2 million for the same period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P254_S0	The following table represents stock option activity for the year ended December 30, 2010:
1168696_11_ITEM8_P255_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at December 30, 2010 was approximately $2.0 million.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P255_S1	Total intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $0.6 million, for the years ended December 30, 2010, December 31 and 2009 and January 1, 2009, respectively.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P255_S2	As of December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company had no nonvested stock options outstanding.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P256_S0	The Company maintains the Incentive Plan which provides for restricted stock awards to officers, directors and key employees.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P256_S1	Under the Incentive Plan, shares of Class A common stock of the Company may be granted at nominal cost to officers, directors and key employees, subject to a continued employment restriction.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P256_S2	The restriction is fulfilled upon continued employment for a specified number of years (typically one to four years after the award date) and as such restrictions lapse, the award immediately vests.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P256_S3	In addition, we will receive a tax deduction when restricted stock vests.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P257_S0	The Incentive Plan participants are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares, although the sale and transfer of such shares is prohibited during the restricted period.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P266_S0	The Incentive Plan also provides for grants in the form of performance share units to officers, directors and key employees.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P266_S1	Performance share agreements are entered into between the Company and each grantee of performance share units (each, a "2006 Performance Agreement").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P266_S2	Our 2006 Performance Agreement covered performance share grants issued through the year ended January 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P266_S3	Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2006 Performance Agreement, grantees will be issued shares of restricted common stock of the Company in an amount determined by the attainment of Company performance criteria set forth in the 2006 Performance Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P266_S4	The performance criteria are tied to the average annual total shareholder returns (stock price appreciation plus dividend yield) attained ("TSRA") by the Company for each full twelve month period ending on the yearly anniversary of the grant date through the applicable calculation date (subject to the provisions contained in the Performance Agreement relating to the grantee's death, disability, retirement, termination with or without cause or the occurrence of a change of control).
1168696_11_ITEM8_P266_S5	The shares of restricted common stock received upon attainment of the performance criteria will be subject to further vesting over a period of time, provided the grantee remains a service provider to the Company during such period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P267_S0	Pursuant to the 2006 Performance Agreement, on the calculation date, the grantee will be entitled to receive a payment in an amount equal to the dividends paid by the Company with respect to a share of its Class A common stock from the grant date through the calculation date, multiplied by the number of shares of restricted common stock, if any, the grantee receives pursuant to the 2006 Performance Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P268_S0	Through fiscal 2007, 590,939 performance shares were granted under the Incentive Plan at nominal cost to officers and key employees.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P268_S1	The closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant ranged from $19.40 to $22.25 per share.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P269_S0	On January 16, 2008, 252,721 performance shares were granted under the Incentive Plan at nominal cost to officers and key employees.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P270_S0	our Class A common stock on the date of grant was $17.07 per share.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P271_S0	Each performance share represents the right to receive from 0% to 175% of the target numbers of shares of restricted common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P271_S1	The number of shares of restricted common stock earned will be determined by comparing the actual TSRA on Regal's Class A common stock on the third anniversary of the grant date to the target TSRA set forth in each respective 2006 Performance Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P271_S2	A target number of shares of restricted common stock to be earned by each eligible grantee has been established with respect to the performance share grants and is primarily based on the grantee's employee classification and base compensation, referred to as "target long-term incentive" ("Target LTI") below.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P271_S3	In addition, these awards are subject to an additional one-year vesting requirement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P272_S0	The Company has developed a performance range around the target TSRA and the number of shares of restricted stock that will be issued will be based on actual TSRA, according to the following schedule:
1168696_11_ITEM8_P273_S0	Since these performance shares contain a market condition which should be reflected in the grant date fair value of an award in accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, these performance shares were measured on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P273_S1	The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the performance shares granted.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P273_S2	The key assumptions used for valuing these performance share awards follow:
1168696_11_ITEM8_P274_S0	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's dividend adjusted common stock price measured daily over a three year period ending on the respective grant dates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P274_S1	The risk-free interest rate is set equal to the yield on three-year (constant maturity) U.S. Government bonds as of June 1, 2006, January 10, 2007 and January 16, 2008.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P275_S0	The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's history and expectation of future dividend payouts.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P275_S1	The dividend yield is included in the calculation of returns for measurement against the performance goals defined above.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P276_S0	In 2009, we adopted an amended and restated form of Performance Agreement (each, a "2009 Performance Agreement").
1168696_11_ITEM8_P276_S1	On January 14, 2009, 401,907 performance shares were granted under our Incentive Plan, at nominal cost to officers and key employees.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P277_S0	Under the 2009 Performance Agreement, which is described in the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis Elements of Compensation Performance Shares," of our 2009 proxy statement, each performance share represents the right to receive from 0% to 150% of the target numbers of shares of restricted Class A common stock.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P277_S1	The number of shares of restricted common stock earned will be determined based on the attainment of specified performance goals by January 14, 2012 (the third anniversary of the grant date for the January 14, 2009 grant) and January 13, 2013 (the third anniversary of the grant date for the January 13, 2010 grant) as set forth in the 2009 Performance Agreement.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P277_S2	Such performance shares vest on the fourth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P277_S3	The shares are subject to the terms and conditions of the Incentive Plan.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P277_S4	The closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of this grant was $10.01 per share on January 14, 2009 and $14.72 per share on January 13, 2010, which approximates the respective grant date fair value of the awards.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P278_S0	During the year ended December 30, 2010, 183,430 performance share awards were effectively cancelled.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P278_S1	These awards were scheduled to vest on June 1, 2010, the one year anniversary of the calculation date.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P278_S2	As of the calculation date, which was June 1, 2009, threshold performance goals were not satisfied, and therefore, all 183,430 restricted shares under this performance grant were cancelled as of June 1, 2010.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P278_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2009, 175,860 performance share awards were effectively cancelled.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P278_S4	These awards were scheduled to vest on the calculation date of June 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P278_S5	As of June 1, 2009, threshold performance goals were not satisfied, and therefore, all 175,860 restricted shares under this performance grant were cancelled as of June 1, 2009.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P279_S0	As of the respective grant dates, the aggregate fair value of the performance share awards was determined to be $17.8 million, which includes related dividends on shares ultimately earned and paid on the third anniversary of the respective grant dates.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P279_S1	The fair value of the performance share awards are amortized as compensation expense over the expected terms of the awards, which range from 3 to 4 years.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P279_S2	During the years ended December 30, 2010, January 1, 2009 and December 27, 2007, the Company recognized approximately $4.0 million, $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to performance share grants.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P294_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P294_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P294_S2	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, restricted stock and performance shares, the conversion spread on the 3 3 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, the 2003 Warrant, the assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes and the 2008 Warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P294_S3	The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted shares and performance shares, the conversion spread on the 3 3 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes, the 2003 Warrant and the 2008 Warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P294_S4	The dilutive effect of assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method.

1168696_11_ITEM8_P295_S1	The undistributed earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the periods presented had been distributed.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P295_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_11_ITEM8_P295_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.

1168696_11_ITEM15_P56_S3	The correction has no effect on total assets, total liabilities, total equity/(deficit), the Statements of Operations, or the Cash Flows from Operations.

1168696_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Company's fiscal year ends on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2008) results in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	For fiscal 2011, we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $2,681.7 million, $221.3 million and $40.3 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	In addition, we generated $353.1 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Key elements of our business strategy include:
1168696_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 29, 2011, we have returned approximately $3.3 billion to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction that meets our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	We also intend to enhance our theatre operations by selectively expanding and upgrading existing properties in prime locations.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We continue to embrace innovative concepts to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts:
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	First, during fiscal 2011, we completed our deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems across our circuit.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	As of December 29, 2011, we operated 4,721 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 2,784 of which are digital 3D capable (approximately 42% of our total screens).
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	We expect substantially all of our screens to be outfitted with digital projection systems by late 2012 or early 2013.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	In addition, we continued to expand our IMAX footprint by installing an additional 16 IMAX digital projection systems during fiscal 2011, bringing our total to 66 IMAX screens as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	We believe that expanding our IMAX footprint will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S5	Finally, during fiscal 2011, we added our proprietary large screen format known as "Regal Premium Experience" ("RPX (SM) ") to 10 auditoriums, bringing our total to 17 RPX (SM) screens as of as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S6	We have been encouraged by the results of RPX (SM) screens and expect to expand our RPX (SM) footprint to between 30 and 35 auditoriums by the end of 2012.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S7	We believe the installation of 3D digital projection systems and IMAX theatres systems and the conversion of existing auditoriums to RPX (SM) auditoriums allow us to offer our patrons premium 3D movies and all-digital large format experiences that we believe generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S8	We are pleased with the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to 3D film product and other 3D content and with the continued support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S9	Second, to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and beverage products to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, healthy snacks, alcohol and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S10	To that end, during fiscal 2011, we introduced several new items including boneless chicken wings, cheese sticks, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and jalapeno poppers in approximately 28 theatres and also offer beer and wine in other locations.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S11	In addition, as of December 29, 2011, we have successfully launched five Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S12	We believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our attendance and operating results and expect to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres during fiscal 2012 and beyond.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S13	Third, we continued our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S14	For example, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , in all of our markets.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S15	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P9_S16	As of December 29, 2011, we had over six million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs, such as selective discounting of ticket and concession prices in certain markets, summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	We plan to use these programs in future markets where we believe patron loyalty can be further enhanced, and will continue to evaluate our markets on a case-by-case basis to determine the suitability of these programs in individual regions.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives, such as DCIP, Open Road Films and National CineMedia, LLC.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	For example, during fiscal 2011, we announced the creation of Open Road Films, a new film distribution company that is jointly owned by us and AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC").
1168696_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that Open Road Films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios' big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	Open Road Films released its first film, The Killer Elite , in late September 2011 and its second film, The Grey , in January 2012 and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	As of December 29, 2011, we have invested approximately $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and ultimately expect to invest up to $30.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM").
1168696_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre network in North America representing approximately 18,700 U.S. theatres screens (of which approximately 17,700 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 29, 2011 and reaching over 670 million movie guests annually.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	National CineMedia primarily concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC, and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe our investment in National CineMedia will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	In summary, we believe our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatres assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities:
1168696_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are the largest domestic motion picture exhibitor operating 6,614 screens in 527 theatres in 37 states and the District of Columbia.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We have developed a proven operating philosophy focused on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Since our 2002 initial public offering, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of seven theatre circuits, consisting of 157 theatres and 1,808 screens.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	We have generally achieved immediate cost savings at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	As of December 29, 2011, approximately 83% of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating and approximately 87% of our screens were located in theatres with 10 or more screens.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our theatres have an average of 12.6 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	We believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	We believe that our theatre circuit will be further enhanced with the installation of digital projection systems in our theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	To that end, during fiscal 2011, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $129.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	Further, on February 13, 2012, we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2012 to our stockholders of record on March 5, 2012.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S4	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S5	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S6	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P24_S7	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our board of directors.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and, consequently, box office revenues.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	We expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	More recently, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering films to consumers, including cable television, in-home video and DVD, satellite and pay-per-view services such as video on demand and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its in-home video or DVD release has remained relatively stable.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	The domestic motion picture industry is in the process of converting from film-based media to electronic-based media, including the distribution of feature films in a digital format rather than a 35 mm film format.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Virtually all entertainment content today can be exhibited digitally.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	Digital projection produces a consistent state-of-the-art presentation for patrons as there is no degradation of image over the exhibition period of the motion picture.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that operating a digital theatre circuit has enabled us to generate incremental revenue from differentiated motion picture formats such as digital 3D, IMAX and RPX (SM) , generate additional revenue from exhibition of specialty content offerings and provide greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which we expect will enhance our capacity utilization.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S4	Given our market presence, the overall diversity of our patron base and our high average screen per theatre count, we believe the benefits associated with digital technologies will be significant for our theatre circuit and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S5	We are pleased with the benefits and future potential of digital cinema primarily as it relates to 3D film product and other 3D content and with the continued support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S6	As directors and producers continue to embrace new technology in their productions, we expect new and innovative content generation to continue.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S7	To that end, during 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, formed Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), to create a financing model and execute agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S8	During fiscal 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S9	During fiscal 2011, we completed our deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to theatres across our circuit.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S10	As of December 29, 2011, we operated 4,721 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 2,784 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P29_S11	See "Digital Cinema Implementation Partners Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this joint venture arrangement.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We believe a modern megaplex featuring stadium seating is preferred by patrons over a sloped-floor multiplex theatre, the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	We believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	We also believe that another evolution of theatre formats beyond the current megaplex is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	We operate the largest theatre circuit in the United States with 6,614 screens in 527 theatres in 37 states and the District of Columbia as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	We operate theatres in 43 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas, which include locations in suburban growth areas.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Edwards brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	floor-to-ceiling screens, Sony Digital Cinema 4K projection systems, digital stereo surround-sound, closed-captioning, multi-station concessions stands, computerized ticketing systems, plush stadium seating with cup holders and retractable armrests, enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enables us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising, rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P34_S3	We stagger movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and lobby congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P34_S4	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P34_S5	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks and e-gift cards.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state and the District of Columbia as of December 29, 2011:
1168696_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have implemented a best practices management program across all of our theatres, including daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management reports generated for each individual theatre and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers regularly inspect each theatre.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	We also operate a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre network in North America representing approximately 18,700 U.S. theatres screens (of which approximately 17,700 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 29, 2011 and reaching over 670 million movie guests annually.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	National CineMedia primarily concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), a newly formed entity that serves as the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	In connection with the IPO of NCM, Inc., RCM, through its wholly owned subsidiary Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC ("RCH"), AMC and Cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of National CineMedia and other ancillary agreements.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	As a result of these agreements, we receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Subsequent to the IPO of NCM, Inc. and through December 29, 2011, the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 5.1 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	These transactions, when combined with the redemption of approximately 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, caused a net increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to 22.1 million common units.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	On February 12, 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, formed DCIP to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema in our theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	DCIP's financing raised approximately $660.0 million, consisting of approximately $445.0 million in senior bank debt, approximately $135.0 million in additional junior capital and approximately $80.0 million in equity contributions (consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems) from us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	Concurrent with closing, the Company entered into a master equipment lease agreement (the "Master Lease") and other related agreements (collectively, the "Digital Cinema Agreements") with Kasima, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DCIP.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	After giving effect to the DCIP Contributions, the Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 29, 2011, while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Since the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it will continue to account for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	DCIP's initial financing described above, coupled with a second round of financing completed in March 2011(which consisted of a new $220.0 million term loan facility), will cover the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	DCIP funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	We bear operating and maintenance costs with respect to digital projection systems in our theatres, which is relatively comparable to what we historically spent on our conventional film projectors.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	As of December 29, 2011, we operated 4,721 screens outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P45_S4	We expect to outfit substantially all of our screens with digital projection systems by late 2012 or early 2013.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P45_S5	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	We maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a new film distribution company that is jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe that Open Road Films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios' big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	Open Road Films released its first film, The Killer Elite , in late September 2011 and its second film, The Grey , in January 2012 and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	As of December 29, 2011, we have invested approximately $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and ultimately expect to invest up to $30.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of December 29, 2011 was approximately $5.2 million.
1168696_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves a significant degree of risk.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	For fiscal 2011, our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately $381.5 million and $149.7 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As of December 29, 2011, we had total debt obligations of $2,016.3 million.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	As of December 29, 2011, we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,148.2 million.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	For a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments" provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	As a result, inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Many of our lease agreements and the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a lease or debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other leases and debt instruments.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce ticket prices.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We also compete with other movie delivery vehicles, including cable television, downloads via the Internet, in-home video and DVD, satellite and pay-per-view services such as video on demand.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other delivery vehicles during the theatrical release window.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The theatrical release window has been stable over the past five to six years.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of, these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with ten major film distributors accounting for approximately 93% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P9_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the ten major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Generally, stadium seating found in modern megaplex theatres is preferred by patrons over slope-floored multiplex theatres, which were the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Although, as of December 29, 2011, approximately 83% of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating, we still serve many markets with sloped-floored multiplex theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	These theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres, and should other theatre operators choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets, the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In addition, should other theatre operators return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken in the late 1990's, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may not benefit from our strategic acquisition strategy and partnerships.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In the case of acquisitions, even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to service debt incurred to finance an acquisition, our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We also selectively pursue theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	As of December 29, 2011, we owned approximately 19.9% of National CineMedia, and participate in joint ventures such as DCIP and Open Road Films.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The difficulties and uncertainties associated with identifying investment and partnership opportunities that will successfully enhance and utilize our existing asset base in a manner that contributes to cost savings and revenue enhancement; Our inability to exercise complete voting control over the partnerships and joint ventures in which we participate; and Our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, Open Road Films or other ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A prolonged economic downturn could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by prolonged negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending, including those resulting from terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If economic conditions become weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres, including delaying the deployment of new projection and other technologies to our theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	For example, our future ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Anschutz Company owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As a result, as of December 29, 2011, Anschutz Company controlled approximately 78% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	For as long as Anschutz Company continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Anschutz Company will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to Anschutz Company but not to other stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S5	In addition, Anschutz Company and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P29_S6	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	As of February 20, 2012, we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Anschutz Company is able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by Anschutz Company or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Regal is a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries, or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the subsidiaries' earnings and are subject to various business considerations.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2018 (the "9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_12_ITEM1B_P0_S0	As of December 29, 2011, there are no unresolved comments from the Commission regarding any of our periodic or current reports filed under the Exchange Act.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 29, 2011, we operated 468 theatre locations pursuant to lease agreements and owned the land and buildings in fee for 59 theatre locations.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	For a list of the states in which we operated theatres and the number of theatres and screens operated in each such state as of December 29, 2011, please see the chart under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the caption "Business Theatre Operations", which is incorporated herein by reference.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 years.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P1_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_12_ITEM2_P1_S5	We believe that these facilities are adequate for our operations.
1168696_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Pursuant to General Instruction G(2) to Form 10-K and Rule 12b-23 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the information required to be furnished by us under this Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) is incorporated by reference to the information contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common equity consists of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	There is no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	On February 20, 2012, there were approximately 257 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and one stockholder of record of our Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	Additionally, as of February 20, 2012, approximately 437,508 shares of our Class A common stock are issuable upon exercise of stock options that vest and are exercisable at various dates through June 23, 2014, with exercise prices ranging from $4.4134 to $14.6414.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	All such options were exercisable as of February 20, 2012.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P3_S2	Finally, as of February 20, 2012 our officers, directors and key employees hold, or in the case of performance shares are eligible to receive, approximately 2,180,333 restricted shares of our Class A common stock, for which the restrictions lapse or the performance criteria and vesting may be satisfied, at various dates through January 11, 2016.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P3_S3	All shares underlying outstanding options and all shares of restricted stock are registered and will be freely tradable when the option is exercised, in the case of restricted stock when the restrictions lapse, or, in the case of performance shares when the performance criteria and vesting are satisfied, unless such shares are acquired by an affiliate of Regal, in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	During fiscal 2011, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $129.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	During fiscal 2010, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.18 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $111.1 million in the aggregate.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	In addition, on December 30, 2010, Regal paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.40 per share on each outstanding share of its Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $216.0 million.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S3	On February 13, 2012, we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S4	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2012 to our stockholders of record on March 5, 2012.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S5	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S6	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S7	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_12_ITEM5_P4_S8	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	We present below selected historical consolidated financial data for Regal based on historical data, for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates, (i) the fiscal year ended December 27, 2007, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards and Hoyts, (ii) the fiscal year ended January 1, 2009, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts and the results of operations of the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres on April 30, 2008 for the period subsequent to the acquisition date, (iii) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts and the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres from January 2, 2009, (iv) the fiscal year ended December 30, 2010, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres from January 1, 2010 and the eight theatres acquired from AMC on May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010 for periods subsequent to their acquisition dates and (v) the fiscal year ended December 29, 2011, considering the results of United Artists, Regal Cinemas, Edwards, Hoyts, the 28 theatres acquired from Consolidated Theatres and the eight theatres acquired from AMC on May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010 from December 31, 2010.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	The fiscal year ended January 1, 2009 consisted of 53 weeks of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P0_S2	The selected historical consolidated financial data as of and for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, January 1, 2009 and December 27, 2007 were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Regal and the notes thereto.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P0_S3	The selected historical financial data do not necessarily indicate the operating results or financial position that would have resulted from our operations on a combined basis during the periods presented, nor is the historical data necessarily indicative of any future operating results or financial position of Regal.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P0_S4	In addition to the below selected financial data, you should also refer to the more complete financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) Fiscal year ended January 1, 2009 was comprised of 53 weeks.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	(2) Includes the December 30, 2010 payment of the $1.40 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P1_S2	(3) Includes the April 13, 2007 payment of the $2.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P1_S3	(4) On February 13, 2007, NCM, Inc., the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P1_S4	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P1_S5	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	As a result of the NCM, Inc.'s acquisition of common units in National CineMedia, the Company recognized a change in interest gain of approximately $182.7 million along with a corresponding increase in the Company's equity investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P2_S3	Regal sold approximately 1.6 million common units to NCM, Inc. for proceeds of approximately $32.2 million and recognized a gain on the sale of such units of approximately $19.3 million.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P2_S4	Upon the closing of the IPO, National CineMedia entered into a $725.0 million term loan facility, the net cash proceeds of which were used to redeem preferred units issued to each of Regal, AMC and Cinemark on a pro rata basis pursuant to a recapitalization of National CineMedia prior to completion of the IPO.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P2_S5	We received approximately $315.1 million as a result of the preferred unit redemption.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	investment in National CineMedia from approximately $166.4 million to zero and (2) recording distributions in excess of the investment balance in National CineMedia of approximately $148.7 million as a gain.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	After the payment of current taxes, net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled approximately $447.4 million.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	(5) During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we redeemed 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $14.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	We received approximately $66.0 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $52.0 million.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S2	(6) During the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, January 1, 2009 and December 27, 2007, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $17.9 million, $10.3 million, $15.3 million, $22.4 million and $6.8 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S3	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S4	(7) During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S5	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S6	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. (1,222,780 shares) to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM6_P4_S7	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of Regal Entertainment Group for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 6,614 screens in 527 theatres in 37 states and the District of Columbia as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which concentrates on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and discount ticket programs and various other activities in our theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	In addition, National CineMedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on-screen advertising, concerts and other events.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Film rental costs depend on a variety of factors, including the prospects of a film, the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company's revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The unexpected emergence or continuance of a "hit" film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	The Company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P12_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	We estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	determined by a film's initial box office receipts.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	As a result, there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable, because we make such estimates based on each film's box office receipts through the end of the reporting period.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	For the fiscal years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of 30 years.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life, and their depreciable lives (12-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_12_ITEM7_P19_S8	For example, in connection with our deployment of leased digital projection systems to theatres across our circuit, the Company has accelerated depreciation of its owned 35mm film projection equipment that is scheduled to be replaced with leased digital projection systems, with such depreciation occurring over the expected deployment schedule since the Company plans to dispose of such equipment prior to the end of its useful life.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company is exposed to various market risks including interest rate risk and equity price risk.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company's interest rate risk is confined to interest rate exposure of its and its wholly owned subsidiaries' debt obligations that bear interest based on floating rates.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Amended Senior Credit Facility provides variable rate interest that could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Borrowings under the New Term Loans bear interest, at Regal Cinemas' option, at either a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate or the base rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Under the terms of the Company's effective interest rate swap agreements (which hedge an aggregate of $800.0 million of variable rate debt obligations as of December 29, 2011) described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from 2.22% to 2.53% and receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, borrowings of $998.5 million and $1,232.5 million (net of debt discount), respectively, were outstanding under the New Term Loans at an effective interest rate of 4.96% (as of December 29, 2011) and 5.42% (as of December 30, 2010), after the impact of the interest rate swaps is taken into account.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company's effective interest rate under the New Term Loans as of December 29, 2011, would increase or decrease interest expense by $5.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	In addition, the Company is exposed to equity price risk associated with approximately 1.2 million shares of stock held in RealD, Inc. as described further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such shares of stock are accounted for as available for sale securities with recurring fair value adjustments recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss/income (net of related tax effects).
1168696_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of such controls as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, our management believes that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm of the Company's consolidated financial statements, has issued an audit report on management's assertion with respect to the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2011, as stated in their report which is included herein.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, deficit and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	We also have audited Regal Entertainment Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	Regal Entertainment Group's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1168696_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P6_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P6_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company generally recognizes payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor programs as revenue in the period in which the related impressions are delivered.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P19_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P19_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	During the years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, the Company capitalized approximately $11.4 million and $9.3 million of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	As of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, included in property and equipment is $104.1 million and $104.3 million, respectively, of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $58.2 million and $53.3 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities described below, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P27_S2	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	This analysis resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $17.9 million, $10.3 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 15 to 20 years.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	Certain leases for Company theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P35_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 was approximately $178.8 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the Company is required to reallocate the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 indicated that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	As of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, intangible assets totaled $32.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively, before accumulated amortization of $11.7 million and $10.3 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Intangible assets are recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	In connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres in fiscal 2008, the Company acquired certain identifiable intangible assets, including $9.9 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 13.1 years and approximately $8.2 million related to an on-screen advertising contract which was amortized on a straight-line basis through January 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P46_S2	During the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company recognized $1.4 million, $3.9 million and $3.8 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P46_S3	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 29, 2011 is projected below:
1168696_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Other non-current assets include debt acquisition costs, which are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	Debt acquisition costs as of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 were $36.0 million and $51.8 million, respectively, before accumulated amortization of $12.4 million and $19.4 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using the equity method of accounting and has recorded the investments within "Other Non-Current Assets" in its consolidated balance sheets.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and RealD, Inc. and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	As described in Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments," during the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. (1,222,780 shares) to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	There was no impairment of the Company's other investments during the years December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P54_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	Certain interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter, until expiration.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P59_S2	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P59_S3	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P59_S4	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P59_S5	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement will be amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	As of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, approximately $343.5 million and $339.2 million of deferred revenue related to the ESA was recorded as a component of non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P62_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at one of the Company's theatres and earn concession or ticket awards based on the number of credits accumulated.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	Start-up costs associated with a new theatre are also expensed as incurred.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock And Share-Based Compensation," we apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall .
1168696_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	As of December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company managed its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Total comprehensive income for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was $43.4 million, $75.7 million and $95.1 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income attributable to controlling interest and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangements and the change in fair value of available-for-sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments) during each of the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2009 and 2010 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2011 presentation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which amends SFAS No. 133, and requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information about how and why a company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format, information about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk, and the company's strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P74_S2	The Statement expands the current disclosure framework in SFAS No. 133.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P74_S3	The Company adopted SFAS No. 161 during the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P74_S4	The adoption of SFAS No. 161 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165, Subsequent Events, which establishes reporting and disclosure requirements based on the existence of conditions at the date of the balance sheet for events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	Companies are required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	During June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) which is to be adopted as of the beginning of its first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, and interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	No. 167 amends FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46(R)") to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise's variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics:
1168696_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and b.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to add an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	amends FIN 46(R) to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise's involvement in a variable interest entity.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	The enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	The adoption of SFAS No. 167 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	SFAS No. 168 will become the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force, and related accounting literature.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	No. 168 reorganizes the thousands of GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P82_S3	Also included is relevant Commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	SFAS No. 168 was effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods that end after September 15, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance as of October 1, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	The adoption did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements , ("ASU 2010-06").
1168696_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	This Update provides a greater level of disaggregated information and enhanced disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009 and became effective for the Company as of April 1, 2010 except for certain disclosure requirements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	Disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years and became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance under ASC Topic 220, Presentation of Comprehensive Income , to amend the presentation of comprehensive income to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P86_S1	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P86_S2	The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P86_S3	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and is to be applied retrospectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P86_S4	Because this guidance impacts presentation only, it will have no effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment ("ASU 2011-08"), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P87_S2	If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	ASU 2011-08 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P88_S1	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-08 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial results.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	On May 24, 2010 and June 24, 2010, the Company acquired eight theatres with 106 screens located in Illinois, Indiana and Colorado from an affiliate of AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC").
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	The Company purchased five of these AMC theatres representing 63 screens for approximately $55.0 million in cash and acquired the other three AMC theatres representing 43 screens in exchange for two Regal theatres consisting of 26 screens.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S2	As of the acquisition date, the exchanged Regal theatres had a net book value of approximately $0.2 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S3	The Company accounted for the exchanged theatre assets as a non-monetary transaction and as such, allocated the net book value of the Regal theatres to the exchanged AMC theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S4	Total cash paid of approximately $55.0 million was directly allocated to the other five AMC theatres using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S5	Accordingly, the total cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S6	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including an independent third party valuation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P89_S7	The results of operations of the eight acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	The following is a summary of the final allocation of the aggregate cash purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the respective dates of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	The transaction included the acquisition of certain identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $14.4 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 35 years.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	On February 12, 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark") formed a joint venture company known as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("DCIP"), to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema in our theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P92_S1	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	Concurrent with closing, the Company entered into a master equipment lease agreement (the "Master Lease") and other related agreements (collectively, the "Digital Cinema Agreements") with Kasima, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DCIP.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	Upon execution of the Digital Cinema Agreements, the Company made equity contributions to DCIP of approximately $41.7 million, consisting of $29.1 million in cash and 200 existing digital projection systems with a fair value of approximately $12.6 million (collectively, the "DCIP Contributions").
1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S3	The Company recorded such DCIP Contributions as an increase in its investment in DCIP.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S4	In connection with the contribution of its 200 existing digital projection systems, the Company recorded a loss on the contribution of $2.0 million based on the excess of the carrying value of the digital projection systems contributed over the $12.6 million fair value (as determined by an independent appraisal) of such equipment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S5	In addition, during May 2010, Regal sold an additional 337 digital projection systems to DCIP for aggregate proceeds of approximately $20.0 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S6	In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a loss on disposal of approximately $2.8 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P93_S7	Such losses were presented as a component of "Net loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets and other" in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	After giving effect to the DCIP Contributions, the Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 29, 2011, while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	Since the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it will continue to account for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P94_S2	The Company's investment in DCIP is included as a component of "Other Non-Current Assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	Through December 31, 2009, the Company effected cumulative cash equity contributions totaling $8.0 million and recorded cumulative equity losses in DCIP of $7.3 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	The changes in the carrying amount of our investment in DCIP for the years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 are as follows (in millions):
1168696_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	(1) During the year ended December 29, 2011, the Company effected additional cash investments in DCIP of approximately $17.4 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	In addition to cash investments in DCIP totaling $0.7 million, upon execution of the Digital Cinema Agreements, the Company effected additional equity contributions to DCIP of approximately $41.7 million, consisting of cash and existing digital projection systems, during the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	Such amount is presented as a component of "Other, net" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	DCIP funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	In accordance with the Master Lease, the digital projection systems are leased from Kasima, LLC under a twelve-year term with ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S2	The Master Lease also contains a fair value purchase option.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S3	Under the Master Lease, the Company pays annual minimum rent of $1,000 per digital projection system from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term and is, upon certain conditions described below, subject to incremental annual rent of $2,000 per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S4	In the event that the junior capital raised by DCIP in the initial financing transactions remains outstanding at any time on or after the date that is six and a half years after the closing date of March 2010, the holders of the related notes will have the right to require the Company and other participating exhibitors to make incremental minimum rent payments of $2,000 per digital projection system per year through the earlier of the end of the lease term or until such notes are repaid.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S5	The Company considers both the $1,000 minimum rental and the incremental minimum rental payment of $2,000 per digital projection system to be minimum rents and accordingly has recorded such rents on a straight-line basis in its consolidated financial statements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S6	The Company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the Master Lease.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S7	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S8	The Company accounts for the Master Lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P98_S9	During the years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, the Company incurred total rent of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively, associated with the leased digital projection systems.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	During June 2011, we completed our deployment of 3D compatible digital projection systems to theatres across our circuit.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Company has accelerated depreciation of its owned 35mm film projection equipment that is scheduled to be replaced with leased digital projection systems, with such depreciation occurring over the expected deployment schedule since the Company plans to dispose of such equipment prior to the end of its useful life.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	To that end, during the years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, the Company recorded approximately $7.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation related to such 35mm film projection equipment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	As of December 29, 2011, we operated 4,721 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 2,784 of which are digital 3D capable.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM").
1168696_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	National CineMedia primarily concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S3	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S4	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_12_ITEM8_P105_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one-to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	Accordingly, we will not provide for any additional losses as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P106_S2	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P106_S3	Until such time, equity earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	The modification extended the term of the exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") to 30 years, provided National CineMedia with a five-year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.07 payment per patron which will increase by 8% every five years starting at the end of fiscal 2011 and a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which will increase by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $972 for fiscal 2011).
1168696_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P110_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P110_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P110_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million, which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P111_S2	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	Under the units of revenue method, amortization for a period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the ESA modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement was created to account for changes in the number of theatre screens operated by each of the joint venture partners.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	Historically, each of the joint venture partners has increased the number of screens it operates through acquisitions and newly built theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	Since the increased attendance associated with these incremental screens in turn provides for additional advertising revenues to National CineMedia, National CineMedia agreed to compensate the joint venture partners by issuing additional common membership units to the joint venture partners in consideration for their increased attendance from newly built theatres and acquisitions and overall contribution to the joint venture.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	As a result, each joint venture partner's equity ownership interests are proportionately adjusted to reflect the risks and rewards relative to their contributions to the joint venture.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement provides that transfers of common units are solely between the joint venture partners and National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	There are no transfers of units among the joint venture partners.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P116_S2	In addition, there are no circumstances under which common units would be surrendered by the Company to National CineMedia in the event of an acquisition by one of the joint venture partners.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P116_S3	However, adjustments to the common units owned by one of the joint venture partners will result in an adjustment to the Company's equity ownership interest percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P117_S1	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P117_S2	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 29, 2011, the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 5.1 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P119_S2	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P119_S3	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S1	On the IPO date, NCM, Inc., the Company, AMC and Cinemark entered into a tax receivable agreement.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, NCM, Inc. will make cash payments to us, AMC and Cinemark in amounts equal to 90% of NCM, Inc.'s actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the intangible assets described above.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S3	For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax will be computed by comparing NCM, Inc.'s actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NCM, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase in NCM Inc.'s proportionate share of tax basis in NCM's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S4	The tax receivable agreement shall generally apply to NCM, Inc.'s taxable years up to and including the 30 th anniversary date of the NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S5	Pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, the Company received payments of $7.0 million from NCM, Inc. during the year ended December 29, 2011 with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2009 and 2010 taxable years.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S7	Finally, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company received payments of $5.7 million with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2008 taxable year.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P120_S8	Such payments are accounted for using the equity method as described further below.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company accounts for its investment in National CineMedia following the equity method of accounting and such investment is included as a component of "Other Non-Current Assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	Such deferred revenue amounts are being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA between RCI and National CineMedia following the units of revenue method as described in (4) below.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P124_S3	These transactions caused a proportionate increase in the Company's Additional Investments Tranche and increased our ownership share in National CineMedia to 22.1 million common units.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P124_S4	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	Since Consolidated Theatres maintains an existing agreement with an on-screen advertising provider, National CineMedia will not be provided access to such theatre locations until expiration of the related advertising contract.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P125_S1	In accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, Regal agreed to pay National CineMedia an amount that approximates the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that would have been generated by National CineMedia if it were able to sell on-screen advertising in the acquired theatre locations on an exclusive basis.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P125_S2	The fair value of the screen integration payment was approximately $8.0 million and was accrued by the Company during 2008.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P125_S3	Such amount was determined by the present value of the ultimate amount estimated to be paid to National CineMedia (approximately $8.9 million) through expiration of the on-screen advertising contract.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P125_S4	The accretion associated with this obligation was reflected in interest expense over the life of the related obligation.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P126_S2	The remaining amounts were recognized in equity earnings during each of these periods and have been included as components of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P164_S1	As a result, interest expense is imputed and recognized based upon the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate, which resulted in incremental non-cash interest expense.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P164_S2	During the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company recorded approximately $0.3 million, $3.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of non-cash interest expense on the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, Regal Cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two to three years each from the respective effective dates of the swaps, which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 2.15% to 2.53% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P165_S1	These four interest rate swap agreements were designated to hedge $1,000.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate 5.82% as of December 30, 2010.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	On September 30, 2011, one of the interest rate swaps designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations matured.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	The 3-month LIBOR rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate-swaps for the following three-month period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter, until expiration.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P169_S1	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the Company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the 3-month LIBOR on $800.0 million of variable rate obligations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	The change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_12_ITEM8_P170_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the designated hedging instruments (the three interest rate swaps) will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	During the quarter ended September 29, 2011, Regal Cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of June 30, 2012 and a maturity term of three years from the effective date of the swap.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P171_S2	The interest rate swap is designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P171_S3	In addition, during the quarter ended December 29, 2011, Regal Cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of December 31, 2012 and a maturity term of three years from the effective date of the swap.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P171_S4	The swap will require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at a fixed rate of 1.325% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P171_S5	The interest rate swap is designated to hedge $100.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	See Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	Rent expense under such operating leases amounted to $381.5 million, $382.3 million and $378.8 million for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P176_S1	Contingent rent expense was $20.4 million, $22.4 million and $22.3 million for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	The Company has historically entered into sale and leaseback transactions whereby owned properties were sold and leased back under operating leases.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P177_S1	The minimum rentals for these operating leases are included in the table above.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	In December 1995, United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ("UATC") entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby 31 owned properties were sold to and leased back from an unaffiliated third party.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P178_S1	In conjunction with the transaction, the buyer of the properties issued publicly traded pass-through certificates.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P178_S2	In connection with this sale and leaseback transaction, UATC entered into a Participation Agreement that requires UATC to comply with various covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, guarantees, issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries and subsidiary distributions, transfer of assets and payment of dividends.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P178_S3	As of December 29, 2011, 11 theatres were subject to the sale leaseback transaction and approximately $26.9 million in principal amount of pass-through certificates were outstanding.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes for income from operations are as follows (in millions):

1168696_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes as reported and the amount computed by multiplying the income before taxes and extraordinary item by the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% was as follows (in millions):
1168696_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax asset consisted of the following at (in millions):
1168696_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	At December 29, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $61.6 million with expiration commencing in 2018 and tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $0.8 million expiring in 2031.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Company's net operating loss carryforwards were generated by the entities of United Artists, Edwards and Hoyts.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an "ownership change" of a corporation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P184_S1	Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize the net operating losses acquired from United Artists, Edwards and Hoyts may be impaired as a result of the "ownership change" limitations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	In assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P185_S2	The Company maintains a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $16.0 million and $15.6 million as of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, respectively, as management believes it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in future tax periods.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P185_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P185_S4	During the year ended December 29, 2011, the valuation allowance was increased by $1.0 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created during the year ended December 29, 2011 would not be realized.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	December 29, 2011, the valuation allowance was decreased by $0.6 million primarily related to the realization of certain state net operating losses created in years ended before December 29, 2011.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P187_S1	A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 was as follows (in millions):
1168696_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $8.0 million and $8.5 million within the next twelve months due the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P189_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, were $12.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P189_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 were approximately $1.7 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P190_S1	As of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, the Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of approximately $3.6 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P190_S2	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of income for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 was $(0.8) million, $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries collectively file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P191_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	As further described Note 4 "Investments," the Company maintains an investment in National CineMedia, a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P192_S1	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently examining National CineMedia's 2007 and 2008 income tax returns and, as of December 29, 2011, has proposed an adjustment related to agreements entered into in conjunction with NCM Inc.'s IPO.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P192_S2	Management is currently evaluating the proposed adjustment but does not anticipate the adjustment would result in a material change to the Company's results of operations or financial position.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	benefits related to this position may be necessary within the next twelve months, however the amount of such unrecognized tax benefits is not reasonably estimable as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	The Company is presently involved in various judicial, administrative, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business operations, including but not limited to, personal injury claims, landlord-tenant disputes, employment and other contractual matters, some of which are described below.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P194_S1	Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	With respect to certain matters described herein, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss to be approximately $2.5 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P195_S1	Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Company believes the risk of loss is more than slight.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for cases described below in which damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal issues presented.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P196_S1	However, for these cases, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the Company's operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P197_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	In prior years, private litigants and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") had filed claims against the Company alleging that a number of theatres with stadium seating violated the ADA because these theatres allegedly failed to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with lines of sight comparable to those available to other members of the general public and denied persons in wheelchairs access to the stadium portion of the theatres.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P198_S1	On June 8, 2005, Regal reached an agreement with the DOJ resolving and dismissing the private litigants' claims and all claims made by the United States under the ADA.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P198_S2	On December 9, 2010, the parties renewed the Consent Decree for another three year term.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	In these instances, the Company seeks to resolve or dismiss these claims based on the terms of the DOJ settlement or under applicable ADA standards.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P200_S1	The Company intends to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth above, does not currently anticipate that compliance will require the Company to expend substantial funds.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	In addition, from time to time, the Company receives letters from the state officials in states where we operate theatres regarding investigation into the accessibility of theatres to persons with visual impairments or that are deaf or hard of hearing.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	On July 20, 2010, the DOJ issued Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the provision of closed captioning and descriptive audio within the theatre environment.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P202_S1	Significantly, this is the first time the DOJ has stated that open captioning may not be required by the ADA.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P202_S2	However, by so stating, the DOJ has implied that closed captioning may be required.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P202_S3	The Company believes it provides the members of the visually and hearing impaired communities with reasonable access to the movie-going experience but has announced its intention to deploy new digital captioning and descriptive video systems during 2012 and 2013 that should meet all such potential requirements or expectations of any federal, state or individual concerns.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P202_S4	The Company expects the capital outlay with respect to these systems to be approximately $11.5 million.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	The Company's theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	In situations where management believes that a loss arising from such proceedings is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no amount within the range is more probable than another.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these proceedings is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P204_S2	The amounts reserved for such proceedings (primarily landlord-tenant disputes) totaled approximately $8.2 million as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P204_S3	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	Under each of the employment contracts, the Company must indemnify each executive from and against all liabilities with respect to such executive's service as an officer, and as a director, to the extent applicable.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P209_S1	Each Executive is also subject to a permanent covenant to maintain confidentiality of the Company's confidential information.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P259_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P260_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P260_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P260_S2	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, restricted stock and performance shares, the assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes and the warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P260_S3	The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted shares, performance shares, and the warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P260_S4	The dilutive effect of assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P260_S5	In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P261_S0	The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P261_S1	The undistributed earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the periods presented had been distributed.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P261_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P261_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P262_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share and per share data):
1168696_12_ITEM8_P263_S0	(1) No amount reported as the impact on earnings per share of Class A common stock would have been antidilutive.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P264_S0	Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P264_S1	The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P265_S0	The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P270_S3	The RealD, Inc. shares previously fell under Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to a lock-up period to which the Company was subject.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P270_S4	Such lock-up period expired in July 2011.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P271_S0	The held shares of RealD, Inc. stock are accounted for as available-for-sale equity securities and recurring fair value adjustments to these shares are recorded to "Other Non-Current Assets" with a corresponding entry to "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on a quarterly basis.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P272_S0	During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P275_S0	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P275_S1	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P275_S2	These interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and accordingly, the net gain (loss) on the swaps of $8.0 million, $(6.8) million and $(1.6) million, respectively, were reported as a component of other comprehensive loss for the years ended December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P276_S0	In addition, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value.

1168696_12_ITEM8_P277_S0	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
1168696_12_ITEM8_P278_S0	The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P279_S0	Long term obligations, excluding capital lease obligations, lease financing arrangements and other:
1168696_12_ITEM8_P280_S0	The fair value of the Amended Senior Credit Facility described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations," which consists of the New Term Loans and the Revolving Facility, is estimated based on quoted prices (Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) as of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P280_S1	The associated interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and are assumed to approximate fair value.
1168696_12_ITEM8_P280_S2	The fair values of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes and the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes are estimated based on quoted prices (Level 1 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) for these issuances as of December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010.

1168696_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 6,880 screens in 540 theatres in 38 states and the District of Columbia as of December 27, 2012 , with over 216 million attendees for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2012 ("fiscal 2012 ").
1168696_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 43 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P2_S3	We operate multi-screen theatres and, as of December 27, 2012 , had an average of 12.7 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P2_S4	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company's fiscal year ends on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) results in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	For fiscal 2012 , we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $2,824.2 million , $334.2 million and $144.8 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	In addition, we generated $346.6 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	Our business strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by distributing value to our stockholders, realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P3_S4	This strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatre assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Key elements of our business strategy include: Maximizing Stockholder Value.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 27, 2012 , we have returned approximately $3.5 billion to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends, including an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share of Class A and Class B common stock (approximately $155.5 million in the aggregate) paid on December 27, 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Pursuing Selective Growth Opportunities and Active Asset Management.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction that meets our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	We also intend to enhance our theatre operations by selectively expanding and upgrading existing properties in prime locations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	consisting of 25 theatres and 301 screens, and closing 20 underperforming theatres with 142 screens, ending the year with 540 theatres and 6,880 screens.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	We intend to continue to embrace innovative concepts to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts:
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	We believe the installation of premium screens allow us to offer our patrons all-digital large format experiences that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our IMAX footprint consisted of a total of 73 IMAX screens as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	We believe that expanding our IMAX presence will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results and to that end, we have recently agreed to install an additional ten IMAX digital projection systems, which will ultimately expand our IMAX footprint to 89 IMAX screens.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	We expect that our IMAX footprint will consist of between 80 to 85 auditoriums by the end of 2013 and we intend to install the remaining IMAX digital projection systems during 2014 and beyond.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S4	During fiscal 2012, we added our proprietary large screen format known as Regal Premium Experience ( RPX SM ) to 20 auditoriums, bringing our total to 37 RPX SM screens as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S5	We have been encouraged by the results of our RPX SM screens and expect to increase our RPX SM footprint to approximately 60 auditoriums by the end of 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S6	As of December 27, 2012 , we operated a total of 2,898 digital 3D capable projection systems (approximately 42% of our total screens).
1168696_13_ITEM1_P7_S7	We are pleased with the benefits of our premium screen formats primarily as it relates to IMAX and 3D film product and other 3D content and with the continued support of IMAX and 3D film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Second, we believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we focused on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We have already expanded our menu to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, beer and wine and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	During fiscal 2012, we offered expanded food items in 55 theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately 100 additional theatres during fiscal 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	In addition, as of December 27, 2012 , we have successfully launched six Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Third, we intend to continue our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	For example, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	As of December 27, 2012 , we had nearly seven million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S4	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs, such as selective discounting of ticket and concession prices in certain markets, summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S5	In addition, during fiscal 2012, we launched a new mobile application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S6	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P10_S7	Additionally, the application will help customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives, such as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), Open Road Films and National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM").
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	For example, on November 29, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Great Escape Theatres in which we acquired a total of 25 theatres representing 301 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of approximately $89.7 million.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	Subsequent to the conclusion of fiscal 2012, a post-closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price resulted in a $0.3 million increase in the net cash purchase price to approximately $90.0 million.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S4	The acquisition of the Great Escape Theatres circuit enhanced our presence in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S5	The transaction also included the assumption of working capital and is subject to customary post-closing adjustments.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P11_S6	See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this acquisition.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 27, 2012 and reaching over 690 million movie guests annually.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	National CineMedia primarily concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC"), and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	We believe our investment in National CineMedia will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	We also maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	We believe that Open Road Films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Open Road Films distributed a total of six films during fiscal 2012 and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	As of December 27, 2012 , our cumulative cash investment in Open Road Films totaled $20.0 million.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	In summary, we believe our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatres assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities: Industry Leader.

1168696_13_ITEM1_P18_S6	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Since our 2002 IPO, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of eight theatre circuits, consisting of 182 theatres and 2,109 screens, including the recent acquisition of Great Escape Theatres in fiscal 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have generally achieved immediate cost savings at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.

1168696_13_ITEM1_P20_S5	Our theatres have an average of 12.7 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P20_S6	We believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.

1168696_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P22_S6	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our board of directors.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% with annual attendance of approximately 1.4 billion attendees in 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and, consequently, box office revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	We expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	More recently, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering films to consumers, including cable television, in-home video and DVD, satellite and pay-per-view services such as video on demand and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its in-home video or DVD release has remained relatively stable.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P26_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P26_S4	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The domestic motion picture industry is in the process of converting from film-based media to electronic-based media, including the distribution of feature films in a digital format rather than a 35 mm film format.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	Virtually all entertainment content today can be exhibited digitally.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	Digital projection produces a consistent state-of-the-art presentation for patrons as there is no degradation of image over the exhibition period of the motion picture.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	We believe that operating a digital theatre circuit enables us to generate incremental revenue from differentiated motion picture formats such as digital 3D, IMAX and RPX SM , generate additional revenue from exhibition of specialty content offerings and provide greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which we expect will enhance our capacity utilization.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S4	Given our market presence, the overall diversity of our patron base and our high average screen per theatre count, we believe the benefits associated with digital technologies will be significant for our theatre circuit and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S5	We are pleased with the benefits and future potential of digital cinema primarily as it relates to 3D film product and other 3D content and with the continued support of 3D and IMAX film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S6	As directors and producers continue to embrace new technology in their productions, we expect new and innovative content generation to continue.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S7	To that end, during 2007, we, along with AMC and Cinemark, formed DCIP, to create a financing model and execute agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S8	During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S9	As of December 27, 2012 , our conversion to digital cinema was essentially complete as we operated 6,671 screens outfitted with digital projection systems, 2,898 of which are digital 3D capable.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P27_S10	See "Digital Cinema Implementation Partners Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this joint venture arrangement.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe a modern megaplex featuring stadium seating is preferred by patrons over a sloped-floor multiplex theatre, the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	We believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	We also believe that another evolution of theatre formats beyond the current megaplex is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	THEATRE OPERATIONS We operate the largest theatre circuit in the United States with 6,880 screens in 540 theatres in 38 states and the District of Columbia as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	We operate theatres in 43 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas, which include locations in suburban growth areas.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Edwards brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P29_S5	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	holders and retractable armrests and enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enables us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising, rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P31_S3	We stagger movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and lobby congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P31_S4	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P31_S5	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, e-gift cards and mobile ticketing.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state and the District of Columbia as of December 27, 2012 :
1168696_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	We have implemented a best practices management program across all of our theatres, including daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management reports generated for each individual theatre and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P33_S4	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers regularly inspect each theatre.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	We also operate a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre network in North America representing approximately 19,300 U.S. theatres screens (of which approximately 18,500 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 27, 2012 and reaching over 690 million movie guests annually.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	National CineMedia primarily concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), which serves as the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	In connection with the IPO of NCM, Inc., RCM, through its wholly owned subsidiary Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC ("RCH"), AMC and Cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of National CineMedia and other ancillary agreements.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	As a result of these agreements, we receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S3	Subsequent to the IPO of NCM, Inc. and through December 27, 2012 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 5.2 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S4	These transactions, partially offset by the redemption of approximately 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering during the third quarter of fiscal 2010, caused a net increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to 22.1 million common units.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S5	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.7% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P36_S6	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	We maintain an investment in DCIP, a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	During fiscal 2012, the Company effected equity contributions of approximately $7.4 million to DCIP, and expects to make additional equity contributions in the future.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	DCIP s initial financing, coupled with a second round of financing completed in March 2011 (which consisted of a new $220.0 million term loan facility), will cover the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	DCIP funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 27, 2012 , while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P37_S5	Since the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it will continue to account for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	As of December 27, 2012 , we operated 6,671 screens outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	We maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company that is jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	We believe that Open Road Films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios' big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Open Road Films distributed a total of six films during fiscal 2012 and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	As of December 27, 2012 , we have invested approximately $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and may invest an additional $10.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P40_S2	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of December 27, 2012 was approximately $(10.0) million.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P40_S3	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P40_S4	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Open Road Films.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	DISTRIBUTION Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including in-home video and DVD, cable television, broadcast television and satellite, pay-per-view services such as video on demand and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	A strong opening run at the theatre can help establish a film's success and substantiate the film's revenue potential.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S5	In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S6	In zones where there is competition, a distributor will allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P46_S7	When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Under the firm term formula, the exhibitor and distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	Lastly, under the review or settlement method, the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	These negotiations typically involve the use of historical settlements or past precedent.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	For fiscal 2012 , films shown from our ten major film distributors accounted for approximately 94% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	Five of the ten major film distributors each accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2012 admission revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P50_S3	No single film distributor accounted for more than 20% of fiscal 2012 admissions revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	From year to year, the revenues attributable to individual distributors will vary widely depending upon the number and popularity of films that each one distributes.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 26.5% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we focus on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	We have already enhanced our menu to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	During fiscal 2012, we offered expanded food items in 55 theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately 100 additional theatres during fiscal 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	In addition, as of December 27, 2012 , we have successfully launched six Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have several hundred competitors nationwide, which vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our competitors, including newly established motion picture exhibitors, may build new theatres or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	As the largest motion picture exhibitor, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S6	We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels, including home video and DVD, cable television, broadcast television and satellite, pay-per-view services such as video on demand and downloads via the Internet.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P56_S7	Other technologies could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	The theatrical release window has been stable over the past several years.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	MARKETING AND ADVERTISING Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	To market our theatres, we utilize Internet, mobile and social media, print and multimedia advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S2	In many of our markets, we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our frequent moviegoer loyalty program, Regal Crown Club , is designed to actively engage our core customers and is the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S4	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S5	Through the Regal Crown Club , we seek to enhance the customer experience and increase frequency of purchases to generate additional revenue.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S6	As of December 27, 2012 , we had nearly seven million active members in the Regal Crown Club .
1168696_13_ITEM1_P58_S7	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as selective discounting in certain markets, summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	During fiscal 2012, we launched a new mobile application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Additionally, the application will help customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Information Technology ("IT") is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our theatres, the management of our business and other revenue-generating opportunities.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery and warehouse stores and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	alternatives, such as ticketing kiosks, print-at-home ticketing, and mobile ticketing.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our Apple iPhone or Android phone application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	We continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve services to our patrons and provide information to our management, allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S3	In addition, our scheduling systems support the coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S4	The scheduling systems also provide information electronically and automatically to the media outlets, including newspapers and various online media outlets to drive attendance to our theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S5	The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as being the primary source of data for our financial systems.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P62_S6	Our revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P63_S3	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	As of December 27, 2012 , we employed approximately 22,056 persons.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

1168696_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	REGULATION The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
1168696_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P75_S3	These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
1168696_13_ITEM1_P75_S4	Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For fiscal 2012 , our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately $384.4 million and $135.0 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of December 27, 2012 , we had total debt obligations of $1,995.2 million .
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	As of December 27, 2012 , we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,083.8 million , which excludes the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of ou r 5 3 / 4 % Sen ior Notes issued on January 17, 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	For a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments" provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	As a result, inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Many of our lease agreements and the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a lease or debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other leases and debt instruments.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	performance of, or any disruption in the production of, these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with ten major film distributors accounting for approximately 94% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the ten major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce ticket prices.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We compete with other movie delivery vehicles, including cable television, downloads via the Internet, in-home video and DVD, satellite and pay-per-view services such as video on demand.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other delivery vehicles during the theatrical release window.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to three to four months over the last decade.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Further, some film studios have experimented with offering consumers a premium video-on-demand option for certain films approximately two months after their theatrical launch.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Generally, stadium seating found in modern megaplex theatres is preferred by patrons over slope-floored multiplex theatres, which were the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Although, as of December 27, 2012 , approximately 84% of our screens were located in theatres featuring stadium seating, we still serve many markets with sloped-floored multiplex theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres, and should other theatre operators choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets, the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, should other theatre operators return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken in the late 1990's, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We may not benefit from our strategic acquisition strategy and partnerships.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In the case of acquisitions, even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S8	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S9	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S10	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S11	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S13	If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to service debt incurred to finance an acquisition, our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P9_S14	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We also selectively pursue theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As of December 27, 2012 , we owned approximately 19.7% of National CineMedia, and participate in the DCIP and Open Road Films joint ventures.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, Open Road Films or other future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Economic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If economic conditions are weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Theatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	For example, our future ability to borrow on Regal Cinemas' senior credit facility or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses, power outages and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S12	Anschutz Company owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S14	As a result, as of December 27, 2012 , Anschutz Company controlled approximately 78% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S15	For as long as Anschutz Company continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S16	Anschutz Company will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to Anschutz Company but not to other stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S17	In addition, Anschutz Company and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S18	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S19	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S20	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P15_S21	Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As of February 18, 2013 , we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Anschutz Company is able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by Anschutz Company or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We are a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries, or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and are subject to various business considerations.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2018 (the "9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2025 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If our and our subsidiaries' cash flows prove inadequate to meet our and their debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our and our subsidiaries' existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing.
1168696_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1168696_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 to 20 years.
1168696_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_13_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that these facilities are adequate for our operations.
1168696_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	Pursuant to Rule 12b-23 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the information required to be furnished by us under this Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) is incorporated by reference to the information contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 18, 2013 , there were a pproximately 253 stoc kholders of record of our Class A common stock and one stockholder of record of our Class B common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	Additionally, as of February 18, 2013 , approximately 105,358 shares of our Class A common stock are issuable upon exercise of stock options that vest and are exercisable at various dates through June 23, 2014, with exercise prices ranging from $8.856 to $13.7171.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	All such options were fully vested and exercisable as of February 18, 2013 .
1168696_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	Finally, as of February 18, 2013 our officers, directors and key employees hold, or in the case of performance shares are eligible to receive, approximately 2,036,819 restricted shares of our Class A common stock, for which the restrictions lapse or the performance criteria and vesting may be satisfied, at various dates through January 9, 2017.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P1_S4	All shares underlying outstanding options and all shares of restricted stock are registered and will be freely tradable when the option is exercised, in the case of restricted stock when the restrictions lapse, unless such shares are acquired by an affiliate of Regal, in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividend Policy During fiscal 2012 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $131.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	In addition, on December 27, 2012, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $155.5 million.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	During fiscal 2011, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $129.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S3	On February 7, 2013 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S4	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2013 to our stockholders of record on March 5, 2013 .
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S5	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P2_S6	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None.
1168696_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (2) Includes the December 27, 2012 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	(3) Includes the December 30, 2010 payment of the $1.40 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S2	(4) During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we redeemed 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $14.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S3	We received approximately $66.0 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $52.0 million.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S4	(5) During the years ended December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, and January 1, 2009, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.1 million, $17.9 million, $10.3 million, $15.3 million, and $22.4 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S5	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S6	(6) During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S7	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S8	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. (1,222,780 shares) to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM6_P0_S9	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview and Basis of Presentation We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 6,880 screens in 540 theatres in 38 states and the District of Columbia as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which concentrates on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and discount ticket programs, various other activities in our theatres and theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company's revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The unexpected emergence or continuance of a "hit" film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	We evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions, which include those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S5	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S6	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P6_S7	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The Company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	We estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	The ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film's initial box office receipts.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	As a result, there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable, because we make such estimates based on each film's box office receipts through the end of the reporting period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	For the fiscal years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 , there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of 30 years.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life, and their depreciable lives (12-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S8	For example, in connection with our deployment of leased digital projection systems to theatres across our circuit, the Company accelerated depreciation of its owned 35mm film projection equipment that was replaced with leased digital projection systems, with such depreciation occurring over the expected deployment schedule since the Company disposed of such equipment prior to the end of its useful life.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S9	To that end, during the fiscal years ended December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, the Company recorded approximately $7.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation related to such 35mm film projection equipment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S10	Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S11	Historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S12	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S13	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P16_S14	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	For the fiscal years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 , no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	For the fiscal year ended December 27, 2012 , consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $183.1 million , representing 6.5% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately $11.0 million, or 6.0%.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $12.5 million, or 6.8%.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	For fiscal 2012 , our provision for income taxes was $91.2 million .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained, the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 38.7% to 39.7% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $2.5 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant Events and Fiscal 2013 Outlook During the fiscal years ended December 27, 2012 (" Fiscal 2012 Period "), December 29, 2011 (" Fiscal 2011 Period "), and December 30, 2010 (" Fiscal 2010 Period "), the Company entered into various financing transactions which are more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities" below and in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As discussed further under "Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities" below and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, during the Fiscal 2012 Period, we completed the acquisition of Great Escape Theatres in which we acquired a total of 25 theatres representing 301 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of approximately $89.7 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Subsequent to the conclusion of the Fiscal 2012 Period, a post-closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price resulted in a $0.3 million increase in the net cash purchase price to approximately $90.0 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	our presence in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	During the Fiscal 2012 Period, we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives:
1168696_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	We demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	During Fiscal 2012, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share, or approximately $131.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	In addition, on December 27, 2012, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share, or approximately $155.5 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	We continued to embrace innovative concepts to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts: We believe the installation of premium screens allows us to offer our patrons all-digital large format experiences that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our IMAX footprint consisted of a total of 73 IMAX screens as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	We believe that expanding our IMAX presence will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results and to that end, we have recently agreed to install an additional ten IMAX digital projection systems, which will ultimately expand our IMAX footprint to 89 IMAX screens.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	We expect that our IMAX footprint will consist of between 80 to 85 auditoriums by the end of 2013 and we intend to install the remaining IMAX digital projection systems during 2014 and beyond.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	During the Fiscal 2012 Period, we added our proprietary large screen format known as Regal Premium Experience ( RPX SM ) to 20 auditoriums, bringing our total to 37 RPX SM screens as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	We have been encouraged by the results of our RPX SM screens and expect to increase our RPX SM footprint to approximately 60 auditoriums by the end of 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S6	As of December 27, 2012 , we operated a total of 2,898 digital 3D capable projection systems (approximately 42% of our total screens).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S7	We are pleased with the benefits of our premium screen formats primarily as it relates to IMAX and 3D film product and other 3D content and with the continued support of IMAX and 3D film product by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P27_S8	Second, we believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we focused on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	We have already expanded our menu to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, beer and wine and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	During the Fiscal 2012 Period, we offered expanded food items in 55 theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately 100 additional theatres during fiscal 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	In addition, as of December 27, 2012 , we have successfully launched six Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	Third, we intend to continue our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	For example, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S6	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S7	As of December 27, 2012 , we had nearly seven million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S8	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs, such as selective discounting of ticket and concession prices in certain markets, summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S9	In addition, during the Fiscal 2012 Period, we launched a new mobile application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S10	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P28_S11	Additionally, the application will help customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Finally, we believe that Open Road Films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Open Road Films distributed a total of six films during the Fiscal 2012 Period and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	We are optimistic regarding the breadth of the 2013 film slate, including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium-priced formats.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Evidenced by the motion picture studios' continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases, 2013 appears to be another year of high-profile releases such as A Good Day to Die Hard, Oz The Great and Powerful, The Croods, G.I.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Joe: Retaliation, Oblivion, Iron Man 3, The Great Gatsby, Star Trek Into Darkness, Fast Furious 6, After Earth, Man of Steel, Monsters University, World War Z, The Heat, Despicable Me 2, Pacific Rim, The Wolverine, 300: Rise of an Empire, Ender's Game, Thor: The Dark World, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and Anchorman:
1168696_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	We intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	With respect to capital expenditures, subject to the timing of certain construction projects, we expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales) to be in the range of $100.0 million to $115.0 million for fiscal 2013 , consisting of new theatre development, expansion of existing theatre facilities, upgrades and replacements.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Overall for the fiscal 2013 year, we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	In addition, we expect fiscal 2013 admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P33_S4	We will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities, selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P33_S5	For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Recent Developments As discussed further in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on January 17, 2013, the Company issued and sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5 3 / 4 % senior notes due 2025 (the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes ) in a registered public offering.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	The Company issued the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes under an Indenture, dated as of January 17, 2013, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 17, 2013, with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $244.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions and the redemption, repayment or repurchase of indebtedness.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	On February 16, 2013, Regal and its wholly owned subsidiary, RGCS Merger Sub, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Wallace Theater Holdings, Inc.

1168696_13_ITEM7_P35_S4	See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this transaction.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Results of Operations Based on our review of industry sources, North American box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to the Fiscal 2012 Period were estimated to have increased by approximately six percent in comparison to the period of time that corresponds to the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The industry's box office results were positively impacted by strong attendance generated by the commercial appeal of the overall fiscal 2012 film slate, including most notably, The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and The Hunger Games.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items included in our consolidated statements of income for the Fiscal 2012 Period, the Fiscal 2011 Period and the Fiscal 2010 Period (dollars and attendance in millions, except average ticket prices and average concessions per patron):
1168696_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ * Not meaningful (1) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of admissions revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	(2) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of concessions revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	(3) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of total revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Fiscal 2012 Period Compared to Fiscal 2011 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2012 Period, total admissions revenues increased $82.5 million , or 4.5% , to $1,925.1 million , from $1,842.6 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period primarily due to a 2.3% increase in average ticket price and a 2.1% increase in attendance.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	We believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the motion picture studios.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Fiscal 2012 Period increase in attendance was primarily attributable to the commercial appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the Fiscal 2012 Period, including The Avengers , The Dark Knight Rises and The Hunger Games, as compared to the films exhibited during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the increase in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was slightly lower than the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	Concessions Total concessions revenues increased $40.4 million , or 5.7% , to $748.4 million during the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $708.0 million for the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	Average concessions revenues per patron during the Fiscal 2012 Period increased 3.6% , to $3.46 , from $3.34 for the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	The increase in total concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2012 Period was attributable to the increase in average concessions revenues per patron, coupled with the aforementioned increase in attendance during the period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S6	The increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily a result of an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume during the Fiscal 2012 Period, and to a lesser extent, the positive impact of an expanded variety of food items offered in 55 of our theatres during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S7	Other Operating Revenues During the Fiscal 2012 Period, other operating revenues increased $19.6 million , or 15.0% , to $150.7 million , from $131.1 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S8	Included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire), revenues from our vendor marketing programs and other theatre revenues, including revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P39_S9	The increase in other operating revenues during the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily driven by increases in revenues from our vendor marketing programs, increases in other theatre revenues and increases in theatre access fees, partially offset by a decline in revenue related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Film Rental and Advertising Costs Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues increased to 52.0% during the Fiscal 2012 Period from 51.8% in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The increase in film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of box office revenues during the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily attributable to higher film costs associated with the success of the top tier films exhibited during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Cost of Concessions During the Fiscal 2012 Period, cost of concessions increased $4.5 million , or 4.7% , to $101.1 million as compared to $96.6 million during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	Cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2012 Period was approximately 13.5% , compared to 13.6% during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	The decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily related to an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions during the Fiscal 2012 Period, partially offset by slightly higher raw material costs for certain items.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	Rent Expense Rent expense increased by $2.9 million , or 0.8% , to $384.4 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $381.5 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	The increase in rent expense during the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily related to incremental rent associated with the opening of eight new theatres with 107 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2011 Period, higher contingent rent associated with increased admissions and concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2012 Period, and to a lesser extent, incremental rent associated with the Fiscal 2012 Period acquisition of Great Escape Theatres, partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of 20 theatres with 142 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased $8.5 million , or 1.1% , to $735.9 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $744.4 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	The decrease in other operating expenses during the Fiscal 2012 Period was attributable to reductions in theatre level payroll and certain non-rent occupancy costs and decreased costs associated with lower 3D film revenues, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with higher IMAX film revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S9	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $3.0 million , or 4.6% , to $68.8 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $65.8 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P40_S10	The increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation expense and increased legal and professional fees and corporate payroll costs.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $14.5 million , or 7.3% , to $183.1 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $197.6 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation related to the replacement of owned 35mm film projectors with leased digital projection systems.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	Income from Operations Income from operations increased $112.9 million , or 51.0% , to $334.2 million during the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $221.3 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	The net increase in income from operations during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in total revenues, reductions in certain variable operating expense line items described above, and a lower net loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets and other.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	Interest Expense, net During the Fiscal 2012 Period, net interest expense decreased $14.7 million , or 9.8% , to $135.0 million , from $149.7 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	The decrease in net interest expense during the Fiscal 2012 Period was principally due to a lower effective interest rate on our Term Facility (including a change in our interest rate swap portfolio).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	Earnings Recognized from NCM Earnings recognized from NCM decreased $3.1 million , or 8.2% , to $34.8 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period, from $37.9 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S7	The Company received $38.5 million and $40.3 million , respectively, in cash distributions from National CineMedia (including payments received of $8.5 million and $7.0 million , respectively, under the tax receivable agreement described more fully in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) during the Fiscal 2012 Period and Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S8	Approximately $7.7 million and $7.6 million , respectively, of these cash distributions received during the Fiscal 2012 Period and the Fiscal 2011 Period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P41_S9	The remaining amounts were recognized in equity income during each of these periods and have been included as a component of Earnings recognized from NCM in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Income Taxes The provision for income taxes of $91.2 million and $17.7 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period and the Fiscal 2011 Period, respectively, reflect effective tax rates of approximately 38.7% and 30.6% , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2012 Period is primarily attributable to changes in uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities resulting from the lapse of statute of limitations and clarifications of tax law that occurred in the Fiscal 2011 Period, as well as decreases in federal hiring credits during the Fiscal 2012 Period (as described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	The effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and other income tax credits.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest Net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2012 Period was $144.8 million , which represents an increase of $104.5 million , from net income attributable to controlling interest of $40.3 million during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	The increase in net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the Fiscal 2011 Period loss on debt extinguishment associated with the Amended Senior Credit Facility, incremental income from certain of the Company's equity method investments during the Fiscal 2012 Period, lower interest expense during the Fiscal 2012 Period and the impact of the impairment of our investment in RealD, Inc. recorded in the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by lower earnings recognized from National CineMedia during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Fiscal 2011 Period Compared to Fiscal 2010 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2011 Period, total admissions revenues decreased $113.7 million, or 5.8%, to $1,842.6 million, from $1,956.3 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period primarily due to a 5.5% decrease in attendance and a 0.2% decrease in average ticket price.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	We believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the major motion picture studios.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Fiscal 2011 Period decline in attendance was primarily attributable to a decline in the appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the Fiscal 2011 Period as compared to the films exhibited during the Fiscal 2010 Period, which included the record-breaking performance of Avatar and strong attendance from other top tier releases such as Toy Story 3 , Alice in Wonderland , Iron Man 2 and Inception .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	average ticket price was a decrease in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium-priced films exhibited during the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews (which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Concessions Total concessions revenues decreased $16.3 million, or 2.3%, to $708.0 million during the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $724.3 million for the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	Average concessions revenues per patron during the Fiscal 2011 Period increased 3.4%, to $3.34, from $3.23 for the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	The decrease in total concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2011 Period was attributable to the aforementioned decrease in attendance during the period, partially offset by the increase in average concessions revenues per patron.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	The increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily a result of increases in popcorn and beverage sales volume during the Fiscal 2011 Period, selective price increases effected subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2010 Period and to a lesser extent, the impact of expanded concession menu items introduced in certain of our theatres during such periods.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	Other Operating Revenues During the Fiscal 2011 Period, other operating revenues increased $3.8 million, or 3.0%, to $131.1 million, from $127.3 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S6	Included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire), revenues from our vendor marketing programs, arcade game revenue and revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S7	The increase in other operating revenues during the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily driven by increases in National CineMedia revenues and incremental other theatre revenues, partially offset by decreases in gift card and discount ticket program revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S8	Film Rental and Advertising Costs Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues decreased to 51.8% during the Fiscal 2011 Period from 52.5% in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S9	The decrease in film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of box office revenues during the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily attributable to higher film costs associated with the success of Avatar during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S10	Cost of Concessions During the Fiscal 2011 Period, cost of concessions decreased $4.5 million, or 4.5%, to $96.6 million as compared to $101.1 million during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S11	Cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2011 Period was approximately 13.6%, compared to 14.0% during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S12	The decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily related to increases in popcorn and beverage sales volume and selective price increases effected subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S13	Rent Expense Rent expense decreased by $0.8 million, or 0.2%, to $381.5 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $382.3 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S14	The decrease in rent expense during the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily related to a reduction in our screen count subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2010 Period and slightly lower contingent rent during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S15	Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses decreased $39.6 million, or 5.1%, to $744.4 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $784.0 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S16	The decrease in other operating expenses during the Fiscal 2011 Period was attributable to savings in theatre-level payroll, other non-rent occupancy costs and a reduction in costs associated with lower premium format film revenues.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S17	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 1.3%, to $65.8 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $66.7 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S18	The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily attributable to decreases in certain corporate expenses and share-based compensation expense, partially offset by slightly higher corporate payroll costs and legal and professional fees.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S19	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $15.8 million, or 7.4%, to $197.6 million for the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $213.4 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P45_S20	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2011 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation related to the replacement of owned 35mm film projectors with leased digital projection systems.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Income from operations increased $5.5 million, or 2.5%, to $221.3 million during the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $215.8 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The net increase in income from operations during the Fiscal 2011 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily attributable to a reduction in certain variable operating expense line items described above, partially offset by a decrease in total revenues, and a greater loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets and other ($20.8 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for the Fiscal 2011 Period and Fiscal 2010 Period).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Interest Expense, net During the Fiscal 2011 Period, net interest expense increased $1.6 million, or 1.1%, to $149.7 million, from $148.1 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	The increase in net interest expense during the Fiscal 2011 Period was principally due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of the $275.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes in August 2010 and the shift in our debt portfolio resulting from the first quarter of 2011 issuance of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P46_S4	These items were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repurchases of our 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes due March 15, 2011 (the "6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes") during the second half of fiscal 2010 and first quarter of 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Earnings Recognized from NCM Earnings recognized from NCM decreased $2.9 million, or 7.1%, to $37.9 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period, from $40.8 million in the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The decrease in earnings recognized from NCM during the Fiscal 2011 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily attributable to slightly lower earnings of National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The provision for income taxes of $17.7 million and $48.7 million for the Fiscal 2011 Period and the Fiscal 2010 Period, respectively, reflect effective tax rates of approximately 30.6% and 38.7%, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	The decrease in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2011 Period is primarily attributable to changes in uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities resulting from the lapse of statute of limitations and clarifications of tax law, as well as increases in Federal hiring credits during the Fiscal 2011 Period (as described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes").
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	The effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and other income tax credits.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest Net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2011 Period was $40.3 million, which represents a decrease of $37.3 million, from net income attributable to controlling interest of $77.6 million during the Fiscal 2010 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	The decrease in net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily attributable to the impact of the $52.0 million ($31.4 million after related tax effects) gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock recorded during the Fiscal 2010 Period, incremental losses from the Company's equity investment in Open Road Films during the Fiscal 2011 Period included in "Other, net", and the impairment of our investment in RealD, Inc. recorded in the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by an increase in operating income during the Fiscal 2011 Period as described above.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Quarterly Results The Company's consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal 2012 Period include the results of operations of Great Escape Theatres, consisting of 25 theatres and 301 screens, for the period subsequent to the acquisition date of November 29, 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	The acquisition of Great Escape Theatres is further described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	The comparability of our results between quarters is impacted by the inclusion from such date of the results of operations of the Great Escape Theatres acquisition, certain other factors described below and to a lesser extent, seasonality.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly results for the eight quarters ended December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	The quarterly financial data as of each period presented below have been derived from Regal's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for those periods.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Regal and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes the December 27, 2012 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B Common Stock.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	(2) During the eight quarters ended December 27, 2012 , we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $7.4 million, $1.5 million, $2.2 million, $0.0 million, $5.2 million, $0.6 million, $5.4 million, and $6.7 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	(3) During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. (1,222,780 shares) to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources On a consolidated basis, we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes related to corporate operations, debt service and the Company's quarterly dividend payments.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the Amended Senior Credit Facility described below.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Under the terms of the Amended Senior Credit Facility and the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes issued during fiscal 2009, Regal Cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to Regal, its indirect parent.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Since Regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries, this restriction could impact Regal's ability to effect future debt or dividend payments, pay corporate expenses, repurchase or retire for cash its 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	In addition, as described further below, the Indentures under which the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes are issued limit the Company's (and its restricted subsidiaries') ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, make loans or advances to its subsidiaries, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs, rent and occupancy, and payroll.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within 30 days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the Company's concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately 30 to 35 days from purchase.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	Our current liabilities include items that will become due within 12 months.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	In addition, from time to time, we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and other financing activities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P55_S5	As a result, at any given time, our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	As further described Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company maintains an investment in National CineMedia, a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently examining National CineMedia's 2007 and 2008 income tax returns and has proposed an adjustment related to agreements entered into in conjunction with NCM Inc.'s IPO.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Management has evaluated the proposed adjustment and does not anticipate the adjustment would result in a material change to the Company's results of operations or financial position.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to this position may be necessary within the next twelve months, however the amount of such unrecognized tax benefits is not reasonably estimable as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $346.6 million , $353.1 million and $259.4 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period, the Fiscal 2011 Period and the Fiscal 2010 Period, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The $6.5 million decrease in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period increase was caused by negative fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $51.4 million, partially offset by a $44.9 million increase in net income excluding non-cash items.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	Working capital activity was primarily impacted by negative fluctuations in accounts payable activity (primarily film rental liabilities) and income taxes payable during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by the impact of increased third party sales of our gift cards and discount tickets during the latter part of 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	The negative fluctuation in accounts payable activity was primarily due to the timing of film and certain other vendor payments during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S4	The decrease in income taxes payable activity during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily associated with the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments during such periods.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S5	The $93.7 million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2011 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2010 Period increase was caused by a $62.1 million increase in net income excluding non-cash items coupled with a positive fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $31.6 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S6	In the Fiscal 2011 Period, a $23.5 million reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was the primary driver of working capital activity that negatively impacted cash flow from operating activities by $19.4 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S7	The reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the timing of real estate tax and other lease related payments and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S8	In the Fiscal 2010 Period, a $21.4 million increase in trade and other receivables and a $36.1 million reduction in accounts payable were the primary components of working capital activity that negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities by $51.0 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S9	The increase in trade and other receivables during the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily associated with increased third party sales of our gift cards and discount tickets during the latter part of 2010 and with the timing of our estimated Federal and state income tax payments.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P58_S10	The decrease in accounts payable (primarily film rental liabilities) in the Fiscal 2010 Period was primarily due to lower attendance and box office revenue at our theaters during the latter part of the period coupled with the timing of certain film payments.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres, new theatre construction, strategic partnerships, adding new screens to existing theatres, upgrading the Company's theatre facilities and replacing equipment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	We fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows, cash on hand, proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	We maintain an investment in DCIP, a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	During the Fiscal 2012 Period, the Company effected equity contributions of approximately $7.4 million to DCIP, and expects to make additional equity contributions in the future.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	DCIP s initial financing, coupled with a second round of financing completed in March 2011 (which consisted of a new $220.0 million term loan facility), has covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	DCIP funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S6	In accordance with the master equipment lease agreement (the "Master Lease"), the digital projection systems are leased from Kasima, LLC under a twelve-year term with ten one-year fair value renewal options.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S7	The Master Lease also contains a fair value purchase option.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S8	Under the Master Lease, the Company pays annual minimum rent of $1,000 per digital projection system from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term and is, upon certain conditions described below, subject to incremental annual rent of $2,000 per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S9	In the event that the junior capital raised by DCIP in the initial financing transactions remains outstanding at any time on or after the date that is six and a half years after the closing date of March 2010, the holders of the related notes will have the right to require the Company and other participating exhibitors to make incremental minimum rent payments of $2,000 per digital projection system per year through the earlier of the end of the lease term or until such notes are repaid.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S10	The Company considers both the $1,000 minimum rental and the incremental minimum rental payment of $2,000 per digital projection system to be minimum rents and accordingly has recorded such rents on a straight-line basis in its consolidated financial statements.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S11	The Company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the Master Lease.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S12	Certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P59_S13	The Company accounts for the Master Lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	$12.8 million and $7.4 million, respectively, associated with the leased digital projection systems.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	As of December 27, 2012 , we operated 6,671 screens outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	We intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects, with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non-maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the Company's internal rate of return targets.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	We currently expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales) for theatre development, expansion, upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately $100.0 million to $115.0 million in fiscal year 2013 , exclusive of acquisitions.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	On November 29, 2012, Regal completed the acquisition of Great Escape Theatres, whereby it acquired a total of 25 theatres representing 301 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of $89.7 million .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Subsequent to the conclusion of the Fiscal 2012 Period, a post-closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price resulted in a $0.3 million increase in the net cash purchase price to approximately $90.0 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	The transaction involved multiple sellers and the aggregate purchase price included repayment of the sellers' debt and the assumption of working capital.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	The acquisition of the Great Escape Theatres circuit enhanced Regal's presence in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	Please refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this transaction.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	As described more fully in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, during the Fiscal 2012 Period, we received from National CineMedia approximately 0.1 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	This transaction caused a proportionate increase in the Company's Additional Investments Tranche and increased our ownership share in National CineMedia to 22.1 million common units.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.7% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	During the Fiscal 2011 Period, we announced the creation of Open Road Films.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	We believe that Open Road Films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios' big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Open Road Films distributed a total of six films during fiscal 2012 and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	As of December 27, 2012 , we have invested approximately $20.0 million in cash contributions in Open Road Films and may invest an additional $10.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $183.4 million , $101.1 million and $82.7 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period, the Fiscal 2011 Period and the Fiscal 2010 Period, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	The $82.3 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2012 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period, was primarily attributable to the impact of the $89.7 million acquisition of Great Escape Theatres during the Fiscal 2012 Period and a $16.7 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) during the Fiscal 2012 Period, partially offset by a $29.5 million decrease in cash contributions to our various investments in non-consolidated entities during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	The $18.4 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2011 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2010 Period, was primarily attributable to the impact of net proceeds of approximately $66.0 million related to the sale of NCM, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2010 Period, a $14.2 million reduction in proceeds from the disposition of assets during the Fiscal 2011 Period and incremental cash contributions to our various investments in non-consolidated entities during the Fiscal 2011 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2010 Period, partially offset by the impact of the $55.0 million acquisition of eight AMC theatres during the Fiscal 2010 Period, an $11.2 million reduction in capital expenditures during the Fiscal 2011 Period and $2.7 million in proceeds received in connection with a property insurance claim during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Financing Activities On January 4, 2011, Regal issued and sold $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes at a price equal to 104.5% of their face value.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The notes were issued under an existing Indenture entered into by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), dated August 16, 2010, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated January 7, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	In addition, on February 10, 2011, Regal issued and sold $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes at a price equal to 104.5% of their face value.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	The notes were issued on February 15, 2011 under an existing Indenture entered into by and between the Company and the Trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, and a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated February 15, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	The notes issued in 2011 constitute additional securities under the existing Indenture and are treated as a single series with, and have the same terms as, and are fungible with, the $275.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes described herein and previously issued under the Indenture on August 16, 2010.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S5	The net proceeds from the 2011 offerings, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions by the Company, were approximately $257.8 million.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P66_S6	The Company used the net proceeds to repay approximately $234.6 million of the Amended Senior Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	below, the Company recorded an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $21.9 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	On February 23, 2011, Regal Cinemas entered into the Refinancing Agreement (the "Refinancing Agreement") with Regal, the Guarantors, Credit Suisse, and the Lenders, which amends and refinances the term facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility (the "Term Facility") described further in Note 5 to the 2010 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Pursuant to the Refinancing Agreement, Regal Cinemas consummated a permitted secured refinancing of the Term Facility in the amount of $1,006.0 million (the "New Term Loans"), and in accordance therewith, the Lenders advanced the New Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,006.0 million with a final maturity date in August 2017.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Together with other amounts provided by Regal Cinemas, proceeds of the New Term Loans were applied to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility in effect immediately prior to the making of the New Term Loans.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	In addition to extending the maturity date of the New Term Loans, the Refinancing Agreement also amends the Amended Senior Credit Facility by reducing the interest rate on the New Term Loans, by providing, at Regal Cinemas' option, either a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin that is determined according to the consolidated leverage ratio of Regal Cinemas and its subsidiaries.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	Such applicable margin will be either 2.00% or 2.25% in the case of base rate loans and either 3.00% or 3.25% in the case of LIBOR rate loans.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	The Refinancing Agreement also amends the Second Amended and Restated Guaranty and Collateral Agreement, dated May 19, 2010, to exclude Margin Stock (as defined therein) from the grant of the security interest in the Collateral (as defined therein) used to secure the obligations under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	As of December 27, 2012 , we had approximately $988.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the New Term Loans, $533.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (including premium) under the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and $393.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	As of December 27, 2012 , we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the Revolving Facility.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	As of December 27, 2012 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of certain rating agencies, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the Company's current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	An upgrade or downgrade of the Company's debt ratings, depending on the extent, could affect the cost to borrow funds.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P70_S5	There were no upgrades or downgrades to the Company's debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	During the Fiscal 2012 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $131.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	In addition, on December 27, 2012, Regal paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of its Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $155.5 million .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	On February 7, 2013 , the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 15, 2013 , to stockholders of record on March 5, 2013 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	We, at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S5	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S6	Net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $306.7 million , $204.3 million and $299.5 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period, the Fiscal 2011 Period and the Fiscal 2010 Period, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P71_S7	The net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period of $102.4 million was primarily attributable to a the impact of receiving $261.3 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes in the Fiscal 2011 Period, a $157.5 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders during the 2012 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2011 Fiscal Period, partially offset by a decrease in net payments on long-term debt obligations of $233.6 million and the impact of $74.7 million of cash used to redeem our 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Period, and lower debt acquisition costs during the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by a $212.5 million of incremental net payments on long-term debt obligations (including the Amended Senior Credit Facility described above).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	On June 27, 2012, we filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-182383-01).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	This registration statement enables us to offer to sell, from time to time, debt securities, Class A common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts or units.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The shelf registration statement will also permit our subsidiary, Regal Cinemas, to offer to sell, from time to time, debt securities, that may be guaranteed by us.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	Pursuant to the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the Commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue or guarantee securities under this registration statement.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P73_S4	See "Recent Developments" above and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K as of December 27, 2012 for information regarding securities issued under this automatic shelf registration statement subsequent to the year ended December 27, 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") was approximately $554.1 million , $405.3 million and $487.8 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period, the Fiscal 2011 Period and the Fiscal 2010 Period, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The increase in EBITDA in the Fiscal 2012 Period from the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the Fiscal 2011 Period loss on debt extinguishment associated with the Amended Senior Credit Facility, incremental income from certain of the Company's equity method investments during the Fiscal 2012 Period and the impact of the impairment of our investment in RealD, Inc. recorded in the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by lower earnings recognized from National CineMedia during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The Company uses EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, for servicing our debt, paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs, prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors for these purposes as well.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by or used in operating activities, as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), since it omits the impact of interest, taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash (such as receivables, payables and inventories) as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items (such as long-term loss accruals and deferred items).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Because EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized, which assets will often have to be replaced in the future.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Further, EBITDA, because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service, income taxes, cash dividends, capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Nonetheless, EBITDA is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that these measures are critical to the capital markets' analysis of our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	We also evaluate EBITDA because it is clear that movements in these non-GAAP measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	A reconciliation of EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows (in millions):
1168696_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	This interest rate swap agreement is designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 4.82% as of December 27, 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Under the terms of the Company s interest rate swap agreement as of December 27, 2012, Regal Cinemas receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	The 3-month LIBOR rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swap for the following three-month period.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	The interest rate swap settles any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter, until expiration.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swap will be included in interest expense.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swap, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swap represented prevailing rates for the counterparty at the time the interest rate swap was entered into.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The interest rate swap qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the Company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the 3-month LIBOR on $200.0 million of variable rate obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	The change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swap s gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the designated hedging instrument (the one effective interest rate swap) will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of the swap.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	Below is a summary of the Company s current interest rate swap agreements designated as hedge agreements as of December 27, 2012 :
1168696_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	_______________________________ (1) During the year ended December 29, 2011, Regal Cinemas entered into two hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements with effective dates beginning on June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012, respectively, and maturity terms ending on June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

1168696_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	The interest rate swaps are designated to hedge $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	(2) During the quarter ended September 27, 2012, Regal Cinemas entered into one additional hedging relationship via one distinct interest rate swap agreement with an effective date beginning on December 31, 2013 and a maturity date of December 31, 2016.

1168696_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	The interest rate swap is designated to hedge $150.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	On March 31, 2012, one of our interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge approximately $250.0 million of variable rate obligations matured.

1168696_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	On June 30, 2012, two of our additional interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge approximately $550.0 million of variable rate obligations matured.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	These swaps required Regal Cinemas to pay interest at 2.53% and 2.22% , respectively, and receive interest of a variable rate.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P88_S3	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P88_S4	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P88_S5	See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Sale-Leaseback Transactions For information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions, refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The Company has assumed long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Company does not utilize variable interest entities or any other form of off-balance sheet financing.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	As of December 27, 2012 , the Company's estimated contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next several periods are as follows (in millions):
1168696_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2012 and exclude $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes issued on January 17, 2013.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Our Amended Senior Credit Facility provides for mandatory prepayments under certain scenarios.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our long-term debt obligations and related matters.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	(2) Future interest payments on the Company's unhedged debt obligations as of December 27, 2012 (consisting of approximately $788.4 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Loans, $525.0 million outstanding under the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, $400.0 million outstanding under the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes, and approximately $9.0 million of other debt obligations) are based on the stated fixed rate or in the case of the $788.4 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Loans, the current interest rate specified in our Amended Senior Credit Facility as of December 27, 2012 (3.21%).
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	Future interest payments on the Company's hedged indebtedness as of December 27, 2012 (the remaining $200.0 million of borrowings under the New Term Loans) are based on (1) the applicable margin (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) as of December 27, 2012 (3.00%) and (2) the expected fixed interest payments under the Company's interest rate swap agreements, which are described in further detail under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	Future interest payments are calculated based on interest rates implicit in the underlying leases, which have a weighted average interest rate of 11.31%, maturing in various installments through 2021.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S4	(4) Includes estimated capital expenditures and investments to which we were committed as of December 27, 2012 , including improvements associated with existing theatres, the construction of new theatres, the estimated cost of ADA related betterments and investments in non-consolidated entities.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S5	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S6	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P93_S7	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) The table does not include approximately $7.6 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized state tax benefits because the timing of the related payments was not reasonably estimable as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	In addition, as of December 27, 2012 , Regal Cinemas had approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the $85.0 million Revolving Facility.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	Regal Cinemas also maintains a sublimit within the Revolving Facility of $10.0 million for short-term loans and $30.0 million for letters of credit.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our Revolving Facility will be adequate for the Company to execute its business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for the next 12 months.
1168696_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the operating leases detailed above in this Form 10-K, under the heading "Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments," the Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.

1168696_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Under the terms of the Company's effective interest rate swap agreement (which hedges an aggregate of $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations as of December 27, 2012 ) described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas pays interest at a fixed rate of 1.82% and receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR.
1168696_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , borrowings of $988.4 million and $998.5 million (net of debt discount), respectively, were outstanding under the New Term Loans at an effective interest rate of 3.53% (as of December 27, 2012 ) and 4.96% (as of December 29, 2011), after the impact of interest rate swaps is taken into account.
1168696_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company's effective interest rate under the New Term Loans as of December 27, 2012 , would increase or decrease interest expense by $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In addition, the Company is exposed to equity price risk associated with approximately 1.2 million shares of stock held in RealD, Inc. as described further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 27, 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	We also have audited Regal Entertainment Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	Regal Entertainment Group's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P3_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 27, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also in our opinion, Regal Entertainment Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Regal Entertainment Group (the "Company," "Regal," "we" or "us") is the parent company of Regal Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ("REH"), which is the parent company of Regal Cinemas Corporation ("Regal Cinemas") and its subsidiaries.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Regal Cinemas' subsidiaries include Regal Cinemas, Inc. ("RCI") and its subsidiaries, which include Edwards Theatres, Inc. ("Edwards") and United Artists Theatre Company ("United Artists").
1168696_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	The terms Regal or the Company, REH, Regal Cinemas, RCI, Edwards and United Artists shall be deemed to include the respective subsidiaries of such entities when used in discussions included herein regarding the current operations or assets of such entities.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Regal operates the largest theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 6,880 screens in 540 theatres in 38 states and the District of Columbia as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company formally operates on a 52-week fiscal year with each quarter generally consisting of 13 weeks, unless otherwise noted.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	The Company's fiscal year ends on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2008) results in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	During 2001 and 2002, the Anschutz Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Anschutz") acquired controlling equity interests in United Artists, Edwards and RCI upon each of the entities' emergence from bankruptcy reorganization.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	In May 2002, the Company sold 18.0 million shares of its Class A common stock in an initial public offering at a price of $19.00 per share, receiving aggregate net offering proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses, of $314.8 million .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regal and its subsidiaries.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S2	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S3	Revenue Recognition Revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit card at the point of sale.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S4	Other operating revenues consist primarily of product advertising (including vendor marketing programs) and other ancillary revenues that are recognized as income in the period earned.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S5	The Company generally recognizes payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor programs as revenue in the periods in which the advertising is displayed or when the related impressions are delivered.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S6	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S7	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S8	Proceeds received from advance ticket sales and gift cards are recorded as deferred revenue.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S9	The Company recognizes revenue associated with gift cards and advanced ticket sales at such time as the items are redeemed, or when redemption becomes unlikely.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P14_S10	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of the Company's historical redemption trends.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of 3 months or less to be cash equivalents.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	At December 27, 2012 , the Company held substantially all of its cash in temporary cash investments in the form of certificates of deposit and variable rate investment accounts with major financial institutions.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Inventories Inventories consist of concession products and theatre supplies.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company states inventories on the basis of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost, which is not in excess of net realizable value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	Property and Equipment The Company states property and equipment at cost.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P16_S3	Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P16_S4	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	$11.4 million , respectively, of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	The Company also capitalizes certain direct external costs associated with software developed for internal use after the preliminary software project stage is completed and Company management has authorized further funding for a software project and it is deemed probable of completion.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company capitalizes these external software development costs only until the point at which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P18_S3	The Company records depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1168696_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	As of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , included in property and equipment is $104.1 million of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $63.1 million and $58.2 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities described below, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, future years budgeted theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P20_S4	The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P20_S5	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	This analysis resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $11.1 million , $17.9 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms ranging generally from 15 to 20 years .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	Certain leases for Company theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P23_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	None of our lease agreements require us to return the leased property to the lessor in its original condition (allowing for normal wear and tear) or to remove leasehold improvements at our cost.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P24_S4	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P25_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P25_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S4	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S5	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P27_S6	Historically, and for the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 , these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P28_S3	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 was approximately $267.8 million and $178.8 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	As part of the Company s ongoing operations, we may close certain theatres within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the theatre or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	Additionally, we generally abandon certain assets associated with a closed theatre, primarily leasehold improvements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, goodwill associated with that business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	We evaluate whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business on the date of closure.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	Generally, on the date of closure, the closed theatre does not constitute a business because the Company retains assets and processes on that date essential to the operation of the theatre.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P35_S3	These assets and processes are significant missing elements impeding the operation of a business.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P35_S4	Accordingly, when closing individual theatres, we generally do not include goodwill in the calculation of any gain or loss on disposal of the related assets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P35_S5	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 indicated that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Intangible Assets As of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , intangible assets totaled $40.6 million and $32.5 million , respectively, before accumulated amortization of $12.8 million and $11.7 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Intangible assets are recorded at cost or fair value, in the case of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	In connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres in fiscal 2008, the Company acquired certain identifiable intangible assets, including $9.9 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 13.1 years and approximately $8.2 million related to an on-screen advertising contract which was amortized on a straight-line basis through January 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	In addition, the Company acquired certain other identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $14.4 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 35 years , in connection with its acquisition of eight theatres acquired from AMC during fiscal 2010.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S3	In addition, the Company acquired certain other identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $8.1 million related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 22 years, in connection with its acquisition of Great Escape Theatres during fiscal 2012 (as described further under Note 3 "Acquisitions").
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S4	During the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 , the Company recognized $1.1 million , $1.4 million and $3.9 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S5	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P37_S6	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 27, 2012 is projected below (in millions):
1168696_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Debt Acquisition Costs Other non-current assets include debt acquisition costs, which are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	Debt acquisition costs as of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 were $36.0 million , before accumulated amortization of $16.0 million and $12.4 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Investments The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using the equity method of accounting and has recorded the investments within "Other Non-Current Assets" in its consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Company records equity in earnings and losses of these entities accounted for following the equity method of accounting in its consolidated statements of income.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	As of December 27, 2012 , the Company holds a 19.7% interest in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia"), a 46.7% interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC and a 50% interest in Open Road Films (each as described further under Note 4 "Investments").
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	any future undistributed equity in the earnings of Open Road Films until Open Road Films' future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of excess losses incurred through December 27, 2012.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	In addition, the Company holds an investment in available-for-sale equity securities of RealD, Inc., an entity specializing in the licensing of 3D technologies.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	See Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for a discussion of fair value estimation methods and assumptions with respect to the Company's investment in RealD, Inc.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S3	The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities as of December 27, 2012 was approximately $149.9 million .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S4	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S5	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and RealD, Inc. and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S6	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S7	In order to determine whether the carrying value of investments may have experienced an "other-than-temporary" decline in value necessitating the write-down of the recorded investment, the Company considers various factors, including the period of time during which the fair value of the investment remains substantially below the recorded amounts, the investees financial condition and quality of assets, the length of time the investee has been operating, the severity and nature of losses sustained in current and prior years, a reduction or cessation in the investees dividend payments, suspension of trading in the security, qualifications in accountant's reports due to liquidity or going concern issues, investee announcement of adverse changes, downgrading of investee debt, regulatory actions, changes in reserves for product liability, loss of a principal customer, negative operating cash flows or working capital deficiencies and the recording of an impairment charge by the investee for goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S8	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S9	During the year ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S10	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately 6 months ) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S11	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. ( 1,222,780 shares) to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P40_S12	Other than as described above, there was no impairment of the Company's investments during the years ended December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011, and December 30, 2010.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S7	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P41_S8	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Interest Rate Swaps Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P46_S4	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P46_S5	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	Deferred revenue related to the fiscal 2007 sale of our equity interest in Fandango has been amortized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the six -year term of the agreement.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement will be amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	As of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , approximately $337.6 million and $343.5 million of deferred revenue related to the ESA was recorded as a component of deferred revenue and non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Deferred Rent The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Film Costs The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	Generally, less than one - third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within 2 to 3 months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P49_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Loyalty Program Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at one of the Company's theatres and earn concession or ticket awards based on the number of credits accumulated.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 , the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Advertising and Start-Up Costs The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	Start-up costs associated with a new theatre are also expensed as incurred.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock And Share-Based Compensation," we apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	Comprehensive Income Total comprehensive income for the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 was $149.5 million , $43.2 million and $75.4 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	Total comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangements and the change in fair value of available-for-sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments) during each of the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 .

1168696_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which amends SFAS No. 133, and requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information about how and why a company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	The required disclosures include the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format, information about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk, and the company's strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Statement expands the current disclosure framework in SFAS No. 133.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Company adopted SFAS No. 161 during the year ended December 30, 2010.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P59_S4	The adoption of SFAS No. 161 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	During June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) which is to be adopted as of the beginning of its first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, and interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46(R)") to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise's variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: a.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and b.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P61_S3	The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P61_S4	Additionally, an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to add an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	SFAS No. 167 amends FIN 46(R) to require enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise's involvement in a variable interest entity.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P62_S3	The enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	The adoption of SFAS No. 167 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows and results of operations.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P82_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_13_ITEM8_P82_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one -to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P82_S7	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO and receipt of proceeds in excess of our investment balance, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P82_S8	Accordingly, we will not provide for any additional losses as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	Until such time, equity in earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P84_S2	The modification extended the term of the exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") to 30 years , provided National CineMedia with a 5 -year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.0756 payment per patron which will increase by 8% every 5 years starting at the end of fiscal 2011, a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which will increase by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $1,020 for fiscal 2012) and, effective beginning in fiscal 2012, an additional fixed $525 payment per digital screen.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S6	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million , which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S7	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P85_S8	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	Under the units of revenue method, amortization for a period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the ESA modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement was created to account for changes in the number of theatre screens operated by each of the joint venture partners.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Historically, each of the joint venture partners has increased the number of screens it operates through acquisitions and newly built theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	Since the increased attendance associated with these incremental screens in turn provides for additional advertising revenues to National CineMedia, National CineMedia agreed to compensate the joint venture partners by issuing additional common membership units to the joint venture partners in consideration for their increased attendance from newly built theatres and acquisitions and overall contribution to the joint venture.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement also provides protection to National CineMedia in that the joint venture partners may be required to transfer or surrender common units to National CineMedia based on certain limited events, including declines in attendance associated with certain closed theatres and the number of screens operated.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P87_S3	As a result, each joint venture partner's equity ownership interests are proportionately adjusted to reflect the risks and rewards relative to their contributions to the joint venture.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement provides that transfers of common units are solely between the joint venture partners and National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	There are no transfers of units among the joint venture partners.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	In addition, there are no circumstances under which common units would be surrendered by the Company to National CineMedia in the event of an acquisition by one of the joint venture partners.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P88_S3	However, adjustments to the common units owned by one of the joint venture partners will result in an adjustment to the Company's equity ownership interest percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P88_S4	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P88_S5	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	If the Company elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Additional Investments Tranche at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for the Additional Investments Tranche common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a non-operating gain or loss.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 27, 2012 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 5.2 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 2-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P90_S3	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in Regal's proportionate share of tax basis in NCM Inc.'s tangible and intangible assets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	On the IPO date, NCM, Inc., the Company, AMC and Cinemark entered into a tax receivable agreement.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, NCM, Inc. will make cash payments to us, AMC and Cinemark in amounts equal to 90% of NCM, Inc.'s actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the intangible assets described above.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S3	For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax will be computed by comparing NCM, Inc.'s actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NCM, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase in NCM Inc.'s proportionate share of tax basis in NCM's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S4	The tax receivable agreement shall generally apply to NCM, Inc.'s taxable years up to and including the 30 t h anniversary date of the NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S5	Pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, the Company received payments of $8.5 million from NCM, Inc. during the year ended December 27, 2012 with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2010 and 2011 taxable years.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S8	The Company accounts for its investment in National CineMedia following the equity method of accounting and such investment is included as a component of "Other Non-Current Assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P91_S9	Below is a summary of activity with National CineMedia included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 (in millions):

1168696_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Company recorded the additional common units (Additional Investments Tranche) at fair value using the available closing stock prices of NCM, Inc. as of the dates on which the units were received.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	increases to its investment in National CineMedia (along with corresponding increases to deferred revenue) of $0.8 million , $10.4 million and $5.9 million during the years ended December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010, respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	Such deferred revenue amounts are being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA between RCI and National CineMedia following the units of revenue method as described in (4) below.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P93_S2	These transactions caused a proportionate increase in the Company's Additional Investments Tranche and increased our ownership share in National CineMedia to 22.1 million common units.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P93_S3	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.7% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	Since Consolidated Theatres maintained an existing agreement with an on-screen advertising provider, National CineMedia was not provided access to such theatre locations until expiration of the related advertising contract.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	In accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, Regal agreed to pay National CineMedia an amount that approximates the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that would have been generated by National CineMedia if it were able to sell on-screen advertising in the acquired theatre locations on an exclusive basis.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	The fair value of the screen integration payment was approximately $8.0 million and was accrued by the Company during 2008.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P94_S3	Such amount was determined by the present value of the ultimate amount estimated to be paid to National CineMedia (approximately $8.9 million ) through expiration of the on-screen advertising contract.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P94_S4	The accretion associated with this obligation was reflected in interest expense over the life of the related obligation.

("Cinemark") formed a joint venture company known as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("DCIP"), to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema in our theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	On March 10, 2010, DCIP executed definitive agreements and related financing transactions in connection with the conversion to digital projection.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P100_S5	The Company considers both the $1,000 minimum rental and the incremental minimum rental payment of $2,000 per digital projection system to be minimum rents and accordingly has recorded such rents on a straight-line basis in its consolidated financial statements.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax asset consisted of the following at (in millions):
1168696_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	At December 27, 2012 , the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $37.0 million with expiration commencing in 2018.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	The Company's net operating loss carryforwards were generated by the entities of United Artists and Edwards.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an "ownership change" of a corporation.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize the net operating losses acquired from United Artists and Edwards may be impaired as a result of the "ownership change" limitations.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	In assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P145_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P145_S2	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $16.2 million and $16.0 million as of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , respectively, as management believes it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in future tax periods.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P145_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P145_S4	During the year ended December 27, 2012 , the valuation allowance was increased by $0.4 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created during the year ended December 27, 2012 would not be realized.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P145_S5	Also during the year ended December 27, 2012 , the valuation allowance was decreased by $0.2 million primarily related to a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to utilize certain state net operating losses created in years ended before December 29, 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	Effective December 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P146_S1	A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 was as follows (in millions):
1168696_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $1.0 million and $2.0 million within the next twelve months due the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , were $7.1 million and $12.4 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P148_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 were approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P148_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P148_S3	As of December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , the Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of approximately $1.6 million and $3.6 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P148_S4	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of income for the years ended December 27, 2012 , December 29, 2011 and December 30, 2010 was $(2.0) million , $(0.8) million and $1.1 million , respectively.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries collectively file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	The Company is not subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before 2009, and with limited exceptions, is not subject to state income tax examinations for years before 2008.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P149_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	As further described in Note 4 "Investments," the Company maintains an investment in National CineMedia, a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P150_S1	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently examining National CineMedia's 2007 and 2008 income tax returns and, as of December 27, 2012 , has proposed an adjustment related to agreements entered into in conjunction with NCM Inc.'s IPO.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P150_S2	Management has evaluated the proposed adjustment and does not anticipate the adjustment would result in a material change to the Company's results of operations or financial position.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P150_S3	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to this position may be necessary within the next twelve months, however the amount of such unrecognized tax benefits is not reasonably estimable as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is presently involved in various judicial, administrative, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business operations, including but not limited to, personal injury claims, landlord-tenant disputes, employment and other contractual matters, some of which are described below.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S2	The Company s theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S3	For example, on October 9, 2012, staff at the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Board (the Regional Board ) notified counsel for United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ( UATC ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that the Regional Board is contemplating issuing a cleanup and abatement order to UATC with respect to a property in Santa Clara, California that UATC owned and then leased during the 1960s and 1970s.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S4	According to the Regional Board, the property in question has been contaminated by dry cleaning facilities that operated at the property in question from 1961 until 1996.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S5	The Regional Board is also contemplating issuing the order to the current property owner, who has been conducting site investigation and remediation activities at the site for several years.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S6	While UATC intends to vigorously defend these matters, we cannot yet predict the outcome or the magnitude of any clean-up costs.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P151_S7	We believe that we are, and were during the period in question described in this paragraph, in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	With respect to certain matters and proceedings described herein, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss to be approximately $0.1 million .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P152_S1	Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Company believes the risk of loss is more than slight.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P152_S2	Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for cases described below in which damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal issues presented.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P152_S3	However, for these cases, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the Company's operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	In situations where management believes that a loss arising from such proceedings is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no amount within the range is more probable than another.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P153_S1	As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these proceedings is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P153_S2	The amounts reserved for such proceedings totaled approximately $6.4 million (primarily landlord-tenant disputes) as of December 27, 2012 .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P153_S3	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P154_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P154_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	In prior years, private litigants and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") had filed claims against the Company alleging that a number of theatres with stadium seating violated the ADA because these theatres allegedly failed to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with lines of sight comparable to those available to other members of the general public and denied persons in wheelchairs access to the stadium portion of the theatres.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P155_S1	On June 8, 2005, Regal reached an agreement with the DOJ resolving and dismissing the private litigants' claims and all claims made by the United States under the ADA.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P155_S2	On December 9, 2010, the parties renewed the Consent Decree for another three year term.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	From time to time, the Company receives claims that the stadium seating offered by theatres allegedly violates the ADA.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P156_S1	In these instances, the Company seeks to resolve or dismiss these claims based on the terms of the DOJ settlement or under applicable ADA standards.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P156_S2	In addition, from time to time, the Company receives letters from the state officials in states where we operate theatres regarding investigation into the accessibility of theatres to persons with visual impairments or that are deaf or hard of hearing.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	On July 20, 2010, the DOJ issued Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the provision of closed captioning and descriptive audio within the theatre environment.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	Significantly, this is the first time the DOJ has stated that open captioning may not be required by the ADA.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S2	However, by so stating, the DOJ has implied that closed captioning may be required.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S3	The Company believes it provides the members of the visually and hearing impaired communities with reasonable access to the movie-going experience, and has announced its intention to deploy new digital captioning and descriptive video systems during 2013 that should meet all such potential requirements or expectations of any federal, state or individual concerns.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S4	The Company expects the capital outlay with respect to these systems to be approximately $7.4 million .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S5	Notwithstanding these efforts, the Company continues to defend claims made by private litigants that Regal has violated state law by not providing captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S6	Regardless, the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P157_S7	The Company intends to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth above, does not currently anticipate that compliance will require the Company to expend substantial funds.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	Under each of the employment contracts, the Company must indemnify each executive from and against all liabilities with respect to such executive's service as an officer, and as a director, to the extent applicable.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P158_S1	In addition, under the employment contracts, each executive is entitled to severance payments in connection with the termination by the Company of the executive without cause, the termination by the executive for good reason, or the termination of the executive, under circumstances in connection with a change in control of the Company (as defined within each employment contract).
1168696_13_ITEM8_P158_S2	Pursuant to each employment contract, the Company provides for severance payments if the Company terminates an executive's employment without cause or if an executive terminates his or her employment for good reason; provided , however , such executive must provide written notification to the Company of the existence of a condition constituting good reason within 90 days of the initial existence of such condition and the resignation must occur within two ( 2 ) years of such existence date.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P158_S3	Under these circumstances, the executive shall be entitled to receive severance payments equal to (i) the actual bonus, pro-rated to the date of termination, that executive would have received with respect to the fiscal year in which the termination occurs; (ii) two times the executive's annual base salary plus one times the executive's target bonus; and (iii) continued coverage under any medical, health and life insurance plans for a 24 -month period following the date of termination.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	executive would have received with respect to the fiscal year in which the termination occurs; and (ii)(a) in the case of Ms. Miles, two and one-half times the executive's annual base salary plus two times the executive's target bonus; and (b) in the case of Messrs. Dunn, Ownby, and Brandow, two times the executive's annual salary plus one and one-half times the executive's target bonus; and (iii) continued coverage under any medical, health and life insurance plans for a 30 -month period following the date of termination.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P159_S1	Pursuant to the employment contracts, the maximum amount of payments and benefits payable to Ms. Miles and Messrs. Dunn, Ownby and Brandow, in the aggregate, if such executives were terminated (in the event of a change of control) would be approximately $10.0 million .
1168696_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	Each employment contract contains standard provisions for non-competition and non-solicitation of the Company's employees (other than the executive's secretary or other administrative employee who worked directly for executive) that are effective during the term of the executive's employment and shall continue for a period of one year following the executive's termination of employment with the Company.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P160_S1	Each Executive is also subject to a permanent covenant to maintain confidentiality of the Company's confidential information.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P198_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P198_S2	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, restricted stock and performance shares, the assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes and the warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes prior to redemption in March 2011.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P198_S3	The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted shares, performance shares, and the warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.

1168696_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	The undistributed earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the periods presented had been distributed.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P199_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_13_ITEM8_P199_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.

1168696_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Company's fiscal year ends on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) results in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	For fiscal 2013 , we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $3,038.1 million , $339.8 million and $157.7 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P3_S2	In addition, we generated $346.9 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	Our business strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by distributing value to our stockholders, realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P3_S4	This strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatre assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Key elements of our business strategy include: Maximizing Stockholder Value.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 26, 2013 , we have returned approximately $3.7 billion to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Pursuing Selective Growth Opportunities and Active Asset Management.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction that meet our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We also intend to enhance our theatre operations by selectively expanding and upgrading existing properties in prime locations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	existing theatres and closing 11 underperforming theatres with 101 screens, ending the year with 580 theatres and 7,394 screens.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We intend to continue to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts:
1168696_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	First, we believe the installation of premium screens allows us to offer our patrons all-digital large format experiences that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	During fiscal 2013, we continued to install additional IMAX digital projection systems and RPX SM screens in select theatre locations across the U.S.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	As of December 26, 2013 , our IMAX footprint consisted of a total of 82 IMAX screens and we operated a total of 62 RPX SM screens.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	We have been encouraged by the operating results of our IMAX and RPX SM screens and to that end, we intend to install additional IMAX digital projection systems and RPX SM screens during fiscal 2014 and beyond.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P8_S4	In addition, during fiscal 2013, we began a new initiative to install luxury reclining seating at select locations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P8_S5	Based on promising initial results, we expect to offer luxury seating in approximately 20 to 25 locations by the end of fiscal 2014.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Second, we believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We have already expanded our menu to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, beer and wine and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	During fiscal 2013, we offered an expanded menu of food items in 81 theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately 75-90 additional theatres during fiscal 2014.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	In addition, as of December 26, 2013 , we have successfully launched seven Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Third, we intend to continue our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	We maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	As of December 26, 2013 , we had over nine million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry, and these members accounted for approximately $921 million of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P11_S4	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	During 2012, we launched a mobile ticketing application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	This mobile application has been downloaded approximately 1.8 million times since its launch.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	We believe the product-driven success of our IMAX screens and growing portfolio of RPX SM screens and improved customer amenities such as luxury seating, coupled with the continued rollout of our expanded concession menu and widespread availability of mobile ticketing and other marketing initiatives allow us to deliver a premium experience in a majority of our key markets.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S5	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S6	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S7	For example, on March 29, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Hollywood Theaters, whereby we acquired a total of 43 theatres with 513 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of $194.4 million .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S8	The acquisition of Hollywood Theaters enhanced the Company s presence in 16 states and 3 U.S. territories.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S9	During November of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Great Escape Theatres in which we acquired a total of 25 theatres representing 301 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of approximately $90.0 million.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S10	The acquisition of the Great Escape Theatres circuit enhanced our presence in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S11	The 814 screens from Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters accounted for 16.3 million attendees, or 7.1% of total attendance for fiscal 2013, and contributed approximately $128.6 million , or 6.2% , of fiscal 2013 total admissions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P12_S12	See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	With respect to partnership initiatives, we maintain an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM").
1168696_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing approximately 19,900 U.S. theatres screens (of which approximately 19,100 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	During 2013, approximately 710 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which National CineMedia currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC"), and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe our investment in National CineMedia generates incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	We also maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	Open Road Films was created to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	Open Road Films distributed seven films during 2013 which generated national box office revenues of approximately $148.0 million , and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S5	As of December 26, 2013 , our cumulative cash investment in Open Road Films totaled $20.0 million.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S6	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P16_S7	In summary, we believe our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatres assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities: Industry Leader.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are the largest domestic motion picture exhibitor operating 7,394 screens in 580 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our operating philosophy focuses on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S5	At the corporate level, we are able to capitalize on our size and operational expertise to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P18_S6	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of financial data analysis, detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Since our 2002 IPO, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of nine theatre circuits, consisting of 225 theatres and 2,622 screens, including the recent acquisition of Hollywood Theaters in fiscal 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have generally achieved immediate cost savings at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S4	As of December 26, 2013 , approximately 77% of our locations featured stadium seating and approximately 78% of our theatres had 10 or more screens.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S5	Our theatres have an average of 12.7 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P20_S6	We believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Dividend Policy We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	To that end, during fiscal 2013 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $132.2 million in the aggregate.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	Further, on February 13, 2014 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	The dividend is payable on March 14, 2014 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2014 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	This dividend reflects a $0.01 per share increase from the Company's last quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share declared on October 24, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P21_S5	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our board of directors.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and in turn box office revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	Consequently, we expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	However, we believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the domestic motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P23_S5	For example, even during the most recent recessionary period, attendance levels remained stable.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Through the years, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering content to consumers, including network and syndicated television, cable and satellite television services, in-home video and DVD and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its in-home video or DVD release has remained relatively stable.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	More recently, the domestic motion picture industry has largely converted from film-based media to electronic-based media, including the distribution of feature films in a digital format rather than a 35 mm film format.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	Virtually all entertainment content today can be exhibited digitally.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Digital projection produces a consistent state-of-the-art presentation for patrons as there is no degradation of image over the exhibition period of the motion picture.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	We believe that operating a digital theatre circuit provides greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which has enhanced our capacity utilization, and enables us to generate incremental revenue from differentiated motion picture formats, such as digital 3D, and the exhibition of specialty content offerings through certain industry joint venture arrangements, such as AC JV, LLC and Open Road Films.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	Finally, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of experimenting with various initiatives and concepts aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to differentiate services and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S5	We believe the benefits associated with delivering premium movie-going experiences are significant for our industry and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue from premium motion picture formats such as IMAX and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S6	Other initiatives include broadening food and beverage offerings along with food and beverage self-serve stations, in-theatre dining and bar service, the enhancement of loyalty programs and other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S7	Finally, motion picture exhibitors have begun to offer various other customer amenities including reserved seating and luxury reclining seating.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P26_S8	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	THEATRE OPERATIONS We operate the largest theatre circuit in the United States with 7,394 screens in 580 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	We operate theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas, which include locations in suburban growth areas.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P27_S5	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	plush stadium seating with cup holders and retractable armrests and enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	In addition, we have recently begun a new initiative to install luxury reclining seating at select locations in certain of our key markets.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S4	In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enables us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising, rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S5	We strategically schedule movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and box office and concession line congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S6	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P28_S7	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, e-gift cards and mobile ticketing.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons and believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	We also believe that another evolution of theatre formats beyond the current megaplex is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 26, 2013 :
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S5	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities and monitor food service.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S6	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers and various contractual service partners regularly inspect each theatre and provide recurring feedback.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S7	In addition, we consistently solicit feedback from our patrons through an on-line guest experience program whereby our guests rank and provide detailed comments and experiences for each of our theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P30_S8	Finally, we also conduct a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing approximately 19,900 U.S. theatres screens (of which approximately 19,100 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	During 2013, approximately 710 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which National CineMedia currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), which serves as the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	In connection with the IPO of NCM, Inc., RCM, through its wholly owned subsidiary Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC ("RCH"), AMC and Cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of National CineMedia and other ancillary agreements.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	As a result of these agreements, we receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	Subsequent to the IPO of NCM, Inc. and through December 26, 2013 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 10.8 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, including approximately 3.4 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia during fiscal 2013 in connection with our acquisition of Hollywood Theaters.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	These transactions, partially offset by the redemption of approximately 6.6 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in underwritten public offerings during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, caused a net increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to 25.4 million common units.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P33_S5	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 20.0% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	On December 26, 2013, National CineMedia sold its "Fathom Events" business to AC JV, LLC ( AC JV ), a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company owned, directly and indirectly, 32% by each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark and 4% by National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Fathom Events business focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to various theatre operators (including us, AMC and Cinemark) to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule and includes events such as live and pre-recorded concerts, opera and symphony, DVD product releases and marketing events, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, live sporting events and other special events.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	In consideration for the sale, National CineMedia received a total of $25 million in promissory notes from RCI, Cinemark and AMC (one-third or approximately $8.33 million from each).
1168696_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	The notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	Interest and principal payments are due annually in six equal installments commencing on the first anniversary of the closing.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P36_S3	In connection with the sale, National CineMedia entered into a transition services agreement to provide certain corporate overhead services for a fee and reimbursement for certain facilities services, creative services, technical event services, event management services and other specified costs to the new entity for a period of nine months following the closing.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Due to the related party nature of the transaction, National CineMedia formed a committee of independent directors that hired an investment banking firm who advised the committee and rendered an opinion as to the fairness of the transaction.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Since the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in AC JV, it accounts for its investment in AC JV under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	In addition, on December 26, 2013, RCI amended and restated its existing exhibitor service agreement with National CineMedia in connection with the sale by National CineMedia of its Fathom Events business.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	AMC and Cinemark also amended and restated their respective existing exhibitor service agreements with National CineMedia in connection with the sale.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	The existing exhibitor service agreements were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by National CineMedia and each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark, respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	These Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements were then assigned by National CineMedia to AC JV as part of the sale.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions, including AC JV.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	We maintain an investment in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	During fiscal 2013, the Company effected equity contributions of approximately $3.5 million to DCIP, and expects to make additional equity contributions in the future.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	DCIP s initial financing, coupled with a second round of financing completed in March 2011 (which consisted of a new $220.0 million term loan facility), substantially covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	DCIP funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 26, 2013 , while continuing to maintain a one-third voting interest along with each of AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P40_S5	Since the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in DCIP or any of its subsidiaries, it accounts for its investment in DCIP under the equity method of accounting.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	As of December 26, 2013 , we operated 7,305 screens outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	We also maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	Open Road Films was created to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Open Road Films distributed seven films during 2013 which generated national box office revenues of approximately $148.0 million , and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	As of December 26, 2013 , we have invested $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and may invest an additional $10.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of December 26, 2013 was approximately $(7.1) million .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P42_S7	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Open Road Films.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	DISTRIBUTION Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including network and syndicated television, cable and satellite television services, in-home video and DVD and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	A strong opening run at the theatre can help establish a film's success and substantiate the film's revenue potential.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	For example, the value of home video, DVD and pay cable distribution agreements frequently depends on the success of a film's theatrical release.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P48_S4	Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	In zones where there is competition, a distributor will allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Under the firm term formula, the exhibitor and distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Lastly, under the review or settlement method, the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	These negotiations typically involve the use of historical settlements or past precedent.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P52_S4	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P52_S5	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	For fiscal 2013 , films shown from our ten major film distributors accounted for approximately 94% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	Five of the ten major film distributors each accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2013 admission revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	No single film distributor accounted for more than 20% of fiscal 2013 admissions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	From year to year, the revenues attributable to individual distributors will vary widely depending upon the number and popularity of films that each one distributes.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P54_S2	In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 26.9% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P55_S3	We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we focus on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have already enhanced our menu to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	During fiscal 2013, we offered an expanded menu of food items in 81 theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately 75-90 additional theatres during fiscal 2014.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	In addition, as of December 26, 2013 , we have successfully launched seven Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	We believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	We have several hundred competitors nationwide, which vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	As the largest motion picture exhibitor, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P59_S3	We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels, including network and syndicated television, in-home video and DVD, cable/satellite and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P59_S4	Other technologies could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	The theatrical release window has been stable over the past several years.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	However, we believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P60_S4	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	MARKETING AND ADVERTISING Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	To market our theatres, we utilize Internet, mobile and social media, print and multimedia advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	In many of our markets, we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S3	Our frequent moviegoer loyalty program, Regal Crown Club , is designed to actively engage our core customers and is the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S4	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S5	Through the Regal Crown Club , we seek to enhance the customer experience and increase frequency of purchases to generate additional revenue.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S6	As of December 26, 2013 , we had over nine million active members in the Regal Crown Club , and these members accounted for approximately $921 million of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P61_S7	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	During 2012, we launched a mobile ticketing application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	This mobile application has been downloaded approximately 1.8 million times since its launch.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	Information Technology ("IT") is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our theatres, the management of our business and other revenue-generating opportunities.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery and warehouse stores and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	We continue to expand our ability to sell tickets remotely by using our Internet ticketing partner, Fandango.com, and by offering self-service alternatives, such as ticketing kiosks, print-at-home ticketing, and mobile ticketing.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our Apple iPhone or Android phone application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	We continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve services to our patrons and provide information to our management, allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S5	In addition, our scheduling systems support the coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S6	The scheduling systems also provide information electronically and automatically to the media outlets, including newspapers and various online media outlets to drive attendance to our theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S7	The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as being the primary source of data for our financial systems.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P64_S8	Our revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	As of December 26, 2013 , we employed approximately 24,201 persons.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

1168696_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	REGULATION The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
1168696_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P78_S3	These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
1168696_14_ITEM1_P78_S4	Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For fiscal 2013 , our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately $413.6 million and $141.3 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of December 26, 2013 , we had total debt obligations of $2,310.7 million .
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S4	As of December 26, 2013 , we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,440.1 million .
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S5	For a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments" provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S6	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S7	As a result, the inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S8	The agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other debt instruments.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S11	In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our and our subsidiaries' cash flows prove inadequate to meet our and their debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our and our subsidiaries' existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with ten major film distributors accounting for approximately 94% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the ten major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S7	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce our revenue.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We compete with other movie delivery vehicles, including network and syndicated television, cable and satellite television services, in-home video and DVD and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other delivery vehicles during the theatrical release window.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The average theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to approximately four months over the last decade.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Further, some film studios have experimented with offering consumers a premium video-on-demand option for certain films approximately two months after their theatrical launch.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Generally, stadium seating found in modern megaplex theatres is preferred by patrons over slope-floored multiplex theatres, which were the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Although, as of December 26, 2013 , approximately 77% o f our locations featured stadium seating , we still serve many markets with sloped-floored multiplex theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres, and should other theatre operators choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets, the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, should other theatre operators return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken in the late 1990's, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We may not benefit from our strategic acquisition strategy and partnerships.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In the case of acquisitions, even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S8	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S9	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S10	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S11	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S12	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S13	If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to service debt incurred to finance an acquisition, our results of operations and profitability would be adversely affected.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We also selectively pursue theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As of December 26, 2013 , we owned approximately 20.0% of National CineMedia, and participate in other joint ventures such as DCIP, Open Road Films and AC JV.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, Open Road Films and AC JV or other existing or future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Economic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If economic conditions are weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Theatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe storms in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	For example, our future ability to borrow on Regal Cinemas' senior credit facility or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses, power outages and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S9	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S12	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our theatres must comply with the ADA to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Anschutz Company owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, as of December 26, 2013 , Anschutz Company controlled approximately 78% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	For as long as Anschutz Company continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Anschutz Company will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to Anschutz Company but not to other stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, Anschutz Company and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As of February 17, 2014 , we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Anschutz Company is able to sell its shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by Anschutz Company or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S8	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S10	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P20_S11	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries, or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and are subject to various business considerations.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes due 2018 (the "9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2025 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2023 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 to 20 years.
1168696_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	We believe that these facilities are adequate for our operations.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 17, 2014 , there were approximately 262 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and one stockholder of record of our Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Additionally, as of February 17, 2014 , approximately 3,900 shares of our Class A common stock are issuable upon exercise of stock options that vest and are exercisable on June 23, 2014, with an exercise price of $13.7171.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	All such options were fully vested and exercisable as of February 17, 2014 .
1168696_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	Finally, as of February 17, 2014 our officers, directors and key employees hold, or in the case of performance shares are eligible to receive, approximately 1,747,077 restricted shares of our Class A common stock, for which the restrictions lapse or the performance criteria and vesting may be satisfied, at various dates through January 8, 2018.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	shares are acquired by an affiliate of Regal, in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividend Policy During fiscal 2013 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $132.2 million in the aggregate.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	During fiscal 2012, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $131.8 million in the aggregate.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S2	In addition, on December 27, 2012, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $155.5 million.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S3	On February 13, 2014 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S4	The dividend is payable on March 14, 2014 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2014 .
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S5	This dividend reflects a $0.01 per share increase from the Company's last quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share declared on October 24, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S6	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S7	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S8	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P3_S9	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None.
1168696_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) Includes the December 27, 2012 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	(2) Includes the December 30, 2010 payment of the $1.40 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P0_S2	(3) During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we redeemed 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $14.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P0_S3	We received approximately $66.0 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $52.0 million.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P0_S4	During the quarter ended September 26, 2013, we redeemed 2.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which the Company sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $17.79 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by approximately $10.0 million , the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P0_S5	The Company received approximately $40.9 million in proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $30.9 million .
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	accounted for these transactions as a proportionate decrease in the Company's Initial Investment Tranche and Additional Investments Tranche and decreased our ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	(4) During the years ended December 26, 2013, December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011, December 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $9.5 million, $11.1 million, $17.9 million, $10.3 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S2	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S3	(5) During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S4	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S5	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S6	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S7	(6) During the quarter ended December 26, 2013, the Company identified errors related to an understatement of deferred revenue attributable to its paper gift certificate and discount ticket products and an overstatement of other operating revenue associated with the unredeemed portion of these products dating from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2012.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S8	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , we evaluated the materiality of the errors from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, and concluded that the errors were immaterial to the Company s prior period interim and annual consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S9	Since these revisions were not material to any prior period interim or annual consolidated financial statements, no amendments to previously filed interim or annual periodic reports are required.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S10	Consequently, the Company has adjusted for these errors by revising its historical selected financial data presented herein.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S11	The Company recognized the cumulative effect of the error on periods prior to those that are presented herein by increasing deferred revenue by approximately $44.2 million , reducing additional paid-in capital and retained earnings by $36.2 million and $1.8 million , respectively, and increasing goodwill by $6.2 million as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009.
1168696_14_ITEM6_P1_S12	See "Immaterial Correction of an Error in Prior Periods" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview and Basis of Presentation We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 7,394 screens in 580 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which concentrates on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and discount ticket programs, various other activities in our theatres and our relationship with National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to maximize our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company's revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	The emergence or continuance of a "hit" film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	We evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions, which include those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, deferred revenue pertaining to gift card and discount ticket sales, income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S6	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P5_S7	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	The Company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	We estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film's initial box office receipts.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result, there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable, because we make such estimates based on each film's box office receipts through the end of the reporting period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	For the fiscal years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of 30 years.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life, and their depreciable lives (12-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolete, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S8	Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S9	Historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S10	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S11	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P13_S12	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	For the fiscal years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	For the fiscal year ended December 26, 2013 , consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $200.2 million , representing 6.6% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately $12.8 million, or 6.4%.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $14.7 million, or 7.3%.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P17_S8	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	For fiscal 2013 , our provision for income taxes was $107.0 million .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained, the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 40.4% to 41.4% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $2.5 million.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	As noted in our significant accounting policies for "Revenue Recognition" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to cash received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company recognizes revenue as a component of "Other operating revenues" associated with discount tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience, when the likelihood of redemption is remote, and when there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card and discount ticket items to the relevant jurisdiction.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of historical redemption trends and considers various factors including the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant Events and Fiscal 2014 Outlook During the fiscal years ended December 26, 2013 (" Fiscal 2013 Period "), December 27, 2012 (" Fiscal 2012 Period "), and December 29, 2011 (" Fiscal 2011 Period "), the Company entered into various investing and financing transactions which are more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During the Fiscal 2013 Period, we continued to make progress with respect to our business strategy as follows:
1168696_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	During Fiscal 2013, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share, or approximately $132.2 million in the aggregate.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	In addition to the November 2012 acquisition of Great Escape Theatres, consisting of 25 theatres and 301 screens, we continued to actively manage our asset base during the Fiscal 2013 Period by completing the acquisition of Hollywood Theaters on March 29, 2013 whereby we acquired a total of 43 theatres with 513 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of approximately $194.4 million.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The acquisition of Hollywood Theaters enhanced our presence in 16 states and 3 U.S. territories.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	The 814 screens from Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters accounted for 16.3 million attendees, or 7.1% of total attendance for the Fiscal 2013 Period, and contributed approximately $128.6 million , or 6.2% , of the Fiscal 2013 Period total admissions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	In addition, we opened eight new theatres with 98 screens, opened four new screens at two existing theatres and closed 11 underperforming theatres with 101 screens, ending the Fiscal 2013 Period with 580 theatres and 7,394 screens.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	We continued to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts:
1168696_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	First, we believe the installation of premium screens allows us to offer our patrons all-digital large format experiences that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	During fiscal 2013, we continued to install additional IMAX digital projection systems and RPX SM screens in select theatre locations across the U.S.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	As of December 26, 2013 , our IMAX footprint consisted of a total of 82 IMAX screens and we operated a total of 62 RPX SM screens.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	We have been encouraged by the operating results of our IMAX and RPX SM screens and to that end, we intend to install additional IMAX digital projection systems and RPX SM screens during fiscal 2014 and beyond.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	In addition, during fiscal 2013, we began a new initiative to install luxury reclining seating at select locations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	Based on promising initial results, we expect to offer luxury seating in approximately 20 to 25 locations by the end of fiscal 2014.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Second, we believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We have already expanded our menu to include hot made-to-order meals, customizable coffee, beer and wine and other specialty products in select theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	During fiscal 2013, we offered an expanded menu of food items in 81 theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately 75-90 additional theatres during fiscal 2014.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	In addition, as of December 26, 2013 , we have successfully launched seven Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	Third, we intend to continue our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	We maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S6	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S7	As of December 26, 2013 , we had over nine million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry, and these members accounted for approximately $921 million of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P30_S8	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	During 2012, we launched a mobile ticketing application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	This mobile application has been downloaded approximately 1.8 million times since its launch.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Finally, we believe Open Road Films fills a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner and will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	Open Road Films distributed seven films during 2013 which generated national box office revenues of approximately $148.0 million , and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	As of December 26, 2013 , our cumulative cash investment in Open Road Films totaled $20.0 million.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	We are optimistic regarding the breadth of the 2014 film slate, including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium-priced formats.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	Evidenced by the motion picture studios' continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases, 2014 appears to be another year of high-profile releases such as 300: Rise of an Empire, Mr. Peabody Sherman, Divergent, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Rio 2, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Godzilla, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Maleficent, 22 Jump Street, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Dawn of Planet of the Apes, Guardians of the Galaxy, Interstellar, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1, The Hobbit:
1168696_14_ITEM7_P33_S5	There And Back Again and Night at the Museum 3.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	We intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	With respect to capital expenditures, subject to the timing of certain construction projects, we expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales) to be in the range of $115.0 million to $125.0 million for fiscal 2014 , consisting of new theatre development, expansion of existing theatre facilities, upgrades and replacements.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	Overall for the fiscal 2014 year, we expect to benefit from the impact of a 53-week fiscal year and modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	In addition, we expect fiscal 2014 admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S4	We will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities, selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S5	For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Recent Developments On February 13, 2014 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S6	The dividend is payable on March 14, 2014 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2014 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P34_S7	This dividend reflects a $0.01 per share increase from the Company's last quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share declared on October 24, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Results of Operations Based on our review of industry sources, North American box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to the Fiscal 2013 Period were estimated to have increased by approximately one to two percent in comparison to the period of time that corresponds to the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	The industry's box office results for 2013 were positively impacted by strong attendance from the breadth and commercial success of the overall film slate during 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	During the quarter ended December 26, 2013, the Company identified errors related to an understatement of deferred revenue attributable to its paper gift certificate and discount ticket products and an overstatement of other operating revenue associated with the unredeemed portion of these products dating from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2012.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , we evaluated the materiality of the errors from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, and concluded that the errors were immaterial to the Company s prior period interim and annual consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Since these revisions were not material to any prior period interim or annual consolidated financial statements, no amendments to previously filed interim or annual periodic reports are required.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	Consequently, the Company has adjusted for these errors by revising its historical consolidated financial information presented herein.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P36_S4	See "Immaterial Correction of an Error in Prior Periods" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ * Not meaningful (1) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of admissions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	(2) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of concessions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	(3) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of total revenues.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	On a comparable screen basis, the 2.2% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $42.1 million of admissions revenues), partially offset by the 1.7% decrease in attendance (approximately $32.7 million of admissions revenues), led to the increase in the Fiscal 2013 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	The comparable screen average ticket price increase was due to selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews (which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions).
1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	The decrease in comparable screen attendance during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to difficult comparisons with the strong attendance experienced in the Fiscal 2012 Period from such pictures as The Avengers , The Dark Knight Rises and The Hunger Games , partially offset by the the breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the increase in our admissions revenues on a comparable screen basis was in line with the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period Concessions Total concessions revenues increased $68.5 million , or 9.2% , to $816.9 million during the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $748.4 million for the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S7	On a comparable screen basis, total concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2013 Period was $757.6 million , an increase of $10.8 million or 1.4% from the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S8	On a comparable screen basis, the increase in total concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to a 3.2% increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $23.5 million of concessions revenues), partially offset by the aforementioned 1.7% decrease in comparable screen attendance (approximately $12.7 million of concessions revenues) during the period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S9	The increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily a result of an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume and to a lesser extent, selective price increases and the continued rollout of our expanded food menu during the period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P40_S10	Other Operating Revenues D uring the Fiscal 2013 Period, other operating revenues increased $15.1 million , or 10.3% , to $161.6 million , from $146.5 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	The increase in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily related to slightly higher raw material and packaged good costs, partially offset by an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	Rent Expense Rent expense increased by $29.2 million , or 7.6% , to $413.6 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $384.4 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	The increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to transaction costs associated with our recent acquisitions (approximately $3.2 million) and higher corporate payroll costs during the period, partially offset by slightly lower share-based compensation expense.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P42_S7	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17.1 million , or 9.3% , to $200.2 million for the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $183.1 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P42_S8	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with the addition of the 814 screens from Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P42_S13	The increase in net interest expense during the Fiscal 2013 Period was principally due to incremental interest associated with the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and the capital lease and lease financing obligations assumed from Hollywood Theaters, partially offset by interest savings associated with the partial refinance of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes with the proceeds from the second quarter of 2013 issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and a lower effective interest rate on our Term Facility (including a change in our interest rate swap portfolio).

1168696_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2013 Period is primarily attributable to changes in uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities resulting from the lapse of statute of limitations that occurred in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	The effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and other income tax credits.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest Net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2013 Period was $157.7 million , which represents an increase of $15.4 million , from net income attributable to controlling interest of $142.3 million during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock recorded during the third quarter of the Fiscal 2013 Period and higher equity earnings generated by certain of our equity method investments, partially offset by the impact of the $30.3 million ($19.2 million after related tax effects) loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Fiscal 2012 Period Compared to Fiscal 2011 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2012 Period, total admissions revenues increased $82.5 million, or 4.5%, to $1,925.1 million, from $1,842.6 million in the Fiscal 2011 Period primarily due to a 2.3% increase in average ticket price (approximately $43.8 million of total admissions revenues) and a 2.1% increase in attendance (approximately $38.7 million of total admissions revenues).
1168696_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	The primary driver of the increase in our Fiscal 2012 Period average ticket price was selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	We believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the motion picture studios.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Fiscal 2012 Period increase in attendance was primarily attributable to the commercial appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the Fiscal 2012 Period, including The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and The Hunger Games, as compared to the films exhibited during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the increase in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was slightly lower than the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	The increase in total concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2012 Period was attributable to the increase in average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $25.5 million of total concessions revenues), coupled with the aforementioned increase in attendance during the period (approximately $14.9 million of total concessions revenues).
1168696_14_ITEM7_P47_S6	The increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily a result of an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume during the Fiscal 2012 Period, and to a lesser extent, the positive impact of an expanded variety of food items offered in 55 of our theatres during the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within 30 days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the Company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately 30 to 35 days from purchase.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The $0.3 million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period increase was caused by positive fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $66.8 million, partially offset by a $66.5 million decrease in net income excluding non-cash items.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Working capital activity was primarily impacted by changes in accrued expense and other activity, accounts payable activity (primarily film rental liabilities) and income taxes payable during the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	The change in accrued expense and other activity and accounts payable activity was primarily due to the timing of film and certain other vendor payments associated with increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2013 Period.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P60_S8	The decrease in income taxes payable activity during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily associated with the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments during such periods.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	Among other things, the Second Amendment also amends the Credit Agreement (i) by deleting the interest coverage ratio test and providing that the remaining financial covenants will only be tested if the outstanding amount of the revolving loans and letters of credit (including unreimbursed drawings) under the Revolving Facility equals or exceeds 25% of the Revolving Commitment, (ii) by providing for a 1% prepayment premium applicable in the event that Regal Cinemas enters into a refinancing or amendment of the Term Facility on or prior to the first anniversary of the Second Amendment Date that, in either case, has the effect of reducing the interest rate on the Term Facility, (iii) to permit the release of Regal from its guarantee of the obligations under the Credit Agreement in the event that it does not guarantee any other debt of Regal Cinemas or its subsidiaries, and (iv) by eliminating the mortgage requirement for fee-owned real properties that are acquired by Regal Cinemas or its subsidiaries after the Second Amendment Date.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	Except as amended by the Second Amendment, the remaining terms of the Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S5	As a result of the Second Amendment, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $0.4 million during the year ended December 26, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S6	In addition, on May 28, 2013, Regal Cinemas, Regal, REH and the other affiliates of Regal Cinemas party thereto, as guarantors, entered into the Loan Modification Agreement with Credit Suisse and the revolving lenders party thereto.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S7	The Loan Modification Agreement amends the Credit Agreement by reducing the interest rate on the Revolving Facility by 1.00%.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S8	Specifically, the Loan Modification Agreement provides that, depending on the consolidated leverage ratio of Regal Cinemas and its subsidiaries, the applicable margin under the Revolving Facility for base rate loans will be either 1.50% or 1.75% and the applicable margin under the Revolving Facility for LIBOR rate loans will be either 2.50% or 2.75%.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P70_S9	The Loan Modification Agreement also amends the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from May 19, 2015 to May 19, 2017.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	As described more fully in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on June 13, 2013, the Company issued the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 in a registered public offering.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $244.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	In connection with the issuance of the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023, on May 29, 2013, the Company commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash its 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Total offer consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes tendered was $1,143.75, including an early tender premium payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes for those holders who properly tendered their 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes on or before June 11, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	Upon consummation of the tender offer, approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes were purchased.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	Total additional consideration paid in the tender offer, including the early tender premium payment, was approximately $30.7 million.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	The tender offer was financed with $244.3 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S5	As a result of the tender offer, the Company recorded a $30.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 26, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S6	As of December 26, 2013 , we had approximately $978.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Facility, $315.4 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (including premium) under the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, $394.6 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S7	As of December 26, 2013 , we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the Revolving Facility.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P72_S8	As of December 26, 2013 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of certain rating agencies, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the Company's current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	An upgrade or downgrade of the Company's debt ratings, depending on the extent, could affect the cost to borrow funds.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P73_S5	There were no upgrades or downgrades to the Company's debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	On October 23, 2013, Regal Cinemas entered into one additional hedging relationship via one distinct interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of June 30, 2015 and a maturity date of June 30, 2018.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	This swap will require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at a fixed rate of 1.828% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	The interest rate swap is designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	During the Fiscal 2013 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $132.2 million in the aggregate.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	On February 13, 2014 , the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 14, 2014 , to stockholders of record on March 4, 2014 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	This dividend reflects a $0.01 per share increase from the Company's last quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share declared on October 24, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	We, at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P75_S5	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were approximately $83.2 million , $(306.7) million and $(204.3) million for the Fiscal 2013 Period, the Fiscal 2012 Period and the Fiscal 2011 Period, respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	The net increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period of $389.9 million was primarily attributable to the impact of receiving $250.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, receiving $250.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 in the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $155.1 million decrease in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2013 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2012 Fiscal Period, partially offset by the impact of $244.3 million of cash used to repurchase a portion of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, $13.5 million of cash paid for debt acquisition costs during the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $3.1 million increase in net payments on long-term debt obligations during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	The net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2012 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2011 Period of $102.4 million was primarily attributable to the impact of receiving $261.3 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes in the Fiscal 2011 Period and a $157.5 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2012 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2011 Fiscal Period, partially offset by a decrease in net payments on long-term debt obligations of $233.6 million and the impact of $74.7 million of cash used to redeem our 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2011 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") was approximately $606.2 million , $549.9 million and $399.5 million for the Fiscal 2013 Period, the Fiscal 2012 Period and the Fiscal 2011 Period, respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increase in EBITDA for the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock and higher equity earnings generated by certain of our equity method investments, partially offset by the impact of the $30.3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	The increase in EBITDA in the Fiscal 2012 Period from the Fiscal 2011 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the Fiscal 2011 Period loss on debt extinguishment associated with the Amended Senior Credit Facility, incremental income from certain of the Company's equity method investments during the Fiscal 2012 Period and the impact of the impairment of our investment in RealD, Inc. recorded in the Fiscal 2011 Period, partially offset by lower earnings recognized from National CineMedia during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company uses EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, for servicing our debt, paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs, prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors for these purposes as well.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by or used in operating activities, as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), since it omits the impact of interest, taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash (such as receivables, payables and inventories) as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items (such as long-term loss accruals and deferred items).
1168696_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	amortized, which assets will often have to be replaced in the future.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	Further, EBITDA, because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service, income taxes, cash dividends, capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	Nonetheless, EBITDA is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs, respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P80_S3	We also evaluate EBITDA because it is clear that movements in these non-GAAP measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	A reconciliation of EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Interest Rate Swaps As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as of December 26, 2013, the Company maintained two effective hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements (maturing June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively), which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.325% to 1.820% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated to hedge $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 4.16% as of December 26, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Under the terms of the Company s two effective interest rate swap agreements as of December 26, 2013 detailed below, Regal Cinemas currently receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR on the first $300.0 million of aggregate borrowings under the Term Facility and will receive 1-month LIBOR on the next $350.0 million under the Term Facility when the remaining two swap agreements become effective.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	With respect to the Company's two effective interest rate swap agreements as of December 26, 2013, the 3-month LIBOR rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three-month period.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P83_S5	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for the counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P84_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P84_S4	Below is a summary of the Company s current interest rate swap agreements designated as hedge agreements as of December 26, 2013 :
1168696_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	______________________________ (1) During the year ended December 29, 2011, Regal Cinemas entered into two hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements with effective dates beginning on June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012, respectively, and maturity terms ending on June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

1168696_14_ITEM7_P85_S8	The interest rate swap is designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P85_S9	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P85_S10	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P85_S11	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P85_S12	See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.

Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The Company has assumed long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Other than the operating leases that are detailed below, the Company does not utilize variable interest entities or any other form of off-balance sheet financing.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	As of December 26, 2013 , the Company's estimated contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next several periods are as follows (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Our Credit Agreement provides for mandatory prepayments under certain scenarios.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our long-term debt obligations and related matters.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	(2) Future interest payments on the Company's unhedged debt obligations as of December 26, 2013 (consisting of approximately $678.3 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the Term Facility, $315.4 million outstanding under the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, $400.0 million outstanding under the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and approximately $15.4 million of other debt obligations) are based on the stated fixed rate or in the case of the $678.3 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the Term Facility, the current interest rate specified in our Credit Agreement as of December 26, 2013 (2.75%).
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	Future interest payments on the Company's hedged indebtedness as of December 26, 2013 (the remaining $300.0 million of borrowings under the Term Facility) are based on (1) the applicable margin (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) as of December 26, 2013 (2.50%) and (2) the expected fixed interest payments under the Company's interest rate swap agreements, which are described in further detail under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	Future interest payments are calculated based on interest rates implicit in the underlying leases, which have a weighted average interest rate of 11.07% , maturing in various installments through 2028.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	(4) Includes estimated capital expenditures and investments to which we were committed as of December 26, 2013 , including improvements associated with existing theatres, the construction of new theatres, the estimated cost of ADA related betterments and investments in non-consolidated entities.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S5	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S6	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S7	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S8	Our operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) The table does not include approximately $7.3 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized state tax benefits because the timing of the related payments was not reasonably estimable as of December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S9	In addition, as of December 26, 2013 , Regal Cinemas had approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the $85.0 million Revolving Facility.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S10	Regal Cinemas also maintains a sublimit within the Revolving Facility of $10.0 million for short-term loans and $30.0 million for letters of credit.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P89_S11	We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our Revolving Facility will be adequate for the Company to execute its business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for the next 12 months.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the operating leases detailed above in this Form 10-K, under the heading "Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments," the Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.
1168696_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our operations, please refer to the information provided under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
1168696_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Under the terms of the Company's two effective interest rate swap agreements (which hedge an aggregate of $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations as of December 26, 2013 ) described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas pays interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.325% to 1.820% and receives interest at a variable rate.
1168696_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	As of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , borrowings of $978.3 million and $988.4 million (net of debt discount), respectively, were outstanding under the Term Facility at an effective interest rate of 3.18% (as of December 26, 2013 ) and 3.53% (as of December 27, 2012), after the impact of interest rate swaps is taken into account.
1168696_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company's effective interest rate under the Term Facility as of December 26, 2013 , would increase or decrease interest expense by $3.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2013 .
1168696_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In addition, the Company is exposed to equity price risk associated with approximately 0.8 million shares of stock held in RealD, Inc. as described further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Such shares of stock are accounted for as available for sale securities with recurring fair value adjustments recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss/income (net of related tax effects).
1168696_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	We also have audited Regal Entertainment Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Regal Entertainment Group's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1168696_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P4_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P4_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also in our opinion, Regal Entertainment Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company generally recognizes payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor programs as revenue in the periods in which the advertising is displayed or when the related impressions are delivered.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P19_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P19_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company states property and equipment at cost.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	During the years ended December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , the Company capitalized approximately $22.4 million and $16.4 million , respectively, of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company also capitalizes certain direct external costs associated with software developed for internal use after the preliminary software project stage is completed and Company management has authorized further funding for a software project and it is deemed probable of completion.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company capitalizes these external software development costs only until the point at which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company records depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1168696_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	As of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , included in property and equipment is $171.0 million and $104.1 million of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $73.7 million and $63.1 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets (including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities as described further below) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company considers historical theatre level cash flows, estimated future theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, intangible asset carrying values, the age of the theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, strategic initiatives, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of whether or not a triggering event has occurred that indicates impairment of individual theatre assets may be necessary.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	For theatres where a triggering event is identified, impairment is measured based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Significant judgment is involved in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, estimating future cash flows and determining fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Triggering events identified resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $9.5 million , $11.1 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Certain leases for Company theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	None of our lease agreements require us to return the leased property to the lessor in its original condition (allowing for normal wear and tear) or to remove leasehold improvements at our cost.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P36_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P36_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P39_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 was approximately $320.4 million and $274.0 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	As part of the Company s ongoing operations, we may close certain theatres within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the theatre or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Additionally, we generally abandon certain assets associated with a closed theatre, primarily leasehold improvements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, goodwill associated with that business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	We evaluate whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business on the date of closure.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P48_S2	Generally, on the date of closure, the closed theatre does not constitute a business because the Company retains assets and processes on that date essential to the operation of the theatre.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P48_S3	These assets and processes are significant missing elements impeding the operation of a business.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P48_S4	Accordingly, when closing individual theatres, we generally do not include goodwill in the calculation of any gain or loss on disposal of the related assets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 indicated that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	As of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , intangible assets totaled $67.1 million and $32.5 million , respectively, before accumulated amortization of $9.4 million and $4.7 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	In connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres in fiscal 2008, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $9.9 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 13.1 years .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	During fiscal 2010, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $14.4 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 35 years , in connection with its acquisition of eight theatres acquired from AMC.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P51_S3	During fiscal 2012, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $8.1 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 22 years, in connection with its acquisition of Great Escape Theatres (as described further under Note 3 "Acquisitions").
1168696_14_ITEM8_P51_S4	Finally, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $34.4 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 18 years, in connection with its acquisition of Hollywood Theaters during fiscal 2013 (see Note 3 "Acquisitions").
1168696_14_ITEM8_P51_S5	During the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , the Company recognized $3.3 million , $1.1 million and $1.4 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 26, 2013 is projected below (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	During the year ended December 26, 2013 , the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million pertaining to certain favorable leases associated with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Other non-current assets include debt acquisition costs, which are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Debt acquisition costs as of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 were approximately $45.3 million and $36.0 million , before accumulated amortization of $19.2 million and $16.0 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting and has recorded the investments within "Other Non-Current Assets" in its consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company records equity in earnings and losses of these entities in its consolidated statements of income.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	As of December 26, 2013 , the Company holds a 20.0% interest in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia"), a 46.7% interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, a 50% interest in Open Road Films and a 32% interest in AC JV, LLC (each as described further under Note 4 "Investments").
1168696_14_ITEM8_P55_S3	In addition, the Company holds an investment in available-for-sale equity securities of RealD, Inc., an entity specializing in the licensing of 3D technologies.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P55_S4	See Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for a discussion of fair value estimation methods and assumptions with respect to the Company's investment in RealD, Inc.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P55_S5	The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities as of December 26, 2013 was approximately $266.7 million .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and RealD, Inc. and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	In order to determine whether the carrying value of investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value necessitating the write-down of the recorded investment, the Company considers various factors, including the period of time during which the fair value of the investment remains substantially below the recorded amounts, the investees financial condition and quality of assets, the length of time the investee has been operating, the severity and nature of losses sustained in current and prior years, a reduction or cessation in the investees dividend payments, suspension of trading in the security, qualifications in accountant's reports due to liquidity or going concern issues, investee announcement of adverse changes, downgrading of investee debt, regulatory actions, changes in reserves for product liability, loss of a principal customer, negative operating cash flows or working capital deficiencies and the recording of an impairment charge by the investee for goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P56_S4	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	During the year ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Other than as described above, there was no impairment of the Company's investments during the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P60_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	Our interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P65_S3	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P65_S4	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P65_S5	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Deferred revenue relates primarily to the amount we received for agreeing to the existing National CineMedia exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") modification and amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement described in Note 4 "Investments," cash received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards, amounts received in connection with vendor marketing programs, and the amount we received related to the sale of our equity interest in Fandango.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement will be amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	As of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , approximately $432.2 million and $344.3 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the ESA was recorded as a component of deferred revenue and non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	Generally, less than one - third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within 2 to 3 months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at the Company's theatres and earn concession or ticket awards based on the number of credits accumulated.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	Start-up costs associated with a new theatre are also expensed as incurred.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock And Share-Based Compensation," we apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P75_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	As of December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , the Company managed its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	Total comprehensive income for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 was $159.5 million , $147.0 million and $39.7 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangement, the change in fair value of available for sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments), the reclassification adjustment for gain on sale of available for sale securities recognized in net income and the change in fair value of equity method investee interest rate swap transactions during each of the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Immaterial Correction of an Error in Prior Periods The Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to cash received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company recognizes revenue associated with discount tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of historical redemption trends.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	During the quarter ended December 26, 2013, the Company identified errors related to an understatement of deferred revenue attributable to its paper gift certificate and discount ticket products and an overstatement of other operating revenue associated with the unredeemed portion of these products dating from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2012.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , we evaluated the materiality of the errors from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, and concluded that the errors were immaterial to the Company s prior period interim and annual consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	Since these revisions were not material to any prior period interim or annual consolidated financial statements, no amendments to previously filed interim or annual periodic reports are required.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P82_S3	Consequently, the Company has adjusted for these errors by revising its historical consolidated financial statements presented herein.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P82_S4	The Company recognized the cumulative effect of the error on periods prior to those that are presented herein by increasing deferred revenue by approximately $44.2 million , reducing additional paid-in capital and retained earnings by $36.2 million and $1.8 million , respectively, and increasing goodwill by $6.2 million as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P82_S5	The following table presents the effects of the immaterial error correction on the consolidated balance sheet for the period indicated (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The following tables present the effects of the immaterial error correction on the consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated (in millions, except per share amounts):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Impacted financial statement line items appearing in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of deficit have also been revised accordingly.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the above periods were not impacted by this immaterial correction of an error.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	However, net income was revised as shown above with an offset to the trade and other receivables and deferred revenue captions within operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820) Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	This Update clarifies the wording and disclosures required in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, to converge with those used in International Financial Reporting Standards.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	The update explains how to measure and disclose fair value under ASC 820.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P85_S3	However, the FASB does not expect the changes in this update to alter the current application of the requirements in ASC 820.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	Under ASU 2011-5, the Company is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	ASU 2011-5 became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 and has been applied retrospectively herein.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-8, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment , to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	ASU 2011-8 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P89_S2	If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P89_S3	Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	ASU 2011-8 became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2012.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011-05 .

1168696_14_ITEM8_P91_S2	This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and is to be applied retrospectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P91_S3	ASU 2011-12 became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 and has been applied retrospectively.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P92_S3	For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	ASU 2013-02 became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 and has been applied retrospectively.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-10 permit an entity to designate Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate, also referred to as the overnight index swap rate, as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P94_S2	In addition, the amendment removes the restriction on using different benchmark interest rates for similar hedges.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	This amendment did not have an impact to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 require an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when: (1) a NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position; or (2) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice).
1168696_14_ITEM8_P96_S2	If either of these conditions exists, an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P96_S3	The amendment does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P96_S4	The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P96_S5	The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	The aggregate net cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including an independent third party valuation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P106_S2	The results of operations of the acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following is a summary of the final allocation of the aggregate net cash purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed that have been recognized by the Company in its consolidated balance sheet as of the date of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	The transaction included the acquisition of certain favorable leases and unfavorable leases, which are presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a component of "Intangible Assets, net" and "Other Non-Current Liabilities," respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	22 years and 15 years, respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	The goodwill recorded is fully deductible for tax purposes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM").
1168696_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S3	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S4	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_14_ITEM8_P113_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one -to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO and receipt of proceeds in excess of our investment balance, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	Accordingly, we will not provide for any additional losses as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P114_S2	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P114_S3	Until such time, equity in earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P114_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P116_S1	The modification extended the term of the exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") to 30 years , provided National CineMedia with a 5 -year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.0756 payment per patron which will increase by 8% every 5 years and starting at the end of fiscal 2011, a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which will increase by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $1,072 for fiscal 2013) and an additional payment per digital screen of $551 for fiscal 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P117_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P117_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P117_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P117_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P117_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million , which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P118_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P118_S2	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	AMC and Cinemark also amended and restated their respective ESAs with National CineMedia in connection with the sale.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P120_S1	The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P120_S2	Those provisions are now contained in Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the Digital ESAs ) that were entered into on December 26, 2013 by National CineMedia and each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark, respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P120_S3	These Digital ESA s were then assigned by National CineMedia to AC JV, LLC as part of the sale.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P121_S1	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement was created to account for changes in the number of theatre screens operated by each of the joint venture partners.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	Historically, each of the joint venture partners has increased the number of screens it operates through acquisitions and newly built theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P122_S1	Since the increased attendance associated with these incremental screens in turn provides for additional advertising revenues to National CineMedia, National CineMedia agreed to compensate the joint venture partners by issuing additional common membership units to the joint venture partners in consideration for their increased attendance from newly built theatres and acquisitions and overall contribution to the joint venture.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P122_S2	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement also provides protection to National CineMedia in that the joint venture partners may be required to transfer or surrender common units to National CineMedia based on certain limited events, including declines in attendance associated with certain closed theatres and the number of screens operated.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P122_S3	As a result, each joint venture partner's equity ownership interests are proportionately adjusted to reflect the risks and rewards relative to their contributions to the joint venture.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement provides that transfers of common units are solely between the joint venture partners and National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	There are no transfers of units among the joint venture partners.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	In addition, there are no circumstances under which common units would be surrendered by the Company to National CineMedia in the event of an acquisition by one of the joint venture partners.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P123_S3	However, adjustments to the common units owned by one of the joint venture partners will result in an adjustment to the Company's equity ownership interest percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P124_S1	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P124_S2	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P124_S3	If the Company elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Additional Investments Tranche at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for the Additional Investments Tranche common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a non-operating gain or loss.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 26, 2013 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 10.8 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 2-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P127_S1	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	The NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in Regal's proportionate share of tax basis in NCM Inc.'s tangible and intangible assets.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P128_S1	On the IPO date, NCM, Inc., the Company, AMC and Cinemark entered into a tax receivable agreement.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P128_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, NCM, Inc. will make cash payments to us, AMC and Cinemark in amounts equal to 90% of NCM, Inc.'s actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the intangible assets described above.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P128_S3	For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax will be computed by comparing NCM, Inc.'s actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NCM, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase in NCM Inc.'s proportionate share of tax basis in NCM's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P128_S4	The tax receivable agreement shall generally apply to NCM, Inc.'s taxable years up to and including the 30 t h anniversary date of the NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P128_S5	Pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, the Company received payments of $4.6 million from NCM, Inc. during the year ended December 26, 2013 with respect to NCM, Inc.'s 2011 and 2012 taxable years.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	As of December 26, 2013, the Company maintained two effective hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements (maturing June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively), which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.325% to 1.820% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P187_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated to hedge $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 4.16% as of December 26, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	Under the terms of the Company s two effective interest rate swap agreements as of December 26, 2013 detailed below, Regal Cinemas currently receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR on the first $300.0 million of aggregate borrowings under the Term Facility and will receive 1-month LIBOR on the next $350.0 million under the Term Facility when the remaining two swap agreements become effective.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P188_S1	With respect to the Company's two effective interest rate swap agreements as of December 26, 2013, the 3-month LIBOR rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three-month period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P188_S2	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P188_S3	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for the counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P189_S1	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_14_ITEM8_P189_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P189_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	Below is a summary of the Company s current interest rate swap agreements designated as hedge agreements as of December 26, 2013 :

1168696_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	See Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	These obligations primarily represent lease financing obligations resulting from the requirements of ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P195_S1	In connection with the acquisition of Hollywood Theaters discussed further in Note 3 "Acquisitions," the Company assumed approximately $40.4 million of lease financing obligations associated with 14 acquired theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P195_S2	Such obligations have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 10.7% and mature in various installments through November 2028.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	Maturities of Debt Obligations The Company's long-term debt and future minimum lease payments for its capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements are scheduled to mature as follows:
1168696_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	Covenant Compliance As of December 26, 2013 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	The Company accounts for a majority of its leases as operating leases.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P198_S1	Minimum rentals payable under all non-cancelable operating leases with terms in excess of one year as of December 26, 2013 , are summarized for the following fiscal years (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	Rent expense under such operating leases amounted to $413.6 million , $384.4 million and $381.5 million for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , respectively.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company has historically entered into sale and leaseback transactions whereby owned properties were sold and leased back under operating leases.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	The minimum rentals for these operating leases are included in the table above.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	In December 1995, United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ("UATC") entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby 31 owned properties were sold to and leased back from an unaffiliated third party.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	In conjunction with the transaction, the buyer of the properties issued publicly traded pass-through certificates.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	entered into a Participation Agreement that requires UATC to comply with various covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, guarantees, issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries and subsidiary distributions, transfer of assets and payment of dividends.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	As of December 26, 2013 , 11 theat res were subject to the sale leaseback transaction and approximately $14.7 million in principal amount of pass-through certificates were outstanding.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes for income from operations are as follows (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	During the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , a current tax benefit of $0.4 million , $1.5 million and $0.4 million , respectively, was allocated directly to stockholders' equity for the exercise of stock options and dividends paid on restricted stock.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes as reported and the amount computed by multiplying the income before taxes and extraordinary item by the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% was as follows (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax asset consisted of the following at (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	At December 26, 2013 , the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $137.9 million with expiration commencing in 2016.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P207_S1	The Company's net operating loss carryforwards were generated by the entities of United Artists, Edwards and Hollywood Theaters.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an "ownership change" of a corporation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize the net operating losses acquired from United Artists, Edwards and Hollywood Theaters may be impaired as a result of the "ownership change" limitations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	In assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P209_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P209_S2	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $34.1 million and $16.2 million as of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , respectively, as management believes it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in future tax periods.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P209_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P209_S4	During the year ended December 26, 2013 , the valuation allowance was increased by $16.9 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain federal and state net operating losses generated by Hollywood Theaters entities prior to the acquisition would not be realized.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P209_S5	Also during the year ended December 26, 2013 , the valuation allowance was increased by $1.0 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created during the year ended December 26, 2013 would not be realized.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	Effective December 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P210_S1	A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 was as follows (in millions):
1168696_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $1.5 million and $2.5 million within the next twelve months due the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P212_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 was $7.1 million .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P212_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 were approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P213_S1	As of December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , the Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of approximately $1.8 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P213_S2	The total amount of interest and penalties increased during the year ended December 26, 2013 by $0.2 million in connection with the Hollywood Theaters acquisition for uncertain state tax positions taken by the Hollywood Theaters entities prior to the acquisition.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P213_S3	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of income for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 was $0.0 million , $(2.0) million and $(0.8) million , respectively.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P214_S1	The Company is not subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010, and with limited exceptions, is not subject to state income tax examinations for years before 2009.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P214_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	As further described in Note 4 "Investments," the Company maintains an investment in National CineMedia, a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P215_S1	NCM Inc., in its capacity as tax matters partner for National CineMedia, received documentation from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") during the year ended December 26, 2013 formally closing an IRS review of National CineMedia's 2007 and 2008 income tax returns.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P215_S2	All issues were resolved in National CineMedia's favor and resulted in no adjustments.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Company is presently involved in various judicial, administrative, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business operations, including but not limited to, personal injury claims, landlord-tenant disputes, employment and other contractual matters, some of which are described below.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P216_S1	Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P216_S2	The Company's theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P217_S0	On October 9, 2012, staff at the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Board (the "Regional Board") notified United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ( UATC ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that the Regional Board was contemplating issuing a cleanup and abatement order to UATC with respect to a property in Santa Clara, California that UATC owned and then leased during the 1960s and 1970s.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P217_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Regional Board issued a tentative order to UATC setting out proposed site clean-up requirements for UATC with respect to the property.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P217_S2	According to the Regional Board, the property in question has been contaminated by dry-cleaning facilities that operated at the property in question from approximately 1961 until 1996.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P217_S3	The Regional Board also issued a tentative order to the current property owner, who has been conducting site investigation and remediation activities at the site for several years.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P217_S4	UATC submitted comments to the Regional Board on July 28, 2013, objecting to the tentative order.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P217_S5	The Regional Board considered the matter at its regular meeting on September 11, 2013 and adopted the tentative order with only minor changes.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P218_S0	On October 11, 2013, UATC filed a petition with the State Water Resources Control Board ( State Board ) for review of the Regional Board s order.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P218_S1	The State Board has not yet acted on the petition.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P218_S2	UATC is complying with the Regional Board's order while its petition remains pending before the State Board.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P218_S3	UATC intends to vigorously defend this matter.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P218_S4	We believe that we are, and were during the period in question described in this paragraph, in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P219_S0	In situations where management believes that a loss arising from the above and similar other proceedings is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no amount within the range is more probable than another.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P219_S1	As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these proceedings is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P220_S0	amounts reserved for such proceedings totaled approximately $2.8 million (primarily landlord-tenant disputes) as of December 26, 2013.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P220_S1	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P220_S2	Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Company believes the risk of loss is more than slight.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P220_S3	Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for cases described below in which damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal issues presented.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P220_S4	However, for these cases, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the Company s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P221_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P221_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P222_S0	In prior years, private litigants and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") had filed claims against the Company alleging that a number of theatres with stadium seating violated the ADA because these theatres allegedly failed to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with lines of sight comparable to those available to other members of the general public and denied persons in wheelchairs access to the stadium portion of the theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P222_S1	On June 8, 2005, Regal reached an agreement with the DOJ resolving and dismissing the private litigants claims and all claims made by the United States under the ADA.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P276_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P277_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P277_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P277_S2	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, vesting of restricted stock and performance share units, the assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes and the warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes prior to redemption in March 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P277_S3	The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock, performance share units, and the warrant issued in connection with the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P277_S4	The dilutive effect of assumed conversion of the 6 1 / 4 % Convertible Senior Notes is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if-converted method.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P277_S5	In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P278_S0	The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P278_S1	The undistributed earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the periods presented had been distributed.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P278_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P278_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P279_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share and per share data):

1168696_14_ITEM8_P281_S0	Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P281_S1	The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P282_S0	The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P282_S1	Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:
1168696_14_ITEM8_P283_S0	Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P284_S0	Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P284_S1	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P285_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 26, 2013 :

1168696_14_ITEM8_P286_S2	The fair value of the RealD, Inc. shares is determined using RealD, Inc.'s publicly traded common stock price, which falls under Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P286_S3	The held shares of RealD, Inc. stock are accounted for as available-for-sale equity securities and recurring fair value adjustments to these shares are recorded to "Other Non-Current Assets" with a corresponding entry to "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" on a quarterly basis.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P286_S4	During the quarter ended June 27, 2013, the Company sold 400,000 shares of RealD, Inc. common stock at prices ranging from $14.61 to $15.42 per share.

1168696_14_ITEM8_P286_S6	During the year ended December 26, 2013, the Company recorded a net decrease to its investment in RealD, Inc. of approximately $6.2 million and a corresponding net increase to "Accumulated other comprehensive income, net" of $1.8 million , net of tax.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P286_S7	The fair value of the remaining 822,780 RealD, Inc. common shares was $7.0 million , based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 26, 2013 of $8.46 per share.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P286_S8	(2) The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations" is based on Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P287_S0	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P287_S1	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P287_S2	These interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness during the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 and accordingly, the net gain on the swaps of $2.3 million , $2.8 million and $8.0 million , respectively, were reported as a component of other comprehensive income for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P288_S0	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P288_S1	There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P289_S0	In addition, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P289_S1	The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument are as follows:
1168696_14_ITEM8_P290_S0	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
1168696_14_ITEM8_P291_S0	The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P292_S0	As further described in Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the Company regularly reviews long-lived assets (primarily property and equipment), intangible assets and investments in non-consolidated entities, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P292_S1	When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P293_S0	The Company s analysis relative to long-lived assets resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $9.5 million , $11.1 million and $17.9 million for the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 , respectively.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P293_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P294_S0	During the year ended December 26, 2013 , the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million pertaining to certain favorable leases associated with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P294_S1	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended December 27, 2012 and December 29, 2011 .
1168696_14_ITEM8_P295_S0	During the year ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P295_S1	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately 6 months ) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P295_S2	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P295_S3	The Company did not record an impairment of any investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method during the years ended December 26, 2013 , December 27, 2012 or December 29, 2011 .

1168696_14_ITEM8_P297_S1	The associated interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and are assumed to approximate fair value.
1168696_14_ITEM8_P297_S2	The fair values of the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes, the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 are estimated based on quoted prices (Level 1 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) for these issuances as of December 26, 2013 and, for the 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and the 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes, December 27, 2012 .

1168696_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 7,367 screens in 574 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of January 1, 2015 , with approximately 220 million attendees for the fifty-three week fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 ("fiscal 2014 ").
1168696_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	We operate multi-screen theatres and, as of January 1, 2015 , had an average of 12.8 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	For fiscal 2014 and prior periods, the Company's fiscal year ended on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) resulted in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 27, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company s fiscal year from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25 of each year to a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year, effective with the fiscal year commencing January 2, 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	Beginning January 2, 2015, the Company s quarterly results will be for three month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	For fiscal 2014 , we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $2,990.1 million , $306.4 million and $105.6 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	In addition, we generated $349.1 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to allocate capital effectively to enhance value for our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	This strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by distributing value to our stockholders, capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatre assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S5	Key elements of our business strategy include: Maximizing Stockholder Value.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P4_S6	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	dividend of $1.00 per share of Class A and Class B common stock (approximately $156.2 million in the aggregate) paid on December 15, 2014.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	On October 27, 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, which included a potential sale of the Company.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	On January 15, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors, in the course of its examination of strategic alternatives and with the advice of Morgan Stanley Co.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	LLC after a thorough market review, has determined that a sale of the Company would not be in the best interest of its stockholders at such time.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	The Company's Board of Directors, consistent with its fiduciary duties, remains committed to evaluating any alternatives that would enhance stockholder value.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S5	For example, during fiscal 2012 and 2013, we completed the acquisitions of Hollywood Theaters and Great Escape Theatres, whereby we acquired a total of 68 theatres with 814 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of $284.1 million.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S6	The acquisitions enhanced the Company s presence in 16 states and 3 U.S. territories.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P7_S7	See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	With respect to partnership initiatives, we own approximately 20.1% of National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM") as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America and concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC"), and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	We also participate in other joint ventures such as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, Open Road Films and AC JV, LLC, which are also further discussed under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K. Finally, the Company is a party to a joint venture with certain exhibitors and distributors called Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition ("DCDC").
1168696_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	DCDC has established a satellite distribution network that distributes digital content to theatres via satellite.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe our investment in National CineMedia and other joint venture arrangements generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	We intend to continue to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts:
1168696_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	First, we intend to continue our focus on improving customer amenities, including the installation of luxury reclining seats, and experimentation with various other customer engagement and marketing initiatives aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of January 1, 2015 , we offered luxury reclining seating in 336 auditoriums at 32 select theatre locations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	Based on promising initial results, we expect to offer luxury reclining seating in approximately 40 additional locations by the end of fiscal 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from our theatre landlords.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Second, to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	As of January 1, 2015 , we offered an expanded menu of food and/or alcoholic beverage items in 159 locations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 180 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 130 locations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	In addition, as of January 1, 2015 , we have successfully launched seven Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Third, we believe that our IMAX digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	As of January 1, 2015 , our IMAX footprint consisted of a total of 86 IMAX screens and we also operated a total of 86 RPX SM screens.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	We have been encouraged by the operating results of our IMAX and RPX SM screens and to that end, we intend to install additional IMAX digital projection systems and RPX SM screens during fiscal 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Finally, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry, and these members accounted for approximately $1.0 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2014.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	In addition, our mobile ticketing application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 2.5 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal (including Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions) and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe the experimentation with customer amenities and engagement initiatives, the broadening of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings, coupled with the product-driven success of our IMAX screens and growing portfolio of RPX SM screens, allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for substantially all of our customers.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	We believe this strategy will enable us to differentiate our services in certain markets and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Pursuing Selective Growth Opportunities and Active Asset Management.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction and acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	Additionally, we manage our asset base by opportunistically closing underperforming theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	To that end, during fiscal 2014, we continued to actively manage our asset base by opening nine new theatres with 98 screens and closing 15 theatres with 125 screens, ending the year with 574 theatres and 7,367 screens.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	In summary, we believe our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatres assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities: Industry Leader.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	We are the largest domestic motion picture exhibitor operating 7,367 screens in 574 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	Our operating philosophy focuses on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S5	At the corporate level, we are able to capitalize on our size and operational expertise to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P19_S6	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of financial data analysis, detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Since our 2002 IPO, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of nine theatre circuits, consisting of 225 theatres and 2,622 screens.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	We have generally achieved immediate cost savings at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P21_S4	As of January 1, 2015 , approximately 78% of our locations featured stadium seating and approximately 79% of our theatres had 10 or more screens.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P21_S5	In addition, approximately 42% of our locations featured one or more premium amenity offerings as of January 1, 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our theatres have an average of 12.8 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	We believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S3	To that end, during fiscal 2014 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.6 million in the aggregate.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S4	In addition, on December 15, 2014, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $156.2 million .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S5	Further, on February 12, 2015 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P22_S6	The dividend is payable on March 13, 2015 to our stockholders of record on March 3, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our Board of Directors.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2014 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues and attendance, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and in turn box office revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P24_S3	Consequently, we expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P24_S4	However, we believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the domestic motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P24_S5	For example, even during the most recent recessionary period, attendance levels remained stable.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Through the years, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering content to consumers, including network and syndicated television, cable and satellite television services, in-home video and DVD and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its in-home video or DVD release has contracted slightly to approximately three to four months.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S5	Finally, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of experimenting with and implementing various initiatives, concepts and customer amenities aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to differentiate services and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S6	These initiatives include reserved seating and luxury reclining seating, broadening food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service, the enhancement of loyalty programs and other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S7	In addition, we believe the benefits associated with premium motion picture formats are significant for our industry and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue from formats such as IMAX and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S8	Finally, we believe that operating a digital theatre circuit provides greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which has enhanced our capacity utilization, and enables us to generate incremental revenue from differentiated motion picture formats, such as digital 3D, and the exhibition of specialty content offerings through certain distributors of specialty content, such as AC JV, LLC.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P26_S9	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	THEATRE OPERATIONS We operate the largest theatre circuit in the United States with 7,367 screens in 574 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	We operate theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas, which include locations in suburban growth areas.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S5	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S6	In addition, many of our theatres feature state-of-the-art amenities such as immersive wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling screens, Sony Digital Cinema TM 4K projection systems, 3D digital projection systems, digital stereo surround-sound, closed-captioning, multi-station concessions stands, computerized ticketing systems, plush stadium seating with cup holders and retractable armrests and enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S7	In addition, we have recently begun a strategic initiative to install luxury reclining seating at select locations in certain of our key markets.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P27_S8	As of January 1, 2015 , we offered luxury reclining seating in 336 auditoriums at 32 select theatre locations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	40 additional locations by the end of fiscal 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from our theatre landlords.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S3	We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S4	In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enables us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising, rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S5	We strategically schedule movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and box office and concession line congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S6	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P28_S7	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, e-gift cards and mobile ticketing.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons and believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of January 1, 2015 :
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	We have implemented a best practices management program across all of our theatres, including daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management reports generated for each individual theatre and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S4	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S5	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities and monitor food service.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S6	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers and various contractual service partners regularly inspect each theatre and provide recurring feedback.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S7	In addition, we consistently solicit feedback from our patrons through an on-line guest experience program whereby our guests rank and provide detailed comments and experiences for each of our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P31_S8	Finally, we also conduct a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing over 20,100 U.S. theatres screens (of which approximately 19,200 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	During 2014, over 700 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which National CineMedia currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), which serves as the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	In connection with the IPO of NCM, Inc., RCM, through its wholly owned subsidiary Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC ("RCH"), AMC and Cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of National CineMedia and other ancillary agreements.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	As a result of these agreements, we receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P34_S3	Subsequent to the IPO of NCM, Inc. and through January 1, 2015 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 11.2 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P34_S4	These transactions, partially offset by the redemption of approximately 6.6 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in underwritten public offerings during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, caused a net increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to 25.8 million common units.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P34_S5	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 20.1% interest in NCM, Inc. as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	During fiscal 2013, National CineMedia sold its "Fathom Events" business to AC JV, LLC ( AC JV ), a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company owned 32% by each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark and 4% by National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Fathom Events business focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to various theatre operators (including us, AMC and Cinemark) to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule and includes events such as live and pre-recorded concerts, opera and symphony, DVD product releases and marketing events, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, live sporting events and other special events.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	In consideration for the sale, National CineMedia received a total of $25 million in promissory notes from RCI, Cinemark and AMC (one-third or approximately $8.3 million from each).
1168696_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	In addition, RCI, AMC and Cinemark each amended and restated its existing exhibitor service agreement with National CineMedia in connection with the sale by National CineMedia of its Fathom Events business.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions, including AC JV.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	We maintain an investment in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	DCIP s initial financing, coupled with a second round of financing completed in March 2011 (which consisted of a new $220.0 million term loan facility), substantially covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	DCIP funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Also during fiscal 2014, the Company received $6.3 million in cash distributions from DCIP as a return on its investment.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	As of January 1, 2015 , we operated 7,333 screens outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	We also maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Open Road Films was created to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	Open Road Films distributed seven films during 2014 which generated national box office revenues of approximately $161.3 million, and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S4	As of January 1, 2015 , we have invested $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and may invest an additional $10.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S5	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of January 1, 2015 was $(10.0) million.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P41_S6	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Open Road Films.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	DISTRIBUTION Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including network and syndicated television, cable and satellite television services, in-home video and DVD and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	A strong opening run at the theatre often establishes a film's success and substantiates the film's revenue potential.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	For example, the revenue streams of home video, DVD and pay cable distribution agreements often contractually depend on the success of a film's theatrical release.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S4	Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S5	In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S6	In zones where there is competition, a distributor will allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P47_S7	When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	The majority of our arrangements use a "sliding scale" formula.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	We have also used a "firm term" formula and a "review or settlement" method.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Under the firm term formula, the exhibitor and distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Lastly, under the review or settlement method, the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	These negotiations typically involve the use of historical settlements or past precedent.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P51_S2	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	For fiscal 2014 , films shown from our ten major film distributors accounted for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	Six of the ten major film distributors each accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2014 admission revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	No single film distributor accounted for more than 20% of fiscal 2014 admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	From year to year, the revenues attributable to individual distributors will vary widely depending upon the number and popularity of films that each one distributes.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 27.7% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2014 .
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S3	We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S4	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S5	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S6	As of January 1, 2015 , we offered an expanded menu of food and/or alcoholic beverage items in 159 locations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S7	By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 180 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 130 locations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S8	In addition, as of January 1, 2015 , we have successfully launched seven Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P54_S9	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	We have several hundred competitors nationwide that vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P56_S3	Our competitors, including newly established motion picture exhibitors, may build new theatres or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P56_S4	If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P56_S5	As the largest motion picture exhibitor, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	As discussed in "Industry Overview and Trends" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of experimenting with various initiatives and concepts aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to differentiate services and build brand loyalty.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given fiscal period.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Other technologies could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Over the past several years, the theatrical release window has contracted slightly to approximately three to four months.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	MARKETING AND ADVERTISING Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	To market our theatres, we utilize Internet, mobile and social media, print and multimedia advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	In many of our markets, we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S3	Our frequent moviegoer loyalty program, Regal Crown Club , is designed to actively engage our core customers and is the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S4	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S5	Through the Regal Crown Club , we seek to enhance the customer experience and increase frequency of purchases to generate additional revenue.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S6	As of January 1, 2015 , we had over 13 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , and these members accounted for approximately $1.0 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2014.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P60_S7	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our mobile ticketing application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 2.5 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P61_S2	Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Information Technology ("IT") is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our theatres, the management of our business and other revenue-generating opportunities.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery and warehouse stores and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S2	We continue to expand our ability to sell tickets remotely by using our Internet ticketing partner, Fandango.com, and by offering self-service alternatives, such as ticketing kiosks, print-at-home ticketing, and mobile ticketing.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S3	Our Apple iPhone or Android phone application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S4	We continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve services to our patrons and provide information to our management, allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S5	In addition, our scheduling systems support the coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S6	The scheduling systems also provide information electronically and automatically to the media outlets, including newspapers and various online media outlets to drive attendance to our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S7	The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as being the primary source of data for our financial systems.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P63_S8	Our revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P64_S3	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	EMPLOYEES As of January 1, 2015 , we employed approximately 23,168 persons.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Shown below are the names, ages as of January 1, 2015 , and current positions of our executive officers.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	There are no family relationships between any of the persons listed below, or between any of such persons and any of the directors of the Company or any persons nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer of the Company.

1168696_15_ITEM1_P71_S4	Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Ownby served with Ernst Young LLP from September 1992 to October 1999.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	REGULATION The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
1168696_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P77_S3	These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
1168696_15_ITEM1_P77_S4	Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For fiscal 2014 , our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately $423.4 million and $126.5 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of January 1, 2015 , we had total debt obligations of $2,360.2 million .
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	As of January 1, 2015 , we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,140.9 million .
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S5	For a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments" provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S6	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S7	As a result, the inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S8	The agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other debt instruments.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S11	In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our and our subsidiaries' cash flows prove inadequate to meet our and their debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our and our subsidiaries' existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets, to obtain additional financing or suspend the payment of dividends.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of, these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with ten major film distributors accounting for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2014 .
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the ten major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S7	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce our revenue.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P3_S8	We compete with other movie delivery vehicles, including network and syndicated television, cable and satellite television services, in-home video and DVD and pay-per-view services such as video on demand, digital downloads and streaming via the Internet.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other delivery vehicles during the theatrical release window.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The average theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months over the last decade.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Further, some film studios have experimented with offering consumers a premium video-on-demand option for certain films approximately two months after their theatrical launch.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Generally, stadium seating found in modern megaplex theatres is preferred by patrons over slope-floored multiplex theatres, which were the predominant theatre-type built prior to 1996.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Although the majority of our locations feature stadium seating, we still serve many markets with sloped-floored multiplex theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These theatres may be more vulnerable to competition than our modern megaplex theatres, and should other theatre operators choose to build and operate modern megaplex theatres in these markets, the performance of our theatres in these markets may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, should other theatre operators return to the aggressive building strategies undertaken in the late 1990's, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Finally, the motion picture exhibition industry continues to experiment with and implement various initiatives, concepts, customer amenities and technological innovations aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its patrons (including, but not limited to, luxury reclining seating, enhancement of food and alcoholic beverage offerings, the installation of premium format screens, digital 3D projection and satellite distribution technologies).
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	While we continue to experiment and implement these initiatives, new innovations will continue to impact our industry.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	If we are unable to respond to or invest in changes in technology and the preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S7	We may not benefit from our strategic acquisition strategy and partnerships.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S8	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In the case of acquisitions, even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S11	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S12	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S13	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P7_S14	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If we cannot generate anticipated cash flows resulting from acquisitions or fail to realize their anticipated benefits, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We also selectively pursue theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As of January 1, 2015 , we own approximately 20.1% of National CineMedia, and participate in other joint ventures such as DCIP, Open Road Films, AC JV and DCDC.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, Open Road Films, AC JV and DCDC or other existing or future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses, power outages and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Economic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Theatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe storms in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	For example, our future ability to borrow on Regal Cinemas' senior credit facility or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	We are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part time workers who are paid at or slightly above the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our theatres must comply with the ADA to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Anschutz Company owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, as of January 1, 2015 , Anschutz Company controlled approximately 78% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	For as long as Anschutz Company continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors, effect stockholder actions by written consent in lieu of stockholder meetings and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Anschutz Company will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to Anschutz Company but not to other stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, Anschutz Company and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that open-market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Company or its affiliates, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As of February 23, 2015 , we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, Anschutz Company and its affiliates are able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted and may chose to do so at any time.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, we cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by Anschutz Company or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders (unless otherwise required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S12	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P20_S13	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries, or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and are subject to various business considerations.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2023 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2025 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 to 20 years.
1168696_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_15_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_15_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that these facilities are adequate for our operations.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 23, 2015 , there were approximately 257 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and one stockholder of record of our Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 23, 2015 our officers, directors and key employees hold, or in the case of performance shares are eligible to receive, approximately 1,569,734 restricted shares of our Class A common stock, for which the restrictions lapse or the performance criteria and vesting may be satisfied, at various dates through January 28, 2019.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	All shares of restricted stock are registered and will be freely tradable when the restrictions lapse, unless such shares are issued to or acquired by an affiliate of Regal, in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	During fiscal 2014 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.6 million in the aggregate.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	In addition, on December 15, 2014, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $156.2 million.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	During fiscal 2013, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $132.2 million in the aggregate.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	Finally, on February 12, 2015 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S4	The dividend is payable on March 13, 2015 to our stockholders of record on March 3, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S5	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S6	We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S7	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P2_S8	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None.
1168696_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	(2) Includes the December 15, 2014 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	(3) Includes the December 27, 2012 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S2	(4) Includes the December 30, 2010 payment of the $1.40 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S3	(5) During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we redeemed 4.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $16.00 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by $14.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S4	We received approximately $66.0 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of $52.0 million.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S5	During the quarter ended September 26, 2013, we redeemed 2.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which the Company sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $17.79 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by approximately $10.0 million , the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S6	The Company received approximately $40.9 million in proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $30.9 million .
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S7	We accounted for these transactions as a proportionate decrease in the Company's Initial Investment Tranche and Additional Investments Tranche and decreased our ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P0_S8	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	(6) During the years ended January 1, 2015, December 26, 2013, December 27, 2012, December 29, 2011, and December 30, 2010, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $5.6 million, $9.5 million, $11.1 million, $17.9 million, and $10.3 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P1_S1	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(7) During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P2_S1	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P2_S2	As a result, the Company recorded a $13.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write-down its cost basis in RealD, Inc. to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_15_ITEM6_P2_S3	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview and Basis of Presentation We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 7,367 screens in 574 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which concentrates on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and discount ticket programs, various other activities in our theatres and our relationship with National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to maximize our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company's revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	The emergence or continuance of a "hit" film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S5	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P3_S6	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	We evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions, which include those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, deferred revenue pertaining to gift card and discount ticket sales, income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P7_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Generally, less than one-third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play, but is typically "settled" within two to three months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film's initial box office receipts.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	As a result, there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable, because we make such estimates based on each film's box office receipts through the end of the reporting period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an estimated useful life of 30 years.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life, and their depreciable lives (10-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolete, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P14_S8	Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	For the fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 , consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $207.2 million , representing 6.9% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately $13.0 million, or 6.3%.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $14.9 million, or 7.2%.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P19_S8	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	For fiscal 2014 , our provision for income taxes was $73.4 million .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained, the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 41.1% to 42.1% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $1.8 million.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	As noted in our significant accounting policies for "Revenue Recognition" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to cash received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company recognizes revenue as a component of "Other operating revenues" associated with discount tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience, when the likelihood of redemption is remote, and when there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card and discount ticket items to the relevant jurisdiction.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of historical redemption trends and considers various factors including the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Significant Events and Fiscal 2015 Outlook During the fifty-three week fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 (" Fiscal 2014 Period ") and the fifty-two week fiscal years ended December 26, 2013 (" Fiscal 2013 Period ") and December 27, 2012 (" Fiscal 2012 Period "), the Company entered into various investing and financing transactions which are more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During the Fiscal 2014 Period, we continued to make progress with respect to our business strategy as follows:
1168696_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	During the Fiscal 2014 Period , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share, or approximately $138.6 million in the aggregate.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	In addition, on December 15, 2014, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share, or approximately $156.2 million .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	We continued to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts:
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	First, we continued our focus on improving customer amenities, including the installation of luxury reclining seats, and experimentation with various other customer engagement and marketing initiatives aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of January 1, 2015 , we offered luxury reclining seating in 336 auditoriums at 32 select theatre locations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	Based on promising initial results, we expect to offer luxury reclining seating in approximately 40 additional locations by the end of fiscal 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from our theatre landlords.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	Second, to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S5	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S6	As of January 1, 2015 , we offered an expanded menu of food and/or alcoholic beverage items in 159 locations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S7	By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 180 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 130 locations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S8	In addition, as of January 1, 2015 , we have successfully launched seven Cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options, including beer and wine, served at the customer's seat before and during the featured film.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S9	Third, we believe that our IMAX digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S10	As of January 1, 2015 , our IMAX footprint consisted of a total of 86 IMAX screens and we also operated a total of 86 RPX SM screens.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S11	We have been encouraged by the operating results of our IMAX and RPX SM screens and to that end, we intend to install additional IMAX digital projection systems and RPX SM screens during fiscal 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S12	Finally, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S13	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S14	As of January 1, 2015 , we had over 13 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry, and these members accounted for approximately $1.0 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S15	In addition, our mobile ticketing application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 2.5 million times since its Fiscal 2012 Period launch.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P28_S16	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal (including Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions) and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Finally, we believe Open Road Films fills a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner and will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	during 2014 which generated national box office revenues of approximately $161.3 million, and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of January 1, 2015 , we have invested $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and may invest an additional $10.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	We believe our investment in Open Road Films will generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	We are optimistic regarding the breadth of the 2015 film slate, including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	Evidenced by the motion picture studios' continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases, 2015 appears to be another year of high-profile releases such as Fifty Shades of Grey, Insurgent, Furious 7, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mad Max: Fury Road, Tomorrowland, Jurassic World, Inside Out, Ted 2, Minions, Ant-Man, The Fantastic Four, Spectre, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Mission: Impossible 5.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	We intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	With respect to capital expenditures, subject to the timing of certain construction projects, we expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales and landlord contributions) to be in the range of $135.0 million to $145.0 million for fiscal 2015 , consisting of new theatre development, expansion of existing theatre facilities, upgrades for premium amenities, and maintenance.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Overall for the fiscal 2015 year, we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	In addition, we expect fiscal 2015 admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P31_S4	We will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities, selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P31_S5	For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Recent Developments On October 27, 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, which included a potential sale of the Company.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	On January 15, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors, in the course of its examination of strategic alternatives and with the advice of Morgan Stanley Co.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	LLC after a thorough market review, has determined that a sale of the Company would not be in the best interest of its stockholders at such time.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	The Company's Board of Directors, consistent with its fiduciary duties, remains committed to evaluating any alternatives that would enhance stockholder value.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	On February 12, 2015 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The dividend is payable on March 13, 2015 to our stockholders of record on March 3, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Results of Operations Based on our review of industry sources, North American box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to the Fiscal 2014 Period were estimated to have decreased by approximately one to two percent in comparison to the period of time that corresponds to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The industry's box office results for 2014 were negatively impacted by comparisons to record box office results experienced in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items included in our consolidated statements of income for the Fiscal 2014 Period, the Fiscal 2013 Period and the Fiscal 2012 Period (dollars and attendance in millions, except average ticket prices and average concessions per patron):
1168696_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ * Not meaningful (1) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	(2) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of concessions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	(3) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of total revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Fiscal 2014 Period Compared to Fiscal 2013 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2014 Period, total admissions revenues decreased $60.7 million , or 2.9% , to $1,998.9 million , from $2,059.6 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	A 3.7% decrease in attendance (approximately $76.2 million of total admissions revenues), partially offset by a 0.8% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $15.5 million of total admissions revenues) led to the overall decrease in the Fiscal 2014 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	fifty-two weeks during the Fiscal 2013 Period and the inclusion of the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters for the entire Fiscal 2014 Period (compared to nine months in the Fiscal 2013 Period).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The additional week of operations was the week between Christmas and New Years, a traditionally high attendance and revenue week for the Company and the industry.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	The additional week of operations was significant in that it accounted for approximately 8.7 million attendees, or 4.0%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total attendance and contributed to approximately $76.5 million, or 3.8%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	Excluding week 53, the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters accounted for 11.8 million attendees, or 5.4%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total attendance and contributed approximately $90.2 million, or 4.5%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	However, these factors were offset by the impact of the decline in industry attendance during the Fiscal 2014 Period and as a result, total attendance for the Company's Fiscal 2014 Period decreased by 3.7%.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S5	The overall decline in attendance and admissions revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily a result of strong attendance generated by the breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period, which experienced record box office revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S6	On a comparable screen basis (i.e., excluding the effects of the impact of week 53 in the Fiscal 2014 Period and the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters for the Fiscal 2014 Period and Fiscal 2013 Period), attendance for the Fiscal 2014 Period was approximately 199.7 million , an 8.6% decrease from the Fiscal 2013 Period, and admissions revenues for the Fiscal 2014 Period was approximately $1,832.2 million , a decrease of $150.6 million or 7.6% from the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P36_S7	On a comparable screen basis, an 8.6% decrease in attendance (approximately $170.5 million of admissions revenues), partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $19.9 million of admissions revenues) led to the net decline in the Fiscal 2014 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	We believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the motion picture studios.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The decline in comparable screen attendance and admissions revenues was primarily a result of the aforementioned breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	The increase in our comparable screen average ticket price was due to selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews, partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium format films exhibited during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the decrease in our comparable screen admissions revenues on a per screen basis was greater than the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	We believe the greater than industry decrease in comparable screen admissions revenues on a per screen basis in the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to premium format film performance and the impact of our competitors' investment in new theatres and customer amenities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S5	We are optimistic that our investments in new theatre construction and premium amenities will provide the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P37_S6	To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given fiscal period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Concessions Total concessions revenues increased $12.7 million , or 1.6% , to $829.6 million during the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $816.9 million for the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	A 5.6% increase in average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $42.9 million of total concessions revenues), partially offset by a 3.7% decrease in attendance (approximately $30.2 million of total concessions revenues) led to the overall increase in the Fiscal 2014 Period concessions revenue.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	On a comparable screen basis, total concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2014 Period was $752.1 million , a decrease of $28.1 million or 3.6% from the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	Such decrease was primarily attributable to the aforementioned 8.6% decrease in comparable screen attendance (approximately $67.1 million of concessions revenues), partially offset by a 5.6% increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $39.0 million of concessions revenues).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	The increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume per patron, selective price increases during the period and to a lesser extent, the continued rollout of our expanded food and alcohol menu.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues of $161.6 million during the Fiscal 2014 Period was consistent with that of the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	Included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire), revenues from our vendor marketing programs, other theatre revenues (consisting of theatre rentals, internet ticketing surcharges, arcade games and other) and revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P38_S7	During the Fiscal 2014 Period, other operating revenues were primarily impacted by a decrease in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs (approximately $5.9 million) and decreases in revenues from our vendor marketing programs (approximately $1.0 million), offset by incremental National CineMedia revenues (approximately $3.9 million) and increases in other theatre revenues (approximately $3.0 million).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Film Rental and Advertising Costs Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues of 52.4% during the Fiscal 2014 Period was in line with that of the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cost of Concessions During the Fiscal 2014 Period, cost of concessions decreased $0.5 million , or 0.4% , to $111.1 million as compared to $111.6 million during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2014 Period was approximately 13.4% , compared to 13.7% during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily related to an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenues recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions and the impact of the aforementioned price increases during the period, partially offset by slight increases in raw material costs.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Rent Expense Rent expense increased by $9.8 million , or 2.4% , to $423.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $413.6 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	The increase in rent expense during the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily related to the opening of several new theatres late in the Fiscal 2013 Period, the opening of nine new theatres with 98 screens (partially offset by the closure of 15 theatres with 125 screens) subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2013 Period and incremental rent associated with the leases acquired as part of the Hollywood Theaters acquisition.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	On a comparable screen basis, rent expense increased $5.9 million , or 1.5% , during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S6	On a comparable screen basis, the increase in rent expense in the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to the opening of several new theatres late in the Fiscal 2013 Period and the opening of nine new theatres with 98 screens (partially offset by the closure of 15 theatres with 125 screens) subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S7	Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $0.4 million , to $813.2 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $812.8 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S8	During the Fiscal 2014 Period, other operating expenses was primarily impacted by increases in theatre level payroll expenses (approximately $11.1 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period) and increased non-rent occupancy costs (approximately $11.1 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period) primarily associated with the impact of the fifty-three weeks of operations and the inclusion of 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters, partially offset by the impact of the State of New York sales tax refund received by the Company during the Fiscal 2014 Period totaling approximately $16.8 million (described further in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and decreased costs (approximately $3.5 million) associated with lower premium format film revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S9	On a comparable screen basis, other operating expenses decreased $24.6 million , or 3.2% during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S10	Such decrease was attributable to the aforementioned State of New York sales tax refund and decreased costs associated with lower premium format film revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S11	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million , or 0.9% , to $74.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $73.7 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S12	The increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to higher payroll costs associated with an additional week of operations, partially offset by lower legal and professional fees associated with the Fiscal 2013 Period acquisition of Hollywood Theaters and slightly lower travel costs.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S13	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $7.0 million , or 3.5% , to $207.2 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $200.2 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S14	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with increased capital expenditures during the Fiscal 2014 Period, the addition of the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters, the opening of several new theatres late in the Fiscal 2013 Period and the opening of nine new theatres with 98 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P40_S15	On a comparable screen basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.0 million, or 1.6% during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	On a comparable screen basis, the 2.2% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $42.1 million of admissions revenues), partially offset by the 1.7% decrease in attendance (approximately $32.7 million of admissions revenues), led to the increase in the Fiscal 2013 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P44_S5	The comparable screen average ticket price increase was due to selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews (which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary trends and local market conditions).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P44_S6	The decrease in comparable screen attendance during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to difficult comparisons with the strong attendance experienced in the Fiscal 2012 Period from such pictures as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and The Hunger Games , partially offset by the breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	sources, the increase in our admissions revenues on a comparable screen basis was in line with the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	On a comparable screen basis, total concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2013 Period was $757.6 million, an increase of $10.8 million or 1.4% from the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P45_S4	On a comparable screen basis, the increase in total concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to a 3.2% increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $23.5 million of concessions revenues), partially offset by the aforementioned 1.7% decrease in comparable screen attendance (approximately $12.7 million of concessions revenues) during the period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P45_S5	The increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily a result of an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume and to a lesser extent, selective price increases and the continued rollout of our expanded food menu during the period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P45_S6	Other Operating Revenues During the Fiscal 2013 Period, other operating revenues increased $15.1 million, or 10.3%, to $161.6 million, from $146.5 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P45_S8	The increase in other operating revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period was principally due to increases in revenues from our vendor marketing programs (approximately $9.2 million) and increases in other theatre revenues (approximately $4.8 million).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Film Rental and Advertising Costs Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues increased to 52.3% during the Fiscal 2013 Period from 52.0% in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of box office revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to the overall increase in box office revenues associated with the breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period and an increase in promotional costs associated with new theatre openings.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Cost of Concessions During the Fiscal 2013 Period, cost of concessions increased $10.5 million, or 10.4%, to $111.6 million as compared to $101.1 million during the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	The increase in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily related to slightly higher raw material and packaged good costs, partially offset by an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenue recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S5	Rent Expense Rent expense increased by $29.2 million, or 7.6%, to $413.6 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $384.4 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S8	On a comparable screen basis, the increase in rent expense in the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to higher contingent rent associated with increased admissions and concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2013 Period and incremental rent associated with the opening of eight new theatres with 98 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2012 Period, partially offset by the closure of 11 theatres with 101 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S9	Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $76.9 million, or 10.4%, to $812.8 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $735.9 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P46_S10	The increase in other operating expenses during the Fiscal 2013 Period was attributable to increases in certain non-rent occupancy costs (approximately $30.3 million for the Fiscal 2013 Period) and theatre level payroll expenses (approximately $25.4 million for the Fiscal 2013 Period) associated with the impact of the 814 screens from Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to transaction costs associated with our recent acquisitions (approximately $3.2 million) and higher corporate payroll costs during the period, partially offset by slightly lower share-based compensation expense.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $17.1 million, or 9.3%, to $200.2 million for the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $183.1 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily related to incremental depreciation and amortization expense associated with the addition of the 814 screens from Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P47_S7	The increase in income from operations during the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to the increase in total revenues, partially offset by increases in certain variable operating expense line items described above.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P47_S8	Interest Expense, net During the Fiscal 2013 Period, net interest expense increased $6.3 million, or 4.7%, to $141.3 million, from $135.0 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P47_S9	The increase in net interest expense during the Fiscal 2013 Period was principally due to incremental interest associated with the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and the capital lease and lease financing obligations assumed from Hollywood Theaters, partially offset by interest savings associated with the partial refinance of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes with the proceeds from the second quarter of 2013 issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and a lower effective interest rate on our Term Facility (including a change in our interest rate swap portfolio).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Earnings Recognized from NCM Earnings recognized from NCM increased $2.7 million, or 7.8%, to $37.5 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period, from $34.8 million in the Fiscal 2012 Period.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2013 Period is primarily attributable to changes in uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities resulting from the lapse of statute of limitations that occurred in the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and other income tax credits.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest Net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2013 Period was $157.7 million, which represents an increase of $15.4 million, from net income attributable to controlling interest of $142.3 million during the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	The increase in net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock recorded during the third quarter of the Fiscal 2013 Period and higher equity earnings generated by certain of our equity method investments, partially offset by the impact of the $30.3 million ($19.2 million after related tax effects) loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Quarterly Results The Company's consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal 2013 Period include the results of operations of Hollywood Theaters, consisting of 43 theatres and 513 screens, for the period subsequent to the acquisition date of March 29, 2013.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P53_S6	We received approximately $40.9 million in proceeds after deducting related fees and expenses payable by us, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $30.9 million.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P53_S7	(6) Reflects the impact of the $30.3 million ($19.2 million after related tax effects) loss on debt extinguishment recorded during the quarter ended June 27, 2013 related to the repurchase of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources On a consolidated basis, we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes related to corporate operations, debt service and the Company's dividend payments.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	The principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the Credit Agreement described below.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, Regal Cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to Regal, its indirect parent.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Since Regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries, this restriction could impact Regal's ability to effect future debt or dividend payments, pay corporate expenses, repurchase or retire for cash its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	In addition, as described further below, the indentures under which the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023, and the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 are issued limit the Company's (and its restricted subsidiaries') ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, make loans or advances to its subsidiaries, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs, rent and occupancy and payroll.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within 30 days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the Company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately 30 to 35 days from purchase.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our current liabilities include items that will become due within 12 months.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	In addition, from time to time, we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and other financing activities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	As a result, at any given time, our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $349.1 million , $346.9 million and $346.6 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period, the Fiscal 2013 Period and the Fiscal 2012 Period, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The $2.2 million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period increase was caused by a $40.1 million increase in net income excluding non-cash items, largely offset by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $37.9 million.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Working capital activity was primarily impacted by changes in accrued expense and other activity and deferred revenue, partially offset by changes in accounts receivable activity during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The change in accrued expense and other activity was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments associated with increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	The change in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased redemptions during our 53rd week of operations in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S5	The change in accounts receivable activity was attributable to the timing of collections as a result of the additional week of operations during Fiscal 2014 Period The $0.3 million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period increase was caused by a positive fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $63.3 million, partially offset by a $63.0 million decrease in net income excluding non-cash items.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S6	Working capital activity was primarily impacted by changes in accrued expense and other activity, accounts payable activity (primarily film rental liabilities) and income taxes payable during the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S7	The change in accrued expense and other activity and accounts payable activity was primarily due to the timing of film and certain other vendor payments associated with increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P58_S8	The change in income taxes payable activity during the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period was primarily associated with the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments during such periods.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres, new theatre construction, strategic partnerships, adding new screens to existing theatres, upgrading the Company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	We fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows, cash on hand, landlord contributions and proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	We intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects, with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non-maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the Company s internal rate of return targets.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	We currently expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales and landlord contributions) for theatre development, expansion, upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately $135.0 million to $145.0 million in fiscal year 2015, exclusive of acquisitions.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on March 31, 2014, the junior capital raised by DCIP in the initial financing transactions was paid in full by DCIP.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	In connection with this repayment, the Master Lease was amended to eliminate the incremental minimum rent payment provision of $2,000 per digital projection system.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	During the Fiscal 2014 Period, the Company sold a total of 500,000 shares of RealD, Inc. common stock at prices ranging from $11.27 to $12.47 per share.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	In connection with the sales, the Company received approximately $6.0 million in aggregate net proceeds (after deducting related fees and expenses) and recorded a gain on sale of approximately $2.0 million.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	During the Fiscal 2014 Period, we received approximately 0.4 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	This transaction caused a proportionate increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to 25.8 million common units.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	On a fully diluted basis, we own a 20.1% interest in NCM, Inc. as of January 1, 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	On May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Screenvision, LLC for $375 million, consisting of cash and NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Consummation of the transaction is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	On November 3, 2014, the DOJ filed an antitrust lawsuit seeking to enjoin the proposed merger between NCM, Inc. and Screenvision, LLC.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	If NCM, Inc. does not receive this approval or if the closing conditions in the agreement cannot be satisfied, NCM, Inc. may be required to pay a termination fee of approximately $28.8 million.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	National CineMedia has indemnified NCM, Inc. for the termination fee.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Accordingly, each founding member bears a pro rata portion of this fee based upon their ownership percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	As of January 1, 2015, National CineMedia did not have a liability recorded for this termination fee as it does not believe payment to be probable.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $150.5 million , $258.7 million and $183.4 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period, the Fiscal 2013 Period and the Fiscal 2012 Period, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The $108.2 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2014 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period, was primarily attributable to the impact of the $194.4 million acquisition of Hollywood Theaters during the Fiscal 2013 Period, partially offset by a $50.3 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) during the Fiscal 2014 Period and the impact of proceeds of $40.9 million related to the sale of NCM, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The $75.3 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2013 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period, was primarily attributable to the impact of the $194.4 million acquisition of Hollywood Theaters during the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $21.4 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) during the Fiscal 2013 Period, partially offset by the impact of proceeds of $40.9 million related to the sale of NCM, Inc. common stock, $5.9 million received related to the sale of RealD, Inc. common stock, and a $1.3 million decrease in cash contributions to our various investments in non-consolidated entities during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Financing Activities As described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on March 11, 2014, the Company issued the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022 in a registered public offering.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P68_S4	Total additional consideration paid in the tender offers, including the early tender premium payment, was approximately $43.4 million.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P68_S5	The tender offers were financed with a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P68_S6	As discussed further under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on April 10, 2014, the remaining 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes were fully redeemed by the Company and Regal Cinemas for an aggregate purchase price of $144.9 million (including accrued and unpaid interest) using the remaining net proceeds from 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022 and available cash on hand.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P68_S7	As a result the tender offers and the subsequent redemption, the Company recorded an aggregate $62.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P68_S8	As of January 1, 2015 , we had approximately $965.8 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Facility, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and $775.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	As of January 1, 2015 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of certain rating agencies, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the Company's current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P70_S4	An upgrade or downgrade of the Company's debt ratings, depending on the extent, could affect the cost to borrow funds.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P70_S5	There were no upgrades or downgrades to the Company's debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	During the Fiscal 2014 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.6 million in the aggregate.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	In addition, on December 15, 2014, Regal paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of its Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $156.2 million.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	We, at the discretion of the Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P71_S5	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were approximately $(332.4) million , $83.2 million and $(306.7) million for the Fiscal 2014 Period, the Fiscal 2013 Period and the Fiscal 2012 Period, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	The net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period of $415.6 million was primarily attributable to $764.3 million of cash used to repurchase our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2014 Period, the impact of $500.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 in the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $162.6 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2014 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2013 Fiscal Period, partially offset by $775.0 million in gross proceeds received in connection with the Fiscal 2014 Period issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022 and the impact of $244.3 million of cash used to repurchase a portion of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	The net increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during the Fiscal 2013 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2012 Period of $389.9 million was primarily attributable to the impact of receiving $250.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, receiving $250.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 in the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $155.1 million decrease in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2013 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2012 Fiscal Period, partially offset by the impact of $244.3 million of cash used to repurchase a portion of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes, $13.5 million of cash paid for debt acquisition costs during the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $3.1 million increase in net payments on long-term debt obligations during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") was approximately $512.7 million , $606.2 million and $549.9 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period, the Fiscal 2013 Period and the Fiscal 2012 Period, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	The decrease in EBITDA for the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to a decline in operating income as described above, the $62.4 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the refinance of approximately $711.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and Regal Cinemas' 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2014 Period and the impact of the $30.9 million gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock recorded during the Fiscal 2013 Period, partially offset by the impact of the $30.3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Fiscal 2013 Period refinance of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	The increase in EBITDA for the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above, the impact of the gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock and higher equity earnings generated by certain of our equity method investments, partially offset by the impact of the $30.3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P73_S3	The Company uses EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, for servicing our debt, paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs, prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P73_S4	We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors for these purposes as well.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	with changes in other balance sheet items (such as long-term loss accruals and deferred items).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Because EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized, which assets will often have to be replaced in the future.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Further, EBITDA, because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service, income taxes, cash dividends, capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Nonetheless, EBITDA is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	We also evaluate EBITDA because it is clear that movements in these non-GAAP measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	A reconciliation of EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows (in millions):
1168696_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Interest Rate Swaps As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as of January 1, 2015 , the Company maintained three effective hedging relationships via three distinct interest rate swap agreements (maturity dates ranging from June 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016), which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 0.817% to 1.820% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated to hedge $450.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 3.88% as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Under the terms of the Company s three effective interest rate swap agreements as of January 1, 2015 detailed below, Regal Cinemas currently receives interest at a variable rate based on the 3-month LIBOR on the first $300.0 million of aggregate borrowings under the Term Facility and receives 1-month LIBOR on the next $150.0 million of borrowings under the Term Facility.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	In addition, the Company will receive 1-month LIBOR on the next $200.0 million of borrowings under the Term Facility once the remaining interest rate swap agreement becomes effective.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P78_S4	With respect to the Company's three effective interest rate swap agreements as of January 1, 2015 , the 3-month LIBOR rate and the 1-month LIBOR rate on each respective reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three-month and one-month periods, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for the counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P80_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P80_S4	Below is a summary of the Company s current interest rate swap agreements designated as hedge agreements as of January 1, 2015 :

1168696_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	(2) Future interest payments on the Company's unhedged debt obligations as of January 1, 2015 (consisting of approximately $515.8 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the Term Facility, $775.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and approximately $11.8 million of other debt obligations) are based on the stated fixed rate or in the case of the $515.8 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the Term Facility, the current interest rate specified in our Credit Agreement as of January 1, 2015 (2.67%).
1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Future interest payments on the Company's hedged indebtedness as of January 1, 2015 (the remaining $450.0 million of borrowings under the Term Facility) are based on (1) the applicable margin (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) as of January 1, 2015 (2.50%) and (2) the expected fixed interest payments under the Company's interest rate swap agreements, which are described in further detail under Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Future interest payments are calculated based on interest rates implicit in the underlying leases, which have a weighted average interest rate of 11.24%, maturing in various installments through 2028.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S3	Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements.

1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S5	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S6	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S7	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_15_ITEM7_P88_S8	Our operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) The table does not include approximately $7.6 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized state tax benefits because the timing of the related payments was not reasonably estimable as of January 1, 2015 .

1168696_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company's effective interest rate under the Term Facility as of January 1, 2015 , would increase or decrease interest expense by $3.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company generally recognizes payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor programs as revenue in the periods in which the advertising is displayed or when the related impressions are delivered.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P19_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	During the years ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , the Company capitalized approximately $21.7 million and $22.4 million , respectively, of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	The Company also capitalizes certain direct external costs associated with software developed for internal use after the preliminary software project stage is completed and Company management has authorized further funding for a software project and it is deemed probable of completion.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company capitalizes these external software development costs only until the point at which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company records depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1168696_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	As of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , included in property and equipment is $183.2 million and $171.0 million of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $87.4 million and $73.7 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets (including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities as described further below) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company considers historical theatre level cash flows, estimated future theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, intangible asset carrying values, the age of the theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, strategic initiatives, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of whether or not a triggering event has occurred that indicates impairment of individual theatre assets may be necessary.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	For theatres where a triggering event is identified, impairment is measured based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Significant judgment is involved in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, estimating future cash flows and determining fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Triggering events identified resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $5.6 million , $9.5 million and $11.1 million for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	Certain leases for Company theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P34_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	None of our lease agreements require us to return the leased property to the lessor in its original condition (allowing for normal wear and tear) or to remove leasehold improvements at our cost.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P37_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	Historically, and for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 was approximately $320.4 million .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	As part of the Company s ongoing operations, we may close certain theatres within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the theatre or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Additionally, we generally abandon certain assets associated with a closed theatre, primarily leasehold improvements.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, goodwill associated with that business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	We evaluate whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business on the date of closure.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	Generally, on the date of closure, the closed theatre does not constitute a business because the Company retains assets and processes on that date essential to the operation of the theatre.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P49_S3	These assets and processes are significant missing elements impeding the operation of a business.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P49_S4	Accordingly, when closing individual theatres, we generally do not include goodwill in the calculation of any gain or loss on disposal of the related assets.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 indicated that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	As of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , intangible assets totaled $67.1 million before accumulated amortization of $13.2 million and $9.4 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres in fiscal 2008, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $9.9 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 13.1 years .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	During fiscal 2010, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $14.4 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 35 years , in connection with its acquisition of eight theatres acquired from AMC.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	During fiscal 2012, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $8.1 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 22 years, in connection with its acquisition of Great Escape Theatres (as described further under Note 3 "Acquisitions").
1168696_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	Finally, the Company acquired identifiable intangible assets totaling $34.4 million , related to favorable leases with a weighted average amortization period of 18 years, in connection with its acquisition of Hollywood Theaters during fiscal 2013 (see Note 3 "Acquisitions").
1168696_15_ITEM8_P53_S4	During the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , the Company recognized $3.7 million , $3.3 million and $1.1 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of January 1, 2015 is projected below (in millions):
1168696_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	During the year ended December 26, 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million pertaining to certain favorable leases associated with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended January 1, 2015 and December 27, 2012.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Other non-current assets include debt acquisition costs, which are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related agreements using a method that approximates the effective interest method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Debt acquisition costs as of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 were approximately $45.1 million and $45.3 million , before accumulated amortization of $17.1 million and $19.2 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting and has recorded the investments within "Other Non-Current Assets" in its consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company records equity in earnings and losses of these entities in its consolidated statements of income.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	As of January 1, 2015 , the Company holds a 20.1% interest in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM"), a 46.7% interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, a 50% interest in Open Road Films, a 32% interest in AC JV, LLC and a 14.6% interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition (each as described further under Note 4 "Investments").
1168696_15_ITEM8_P57_S3	In addition, the Company holds an investment in available-for-sale equity securities of RealD, Inc., an entity specializing in the licensing of 3D technologies.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P57_S4	See Note 13 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for a discussion of fair value estimation methods and assumptions with respect to the Company's investment in RealD, Inc.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P57_S5	The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities as of January 1, 2015 was approximately $288.2 million .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and RealD, Inc. and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	There was no impairment of the Company's investments during the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P61_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	Our interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P66_S3	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P66_S4	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P66_S5	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement will be amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	As of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , approximately $428.5 million and $432.2 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the ESA was recorded as components of current and non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	Generally, less than one - third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within 2 to 3 months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P69_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at the Company's theatres and earn concession or ticket awards based on the number of credits accumulated.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	Historically, and for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock And Share-Based Compensation," we apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P77_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Total comprehensive income for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 was $106.1 million , $159.5 million and $147.0 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangement, the change in fair value of available for sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments), the reclassification adjustment for gain on sale of available for sale securities recognized in net income and the change in fair value of equity method investee interest rate swap transactions during each of the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P80_S2	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P80_S3	For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	ASU 2013-02 became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 and has been applied retrospectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	The amendments in ASU 2013-11 require an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when: (1) a NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position; or (2) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice).
1168696_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	If either of these conditions exists, an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P82_S3	The amendment does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P82_S4	The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The new standard is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718).
1168696_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	ASU 2014-12 is intended to resolve the diverse accounting treatment of share-based awards that require a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P88_S3	ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	The aggregate net cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including an independent third party valuation.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S3	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S4	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_15_ITEM8_P101_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one -to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO and receipt of proceeds in excess of our investment balance, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	Accordingly, we will not provide for any additional losses as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P102_S3	Until such time, equity in earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P102_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	The modification extended the term of the exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") to 30 years , provided National CineMedia with a 5 -year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.0756 payment per patron which will increase by 8% every 5 years and starting at the end of fiscal 2011, a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which will increase by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $1,126 for fiscal 2014) and an additional payment per digital screen of $579 for fiscal 2014.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P105_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P105_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P105_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P105_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million , which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement was created to account for changes in the number of theatre screens operated by each of the joint venture partners.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	Historically, each of the joint venture partners has increased the number of screens it operates through acquisitions and newly built theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	Since the increased attendance associated with these incremental screens in turn provides for additional advertising revenues to National CineMedia, National CineMedia agreed to compensate the joint venture partners by issuing additional common membership units to the joint venture partners in consideration for their increased attendance from newly built theatres and acquisitions and overall contribution to the joint venture.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement also provides protection to National CineMedia in that the joint venture partners may be required to transfer or surrender common units to National CineMedia based on certain limited events, including declines in attendance associated with certain closed theatres and the number of screens operated.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	As a result, each joint venture partner's equity ownership interests are proportionately adjusted to reflect the risks and rewards relative to their contributions to the joint venture.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Common Unit Adjustment Agreement provides that transfers of common units are permitted solely between the joint venture partners and National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	There are no transfers of units among the joint venture partners.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P110_S2	In addition, there are no circumstances under which common units would be surrendered by the Company to National CineMedia in the event of an acquisition by one of the joint venture partners.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P110_S3	However, adjustments to the common units owned by one of the joint venture partners will result in an adjustment to the Company's equity ownership interest percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P111_S3	If the Company elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Additional Investments Tranche at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for the Additional Investments Tranche common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a non-operating gain or loss.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through January 1, 2015 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 11.2 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 2-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P176_S1	In addition, the Company will receive 1-month LIBOR on the next $200.0 million of borrowings under the Term Facility once the remaining interest rate swap agreement becomes effective.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P176_S2	With respect to the Company's three effective interest rate swap agreements as of January 1, 2015 , the 3-month LIBOR rate and the 1-month LIBOR rate on each respective reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three-month and one-month periods, respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	The interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar month or calendar quarter, as applicable, until expiration.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P177_S1	At such dates, the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P178_S0	No premium or discount was incurred upon the Company entering into the interest rate swaps, because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for the counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P178_S1	The interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and the ineffective portion reported in earnings (interest expense).
1168696_15_ITEM8_P178_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P178_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P190_S1	The minimum rentals for these operating leases are included in the table above.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	In December 1995, United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ("UATC") entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby 31 owned properties were sold to and leased back from an unaffiliated third party.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	In conjunction with the transaction, the buyer of the properties issued publicly traded pass-through certificates.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P191_S2	In connection with this sale and leaseback transaction, UATC entered into a Participation Agreement that requires UATC to comply with various covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, guarantees, issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries and subsidiary distributions, transfer of assets and payment of dividends.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	During the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , a current tax benefit of $1.6 million , $1.3 million and $1.3 million , respectively, was allocated directly to stockholders' equity for compensation expense for tax purposes in excess of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes as reported and the amount computed by multiplying the income before taxes and extraordinary item by the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% was as follows (in millions):
1168696_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax asset consisted of the following at (in millions):
1168696_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	At January 1, 2015 , the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $119.1 million with expiration commencing in 2016.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P196_S1	The Company's net operating loss carryforwards were generated by the entities of United Artists, Edwards and Hollywood Theaters.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an "ownership change" of a corporation.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize the net operating losses acquired from United Artists, Edwards and Hollywood Theaters may be impaired as a result of the "ownership change" limitations.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P197_S2	The Company s state net operating losses may be carried forward for various periods, between seven and 20 years , with the last expiring year being 2024.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P197_S3	The Company also has net operating losses in U.S. territorial jurisdictions with expirations commencing in 2019.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	In assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P198_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P198_S2	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $34.8 million and $34.1 million as of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , respectively, as management believes it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in future tax periods.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P198_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P198_S4	During the year ended January 1, 2015 , the valuation allowance was increased by $0.6 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created during the year ended January 1, 2015 would not be realized and was increased by $0.1 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created in prior years would not be realized.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	Effective December 29, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P199_S1	A reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 was as follows (in millions):
1168696_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $0.4 million and $2.6 million within the next twelve months primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 was $7.1 million .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 was approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P202_S1	As of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , the Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of approximately $2.0 million and $1.8 million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P202_S2	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of income for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 was $0.2 million , $0.0 million and $(2.0) million , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries collectively file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and U.S. territory jurisdictions.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P203_S1	The Company is not subject to U.S. federal or, with limited exceptions, state examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010, and is not subject to U.S. Territory examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P203_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	In May 2014, the Company was notified that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") would examine its 2012 federal income tax return.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	In January 2015, the Company was notified that the IRS would examine its 2010 federal income tax return.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	Management believes that it has provided adequate provision for income taxes relative to the tax years under examination.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	The Company is presently involved in various judicial, administrative, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business operations, including but not limited to, personal injury claims, landlord-tenant disputes, tax disputes, employment and other contractual matters, some of which are described below.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P206_S2	The Company's theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	On October 9, 2012, staff at the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Board (the "Regional Board") notified United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ( UATC ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that the Regional Board was contemplating issuing a cleanup and abatement order to UATC with respect to a property in Santa Clara, California that UATC owned and then leased during the 1960s and 1970s.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P207_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Regional Board issued a tentative order to UATC setting out proposed site clean-up requirements for UATC with respect to the property.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P207_S2	According to the Regional Board, the property in question has been contaminated by dry-cleaning facilities that operated at the property in question from approximately 1961 until 1996.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P207_S3	The Regional Board also issued a tentative order to the current property owner, who has been conducting site investigation and remediation activities at the site for several years.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P207_S4	UATC submitted comments to the Regional Board on July 28, 2013, objecting to the tentative order.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P207_S5	The Regional Board considered the matter at its regular meeting on September 11, 2013 and adopted the tentative order with only minor changes.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	On October 11, 2013, UATC filed a petition with the State Water Resources Control Board ( State Board ) for review of the Regional Board s order.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P208_S1	The State Board has not yet acted on the petition.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P208_S2	UATC is cooperating with the Regional Board while its petition remains pending before the State Board.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P208_S3	UATC intends to vigorously defend this matter.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P208_S4	We believe that we are, and were during the period in question described in this paragraph, in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	On June 17, 2014, Starlight Cinemas, Inc. (the "Plaintiff") filed a complaint and demand for jury trial in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Central District against Regal alleging various violations by Regal of California antitrust and unfair competition laws and common law.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	On July 14, 2014, Regal removed the action to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P209_S2	The Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that Regal has adversely affected the Plaintiff s ability to exhibit first-run, feature-length motion pictures at its Corona, California theatre.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P209_S3	The Plaintiff is seeking, among other things, compensatory, treble and punitive damages and equitable relief enjoining Regal from engaging in future anticompetitive conduct.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	Regal filed a motion to dismiss all claims.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P210_S1	The United States District Court for the Central District of California granted the motion on October 23, 2014.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P210_S2	Plaintiff's subsequent attempts to file an amended complaint were struck and denied.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	On February 5, 2015, the Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P211_S1	Management believes that the allegations and claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the Plaintiff's claims if the Plaintiff pursues the case.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	On July 10, 2014, the State of New York approved a sales tax refund claim filed by the Company to recover sales taxes paid on certain nontaxable purchases made by the Company during the fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012 periods.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P212_S1	The refund totaled approximately $17.4 million , including interest.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P212_S2	The Company recorded the refund by reducing "Other operating expenses" by approximately $16.8 million and "Interest expense, net" by approximately $0.6 million .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	As discussed in Note 4 "Investments," on May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Screenvision, LLC for $375 million , consisting of cash and NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	Consummation of the transaction is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	O n November 3, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") filed an antitrust lawsuit seeking to enjoin the proposed merger between NCM, Inc. and Screenvision, LLC.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	If NCM, Inc. does not receive this approval or if the closing conditions in the agreement cannot be satisfied, NCM, Inc. may be required to pay a termination fee of approximately $28.8 million .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P215_S2	National CineMedia has indemnified NCM, Inc. for the termination fee.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P215_S3	Accordingly, each founding member bears a pro rata portion of this fee based upon their ownership percentage in National CineMedia.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P215_S4	The Company holds an investment in National CineMedia of 20.1% as of January 1, 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P215_S5	As of January 1, 2015, National CineMedia did not have a liability recorded for this termination fee as it does not believe payment to be probable.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	In situations where management believes that a loss arising from proceedings described herein is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no amount within the range is more probable than another.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S1	As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these proceedings is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S2	The amounts reserved for such proceedings totaled approximately $2.8 million (primarily landlord-tenant disputes) as of January 1, 2015.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S3	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S4	Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Company believes the risk of loss is more than slight.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S5	Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for cases described herein in which damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal issues presented.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P216_S6	However, for these cases, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the Company s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P217_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P217_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P217_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P218_S0	In prior years, private litigants and the DOJ had filed claims against the Company alleging that a number of theatres with stadium seating violated the ADA because these theatres allegedly failed to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with lines of sight comparable to those available to other members of the general public and denied persons in wheelchairs access to the stadium portion of the theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P218_S1	On June 8, 2005, Regal reached an agreement with the DOJ resolving and dismissing the private litigants claims and all claims made by the United States under the ADA.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P218_S2	On December 9, 2010, the parties renewed the Consent Decree for another three year term.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P218_S3	On or about February 5, 2014 the Company filed its final compliance report and fulfilled all of its obligations under the Consent Decree.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	From time to time, the Company receives claims that the stadium seating offered by theatres allegedly violates the ADA.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P219_S1	In these instances, the Company seeks to resolve or dismiss these claims based on the terms of the DOJ settlement or under applicable ADA standards.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P220_S0	The accessibility of theatres to persons with visual impairments or that are deaf or hard of hearing remains a topic of interest to the DOJ and they have published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the provision of closed captioning and descriptive audio within the theatre environment.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P220_S1	The Company believes it provides the members of the visually and hearing impaired communities with reasonable access to the movie-going experience, and has deployed new digital captioning and descriptive video systems that should meet all such potential requirements or expectations of any federal, state or individual concerns.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P220_S2	The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P220_S3	The Company intends to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth above, does not currently anticipate that compliance will require the Company to expend substantial funds.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P221_S0	Under each of the employment contracts, the Company must indemnify each executive from and against all liabilities with respect to such executive's service as an officer, and as a director, to the extent applicable.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P221_S1	In addition, under the employment contracts, each executive is entitled to severance payments in connection with the termination by the Company of the executive without cause, the termination by the executive for good reason, or the termination of the executive, under circumstances in connection with a change in control of the Company (as defined within each employment contract).

1168696_15_ITEM8_P271_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P272_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P272_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P273_S0	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, or vesting of restricted stock and performance share units.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P273_S1	The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock and performance share units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P273_S2	In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P274_S0	The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P274_S1	The earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P274_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P274_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P275_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share and per share data):
1168696_15_ITEM8_P276_S0	Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P276_S1	The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P277_S0	The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P277_S1	Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:
1168696_15_ITEM8_P278_S0	Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P278_S1	Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P278_S2	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P279_S0	The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 1, 2015 :
1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) The Company maintains an investment in RealD, Inc., an entity specializing in the licensing of 3D technologies.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S2	The fair value of the RealD, Inc. shares is determined using RealD, Inc.'s publicly traded common stock price, which falls under Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S3	The held shares of RealD, Inc. stock are accounted for as available-for-sale equity securities and recurring fair value adjustments to these shares are recorded to "Other Non-Current Assets" with a corresponding entry to "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" on a quarterly basis.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S4	During the quarter ended June 27, 2013, the Company sold 400,000 shares of RealD, Inc. common stock at prices ranging from $14.61 to $15.42 per share.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S8	During the year ended January 1, 2015, the Company recorded a net decrease to its investment in RealD, Inc. of approximately $3.2 million and a corresponding net increase to "Accumulated other comprehensive income, net" of $0.5 million , net of tax.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S9	The fair value of the remaining 322,780 RealD, Inc. common shares was $3.8 million , based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of January 1, 2015 of $11.80 per share.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P280_S10	(2) The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations" is based on Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P281_S0	The counterparties to the Company's interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P281_S1	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P281_S2	These interest rate swaps exhibited no ineffectiveness during the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 and accordingly, the net gain on the swaps, net of tax, of $1.1 million , $2.3 million and $2.8 million , respectively, were reported as a component of other comprehensive income for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P282_S0	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P282_S1	There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P283_S0	In addition, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P283_S1	The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument are as follows:
1168696_15_ITEM8_P284_S0	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
1168696_15_ITEM8_P285_S0	The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P286_S0	As further described in Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the Company regularly reviews long-lived assets (primarily property and equipment), intangible assets and investments in non-consolidated entities, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P286_S1	When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P287_S0	The Company s analysis relative to long-lived assets resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $5.6 million , $9.5 million and $11.1 million for the years ended January 1, 2015 , December 26, 2013 and December 27, 2012 , respectively.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P287_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P288_S0	In addition, during the year ended December 26, 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million pertaining to certain favorable leases associated with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.

1168696_15_ITEM8_P291_S0	The fair value of the Amended Senior Credit Facility described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations," which consists of the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility, is estimated based on quoted prices (Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) as of January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 .
1168696_15_ITEM8_P291_S1	The associated interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and are assumed to approximate fair value.
1168696_15_ITEM8_P291_S2	The fair values of the 53/4% Senior Notes Due 2022, the 53/4% Senior Notes Due 2025, and the 53/4% Senior Notes Due 2023 are estimated based on quoted prices (Level 1 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) for these issuances as of January 1, 2015 and, for the 91/8% Senior Notes, the 85/8% Senior Notes, the 53/4% Senior Notes Due 2025 and the 53/4% Senior Notes Due 2023, December 26, 2013 .

1168696_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 7,361 screens in 572 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2015 , with approximately 217 million attendees for the year ended December 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2015 ").
1168696_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	We operate multi-screen theatres and, as of December 31, 2015 , had an average of 12.9 screens per location, which is well above the North American motion picture exhibition industry average.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	For fiscal 2014 and prior periods, the Company's fiscal year ended on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) resulted in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Beginning January 2, 2015, the Company's fiscal year changed from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25 of each year to a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	Accordingly, effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, the Company s quarterly results will be for three month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	For fiscal 2015 , we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $3,127.3 million , $319.3 million and $153.4 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S4	In addition, we generated $434.4 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S5	Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to allocate capital effectively to enhance value for our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S6	This strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by distributing value to our stockholders, capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S7	Our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatre assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P4_S8	Key elements of our business strategy include:
1168696_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 31, 2015 , we have returned approximately $4.1 billion to our stockholders in the form of quarterly and extraordinary cash dividends.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Pursuing Prudent Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	For example, since 2012, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance our asset base, operating results and free cash flow through the successful acquisition of 73 theatres and 875 screens, including the fiscal 2015 acquisition of five theatres with 61 screens from entities affiliated with Georgia Theatre Company.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	With respect to partnership initiatives, we own approximately 19.5% of National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM") as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America and concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC"), and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also participate in other joint ventures such as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, Open Road Films and AC JV, LLC, which are also further discussed under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K. Finally, the Company is a party to a joint venture with certain exhibitors and distributors called Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition ("DCDC").
1168696_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	DCDC has established a satellite distribution network that distributes digital content to theatres via satellite.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe our investment in National CineMedia and other joint venture arrangements generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	We continue to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts:
1168696_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	First, we continue to focus on improving customer amenities, primarily the installation of luxury reclining seats.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of December 31, 2015 , we offered luxury reclining seating in 819 auditoriums at 72 theatre locations .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	Based on promising results, we expect to offer luxury reclining seating in approximately 40 additional locations during fiscal 2016 and expect to outfit approximately 25% to 30% of the total screens in our circuit with luxury reclining seating by the end of fiscal 2017.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by contributions from our theatre landlords.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Second, to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we offered an expanded menu of food and/or alcoholic beverage items in 235 locations and during fiscal 2016, we expect to introduce an expanded menu of food in approximately 65 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 75 locations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Third, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had over 13 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry, and these members accounted for approximately $1.1 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P12_S3	In addition, our mobile ticketing application, designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 4.2 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P12_S4	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal (including Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions) and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Finally, we believe that our IMAX digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , our IMAX footprint consisted of 89 IMAX screens and we operated 91 RPX SM screens.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We have been encouraged by the operating results of our IMAX and RPX SM screens and believe such premium motion picture formats allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe this strategy will enable us to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Pursuing Selective Growth Opportunities and Active Asset Management.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction, expansion and upgrades that meet our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	Additionally, we manage our asset base by opportunistically closing underperforming theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P14_S4	We continued to actively manage our asset base during fiscal 2015 by opening two theatres with 24 screens and closing nine underperforming theatres with 91 screens, ending the year with 572 theatres and 7,361 screens.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P14_S5	In summary, we believe our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatres assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities: Industry Leader.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We are the largest domestic motion picture exhibitor operating 7,361 screens in 572 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S5	Our operating philosophy focuses on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S6	At the corporate level, we are able to capitalize on our size and operational expertise to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P16_S7	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of financial data analysis, detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Since our 2002 IPO, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of nine theatre circuits, consisting of 230 theatres and 2,683 screens.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	We have generally achieved immediate cost savings at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S4	In addition, approximately 53% of our locations featured one or more premium amenity offerings as of December 31, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S5	We believe the continued rollout of premium amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and alcoholic beverage offerings and IMAX and RPX SM screens allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for a majority of our customers.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P18_S6	Finally, we believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Dividend Policy We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	To that end, during fiscal 2015 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $139.1 million in the aggregate.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	Further, on February 9, 2016 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2016 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2016 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S6	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P19_S7	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our Board of Directors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and stable attendance.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5% with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues and stable attendance, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and in turn box office revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	Consequently, we expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P20_S4	However, we believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the domestic motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P20_S5	For example, during the most recent five-year period, attendance levels remained stable and the industry generated record box office results during 2012, 2013 and 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Through the years, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering content to consumers including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its release in the next distribution channel has contracted slightly to approximately three to four months.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S4	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S5	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S6	Finally, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of implementing various initiatives, concepts and customer amenities aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S7	These initiatives include luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service, reserved seating, the enhancement of loyalty programs and other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S8	In addition, we believe the benefits associated with premium motion picture formats are significant for our industry and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue from formats such as IMAX and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S9	Finally, we believe that operating a digital theatre circuit provides greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which has enhanced our capacity utilization, and enables us to generate incremental revenue from advanced motion picture formats, such as digital 3D, and the exhibition of specialty content offerings through certain distributors of specialty content, such as AC JV, LLC.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P22_S10	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	THEATRE OPERATIONS We operate the largest theatre circuit in the United States with 7,361 screens in 572 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	We operate theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas, which include locations in suburban growth areas.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S5	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S6	In addition, many of our theatres feature state-of-the-art amenities such as immersive sound, wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling screens, Sony Digital Cinema TM 4K projection systems, 3D digital projection systems, IMAX and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM , digital stereo surround-sound, closed-captioning, multi-station concessions stands, computerized ticketing systems, plush stadium seating with cup holders and retractable armrests and enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S7	Finally, we are in the process of implementing various other initiatives, concepts and customer amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service and reserved seating.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P23_S8	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	In addition, we realize significant operating efficiencies by having common box office, concessions, projection, lobby and restroom facilities, which enables us to spread some of our costs, such as payroll, advertising, rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	We strategically schedule movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and box office and concession line congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, e-gift cards and mobile and internet ticketing.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons and believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2015 :
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We have implemented a best practices management program across all of our theatres, including daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management reports generated for each individual theatre and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S4	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S5	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities and monitor food service.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S6	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers and various contractual service partners regularly inspect each theatre and provide recurring feedback.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S7	In addition, we consistently solicit feedback from our patrons through an on-line guest experience program whereby our guests rank and provide detailed comments and experiences for each of our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P27_S8	Finally, we also conduct a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing over 20,400 U.S. theatre screens (of which approximately 19,800 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	During 2015, over 700 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which National CineMedia currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	As described further in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), which serves as the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an IPO of its common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	In connection with the IPO of NCM, Inc., RCM, through its wholly owned subsidiary Regal CineMedia Holdings, LLC ("RCH"), AMC and Cinemark amended and restated the operating agreement of National CineMedia and other ancillary agreements.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	As a result of these agreements, we receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	Subsequent to the IPO of NCM, Inc. and through December 31, 2015 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 11.8 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P30_S4	These transactions, partially offset by the redemption of approximately 6.6 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which we sold in underwritten public offerings during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, caused a net increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to 26.4 million common units.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P30_S5	As a result, on a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.5% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	During fiscal 2013, National CineMedia sold its "Fathom Events" business to AC JV, LLC ( AC JV ), a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company owned 32% by each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark and 4% by National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Fathom Events business focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to various theatre operators (including us, AMC and Cinemark) to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule and includes events such as live and pre-recorded concerts, opera and symphony, DVD product releases and marketing events, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, live sporting events and other special events.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	In consideration for the sale, National CineMedia received a total of $25 million in promissory notes from RCI, Cinemark and AMC (one-third or approximately $8.3 million from each).
1168696_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	In addition, RCI, AMC and Cinemark each amended and restated its existing exhibitor service agreement with National CineMedia in connection with the sale by National CineMedia of its Fathom Events business.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions, including AC JV.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	We maintain an investment in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	DCIP funds the cost of digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	DCIP s initial and second round of financing substantially covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	effected equity contributions of approximately $7.5 million to DCIP since fiscal 2012, and expects to make additional equity contributions in the future.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	Through fiscal 2015, the Company has received $8.3 million in cash distributions from DCIP as a return on its investment.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , all of our screens were fully outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	OPEN ROAD FILMS JOINT VENTURE We also maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Open Road Films was created to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	Open Road Films distributed six films during 2015 which generated national box office revenues of approximately $70.2 million, and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P38_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we have invested $20.0 million in cash in Open Road Films and may invest an additional $10.0 million in this joint venture.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P38_S4	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of December 31, 2015 was $(10.0) million.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P38_S5	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Open Road Films.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	FILM DISTRIBUTION Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	A strong theatrical opening often establishes a film's success and positively influences the film's potential in these downstream distribution channels.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P43_S6	In zones where there is competition, a distributor may allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	The majority of our arrangements use a "sliding scale" formula.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	To a much lesser extent, we have also used a "firm term" formula and a "review or settlement" method where either (1) the exhibitor and distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor or (2) the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	For fiscal 2015 , films shown from our top ten film distributors accounted for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor's motion pictures in any given year.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	In 2015, our largest single distributor accounted for 22.4% of our box office admissions.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	CONCESSIONS In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 28.8% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S4	To continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S5	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S6	As of December 31, 2015 , we offered an expanded menu of food and/or alcoholic beverage items in 235 locations and during fiscal 2016, we expect to introduce an expanded menu of food in approximately 65 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 75 locations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P50_S7	We believe that offering a wider array of food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	COMPETITION The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	We have several hundred competitors nationwide that vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	Our competitors, including newly established motion picture exhibitors, may build new theatres or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P52_S4	If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P52_S5	As the largest motion picture exhibitor, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	As discussed in "Industry Overview and Trends" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of experimenting with various initiatives and concepts aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given fiscal period.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	Other technologies could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	Over the past several years, the theatrical release window has contracted to approximately three to four months.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P54_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P54_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P54_S4	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P54_S5	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	MARKETING AND ADVERTISING Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	To market our theatres, we utilize Internet, mobile and social media, print and multimedia advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	In many of our markets, we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our frequent moviegoer loyalty program, Regal Crown Club , is designed to actively engage our core customers and is the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S4	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S5	Through the Regal Crown Club , we seek to enhance the customer experience and increase frequency of purchases to generate additional revenue.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S6	As of December 31, 2015 , we had over 13 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , and these members accounted for approximately $1.1 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P55_S7	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series, cross-promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our mobile ticketing application, designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 4.2 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Information Technology ("IT") is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our theatres, the management of our business and other revenue-generating opportunities.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery and warehouse stores and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	We continue to expand our ability to sell tickets remotely by using our internet ticketing partners, and by offering self-service alternatives, such as ticketing kiosks, print-at-home ticketing, and mobile ticketing.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S3	Our Apple iPhone or Android phone application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, special offers from Regal and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S4	We continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve services to our patrons and provide information to our management, allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S5	In addition, our scheduling systems support the coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S6	The scheduling systems also provide information electronically and automatically to the media outlets, including newspapers and various online media outlets to drive attendance to our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P58_S7	The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as being the primary source of data for our financial systems.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	SEASONALITY Our revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 25,915 persons.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Shown below are the names, ages as of December 31, 2015 , and current positions of our executive officers.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	There are no family relationships between any of the persons listed below, or between any of such persons and any of the directors of the Company or any persons nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer of the Company.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Amy E. Miles is our Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Directors.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	Ms. Miles has served as Chief Executive Officer since June 2009 and became Chair of the Board of Directors in March 2015.

1168696_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	REGULATION The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
1168696_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
1168696_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	For fiscal 2015 , our total rent expense and net interest expense were approximately $421.5 million and $129.6 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we had total debt obligations of $2,342.4 million .
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,244.6 million .
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	For a detailed discussion of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments over the next several years, refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments" provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S6	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S7	As a result, the inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S8	The agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other debt instruments.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S11	In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our and our subsidiaries' cash flows prove inadequate to meet our and their debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our and our subsidiaries' existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets, to obtain additional financing or suspend the payment of dividends.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which can depend on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with the top ten film distributors accounting for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S7	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce our revenue.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels during the theatrical release window.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The average theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months over the last decade.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We can provide no assurance as to the impact or timing of any material contraction to the current theatrical release window.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry has and continues to implement various initiatives, concepts, customer amenities and technological innovations aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its patrons (including, but not limited to, luxury reclining seating, enhancement of food and alcoholic beverage offerings, the installation of premium format screens, digital 3D, satellite distribution technologies and stadium seating).
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Theatres in our markets without these amenities may be more vulnerable to competition than those theatres with such amenities, and should other theatre operators choose to implement these or other initiatives in these markets, the performance of our theatres may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, while we continue to implement these and other initiatives, new innovations and technology will continue to impact our industry.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to respond to or invest in future technology and the changing preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could also adversely affect our results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Finally, should other theatre operators return to the aggressive capital spending strategies undertaken in the late 1990's, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We are currently the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and Attorneys General in several states and have been named as defendants in third party lawsuits related to similar matters.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are currently the subject of an investigation by the DOJ regarding potentially anticompetitive conduct and coordination among NCM, AMC, the Company and/or Cinemark, under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, we are the subject of investigations by various state attorneys general relating to our investments in various joint ventures, including NCM, as well as movie clearances whereby film distributors do not license the rights to exhibitors to play the same first-run feature length films at the same time in the same theatrical release zones.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, we have been named as defendants in lawsuits commenced by other theatre operators who claim the Company has engaged in anti-competitive conduct by virtue of these clearances.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The Company intends to cooperate with any Federal or state investigations to the extent any are undertaken.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	other state or Federal governmental reviews of the Company s conduct, or any third party lawsuits initiated regarding the same or similar matters.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we are subject to an adverse finding or ruling resulting from any of these investigations or lawsuits, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, we have already incurred substantial legal expenses related to these matters and we may incur significant additional expenditures in the future.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Furthermore, the period of time necessary to fully respond to and resolve these investigations and lawsuits is uncertain and could require significant management time and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We may not benefit from our acquisition strategy and strategic partnerships.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In the case of acquisitions, even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S9	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S10	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S11	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S12	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S13	If we cannot generate anticipated cash flows resulting from acquisitions or fail to realize their anticipated benefits, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P10_S14	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We also selectively pursue theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we own approximately 19.5% of National CineMedia, and participate in other joint ventures such as DCIP, Open Road Films, AC JV and DCDC.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, Open Road Films, AC JV and DCDC or other existing or future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or state or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities, pay damages and fines, or otherwise modify our normal operations as a result of our joint venture investments.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	our investments in our various joint ventures, including NCM, for potentially anticompetitive conduct, as described more fully herein, and until such investigations are complete, we are not able to predict their outcome.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses, power outages and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to protect confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Economic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If economic conditions are weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Theatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe storms in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	For example, our future ability to borrow on Regal Cinemas' senior credit facility or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S8	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S11	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S12	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S13	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S14	We are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S15	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P16_S16	Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part time workers who are paid at or slightly above the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our theatres must comply with the ADA to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Anschutz Corporation owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As a result, as of December 31, 2015 , The Anschutz Corporation controlled approximately 78% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	For as long as The Anschutz Corporation continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors, effect stockholder actions by written consent in lieu of stockholder meetings and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	The Anschutz Corporation will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to The Anschutz Corporation but not to other stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, The Anschutz Corporation and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that open-market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P21_S10	Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, including by the The Anschutz Corporation or its affiliates, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As of February 22, 2016 , we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, The Anschutz Corporation and its affiliates are able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted and may chose to do so at any time.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, we cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by The Anschutz Corporation or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders (unless otherwise required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S10	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P22_S11	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We are a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries, or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and are subject to various business considerations.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2023 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2025 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_16_ITEM1A_P24_S6	In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 to 20 years.
1168696_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_16_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that these facilities are currently adequate for our operations.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 22, 2016 , there were approximately 244 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and one stockholder of record of our Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of February 22, 2016 our officers, directors and key employees hold, or in the case of performance shares are eligible to receive, approximately 1,499,394 restricted shares of our Class A common stock, for which the restrictions lapse or the performance criteria and vesting may be satisfied, at various dates through January 13, 2020.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	All shares of restricted stock are registered and will be freely tradable when the restrictions lapse, unless such shares are issued to or acquired by an affiliate of Regal, in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividend Policy During fiscal 2015 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $139.1 million in the aggregate.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	During fiscal 2014, we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.6 million in the aggregate.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	In addition, on December 15, 2014, we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of $1.00 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $156.2 million.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	Finally, on February 9, 2016 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S4	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2016 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2016 .
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S5	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S6	We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S7	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P2_S8	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None.
1168696_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company withheld approximately 1,269 shares of restricted stock at an aggregate cost of less than $0.1 million as permitted by the applicable equity award agreements, to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of restricted stock awards.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (2) Includes the December 15, 2014 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	(3) Includes the December 27, 2012 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P0_S2	(4) During the quarter ended September 26, 2013, we redeemed 2.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which the Company sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $17.79 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by approximately $10.0 million , the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P0_S3	The Company received approximately $40.9 million in proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $30.9 million .
1168696_16_ITEM6_P0_S4	We accounted for these transactions as a proportionate decrease in the Company's Initial Investment Tranche and Additional Investments Tranche and decreased our ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P0_S5	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	(5) During the years ended December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015, December 26, 2013, December 27, 2012, and December 29, 2011, and December 30, 2010, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $15.6 million, $5.6 million, $9.5 million, $11.1 million, and $17.9 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P1_S2	(6) During the quarter ended December 29, 2011, the Company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in RealD, Inc. as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other-than-temporary impairment existed as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P1_S3	Such determination was based primarily on the length (approximately six months) of time during which the fair value of the RealD, Inc. investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately $19.40 per share, the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	RealD, Inc. to fair value as of December 29, 2011.
1168696_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	The fair value of RealD, Inc. common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. as of December 29, 2011 of $8.05 per share.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview and Basis of Presentation We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the United States, consisting of 7,361 screens in 572 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	We also maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which concentrates on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and discount ticket programs, various other activities in our theatres and our relationship with National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to maximize our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company's revenues are usually seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Generally, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	The emergence or continuance of a "hit" film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P3_S6	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	We evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions, which include those related to property and equipment, goodwill, deferred revenue pertaining to gift card and discount ticket sales, income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P7_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firms.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an estimated useful life of 30 years.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life, and their depreciable lives (10-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolete, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S8	Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S9	Historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S10	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S11	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P12_S12	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 , consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $216.8 million , representing 6.9% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $15.7 million, or 7.2%.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P17_S8	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	For fiscal 2015 , our provision for income taxes was $100.1 million .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained, the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 39.5% to 40.5% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $2.5 million.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	As noted in our significant accounting policies for "Revenue Recognition" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to cash received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company recognizes revenue as a component of "Other operating revenues" associated with discount tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience, when the likelihood of redemption is remote, and when there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card and discount ticket items to the relevant jurisdiction.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of historical redemption trends and considers various factors including the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Significant Events and Fiscal 2016 Outlook During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (" Fiscal 2015 Period "), the fifty-three week fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 (" Fiscal 2014 Period ") and the fiscal year ended December 26, 2013 (" Fiscal 2013 Period "), the Company entered into various investing and financing transactions which are more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During the Fiscal 2015 Period, we continued to make progress with respect to our business strategy as follows:
1168696_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	We demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	During the Fiscal 2015 Period , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share, or approximately $ 139.1 million in the aggregate.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	with 24 screens and closing nine underperforming theatres with 91 screens, ending the Fiscal 2015 Period with 572 theatres and 7,361 screens.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	We continued to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts:
1168696_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	First, we continued to focus on improving customer amenities, primarily the installation of luxury reclining seats.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of December 31, 2015 , we offered luxury reclining seating in 819 auditoriums at 72 theatre locations .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	Based on promising results, we expect to offer luxury reclining seating in approximately 40 additional locations during fiscal 2016 and expect to outfit approximately 25% to 30% of the total screens in our circuit with luxury reclining seating by the end of fiscal 2017.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by contributions from our theatre landlords.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Second, to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have focused on expanding our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	We believe that the enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we offered an expanded menu of food and/or alcoholic beverage items in 235 locations and during fiscal 2016, we expect to introduce an expanded menu of food in approximately 65 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 75 locations.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Third, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	Regal Crown Club members are eligible for specified awards, such as concession items, based on purchases made at our participating theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had over 13 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry, and these members accounted for approximately $1.1 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	In addition, our mobile ticketing application, designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 4.2 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal (including Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions) and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Finally, we believe that our IMAX digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , our IMAX footprint consisted of 89 IMAX screens and we operated 91 RPX SM screens.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	We have been encouraged by the operating results of our IMAX and RPX SM screens and believe such premium motion picture formats allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	We are optimistic regarding the breadth of the 2016 film slate, including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	Evidenced by the motion picture studios' continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases, 2016 appears to be another year of high-profile releases such as Zootopia, Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Jungle Book, Captain America: Civil War, Alice Through the Looking Glass, X Men: Apocalypse, Warcraft, Finding Dory, Independence Day: Resurgence, Ghostbusters, Ice Age: Collision Course, Star Trek Beyond, Jason Bourne, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	We intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	With respect to capital expenditures, subject to the timing of certain construction projects, we expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales and landlord contributions) to be in the range of $135.0 million to $150.0 million for fiscal 2016 , consisting of new theatre development, expansion of existing theatre facilities, upgrades for premium amenities, and maintenance.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Overall for the fiscal 2016 year, we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	In addition, we expect fiscal 2016 admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	We will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities, selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Recent Developments On February 9, 2016 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2016 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2016 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Results of Operations Based on our review of industry sources, North American box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to the Fiscal 2015 Period were estimated to have increased by approximately three to four percent in comparison to the period of time that corresponds to the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	The industry's box office results for 2015 were positively impacted by strong attendance from the breadth and commercial success of the overall film slate during 2015, including, most notably, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Jurassic World .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	For fiscal 2014 and prior periods, the Company's fiscal year ended on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) resulted in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Beginning January 2, 2015, the Company's fiscal year changed from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25 of each year to a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	Accordingly, effective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, the Company s quarterly results will be for three month periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items included in our consolidated statements of income for the Fiscal 2015 Period, the Fiscal 2014 Period and the Fiscal 2013 Period (dollars and attendance in millions, except average ticket prices and average concessions per patron):
1168696_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ * Not meaningful (1) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	(2) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of concessions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	(3) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of total revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Compared to Fiscal 2014 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2015 Period, total admissions revenues increased $39.3 million , or 2.0% , to $2,038.2 million , from $1,998.9 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	A 3.6% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $71.3 million of total admissions revenues), partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in attendance (approximately $32.0 million of total admissions revenues) led to the overall increase in the Fiscal 2015 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	For the Fiscal 2015 Period, the 3.6% average ticket price increase was due to selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews and an increase in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium format films exhibited during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	The decrease in attendance during the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily related to the timing of our fiscal calendar.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	The Fiscal 2014 Period included seven additional days of operations in comparison to that of the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	The seven days of operations were significant in that they accounted for approximately 9.1 million attendees, or 4.1%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total attendance and contributed approximately $80.1 million, or 4.0%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S6	Notwithstanding the timing of our fiscal calendar, the Company's box office results for 2015 were positively impacted by strong attendance from the breadth and commercial success of the overall film slate during 2015 including, most notably, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Jurassic World .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S7	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the increase in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was in line with the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S8	We are optimistic that the industry's investment in new theatres and customer amenities and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P36_S9	To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given quarter.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Concessions Total concessions revenues increased $72.1 million , or 8.7% , to $901.7 million during the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $829.6 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	A 10.3% increase in average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $85.4 million of total concessions revenues), partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in attendance (approximately $13.3 million of total concessions revenues) led to the overall increase in the Fiscal 2015 Period concessions revenue.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	The decrease in attendance during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily related to the timing of our fiscal calendar described above.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	Attendance for the seven additional days of operations during the Fiscal 2014 Period contributed approximately $32.1 million, or 3.9%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total concessions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	The increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume, selective price increases and the continued rollout of our expanded food and alcohol menu.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	Other Operating Revenues Other operating revenues increased $25.8 million , or 16.0% , to $187.4 million during the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $161.6 million for the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S6	Included in other operating revenues are the theatre access fees paid by National CineMedia (net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire), revenues from our vendor marketing programs, other theatre revenues (consisting of theatre rentals, internet ticketing surcharges, arcade games and other) and revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P37_S7	During the Fiscal 2015 Period, the increase in other operating revenues was due to an increase in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs (approximately $10.2 million), an increase in other theatre revenues (approximately $8.1 million) primarily related to internet ticketing surcharges, an increase in revenues from our vendor marketing programs (approximately $3.8 million) and incremental National CineMedia revenues (approximately $3.6 million).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Film Rental and Advertising Costs Film rental and advertising costs as a percentage of admissions revenues for the Fiscal 2015 Period increased to 53.6% during the Fiscal 2015 Period from 52.4% in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	percentage of box office revenues during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable to higher film costs associated with the success of the top tier films exhibited during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Cost of Concessions During the Fiscal 2015 Period, cost of concessions increased $3.3 million , or 3.0% , to $114.4 million as compared to $111.1 million during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2015 Period was approximately 12.7% , compared to 13.4% during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	The decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily due to the amount of vendor marketing revenues recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions and the impact of the aforementioned price increases during such periods, partially offset by slightly higher raw material and packaged good costs for certain items and the related mix of concession products sold.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	Rent Expense Rent expense decreased $1.9 million , or 0.4% , to $421.5 million in the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $423.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	The decrease in rent expense in the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily impacted by the restructuring of an existing master lease covering nine operating properties described further in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and the closure of nine theatres with 91 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2014 Period, partially offset by incremental rent associated with the opening of two new theatres with 24 screens and the acquisition of five theatres and 61 screens subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S6	Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $50.5 million , or 6.2% , to $863.7 million in the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $813.2 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S7	During the Fiscal 2015 Period, the increase in other operating expenses was primarily attributable to to the impact of a State of New York sales tax refund received by the Company during the Fiscal 2014 Period totaling approximately $16.8 million, increases in theatre level payroll expenses (approximately $14.0 million), increases in non-rent occupancy costs (approximately $7.0 million), increases in credit card fees and incremental expenses associated with increased internet ticketing surcharge fees (approximately $4.8 million) and increases in other theatre operating expenses (approximately $5.5 million).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S8	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $4.4 million , or 5.9% , to $78.8 million in the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $74.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S9	The increase in general and administrative expenses during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable to higher legal and professional fees (approximately $4.8 million) and corporate payroll costs (approximately $1.5 million), partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense (approximately $1.1 million).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S10	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.6 million , or 4.6% , to $216.8 million for the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $207.2 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S11	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily related to the impact of increased capital expenditures associated with the installation of luxury reclining seats subsequent to the Fiscal 2014 Period, and the opening of two new theatres with 24 screens (partially offset by the closure of nine theatres with 91 screens) subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S12	Income from Operations Income from operations increased $12.9 million , or 4.2% , to $319.3 million during the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $306.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S13	The increase in income from operations during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable to the increase in total revenues, partially offset by increases in certain variable operating expense line items described above.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S14	Interest Expense, net During the Fiscal 2015 Period, net interest expense increased $3.1 million , or 2.5% , to $129.6 million , from $126.5 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S15	The increase in net interest expense during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily due to incremental interest associated with a higher effective interest rate under the New Term Facility, partially offset by interest savings associated with the refinance of approximately $711.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes with the March 2014 issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S16	Earnings Recognized from NCM Earnings recognized from NCM decreased $1.1 million , or 3.4% , to $31.0 million in the Fiscal 2015 Period, from $32.1 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P39_S17	The decrease in earnings recognized from NCM during the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable to lower earnings of National CineMedia during the period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income Taxes The provision for income taxes of $100.1 million and $73.4 million for the Fiscal 2015 Period and the Fiscal 2014 Period, respectively, reflect effective tax rates of approximately 39.5% and 41.1% , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate for the Fiscal 2015 Period is primarily attributable to a decrease in the effective tax rate in certain states during the Fiscal 2015 Period and the state tax effects of the $62.4 million ($39.2 million after related tax effects) loss on debt extinguishment associated with the repurchase of approximately $711.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes that occurred during the Fiscal 2014 Period, which was not deductible in certain states.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The effective tax rates for such periods also reflect the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and other income tax credits.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interest Net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2015 Period was $153.4 million , which represents an increase of $47.8 million , from net income attributable to controlling interest of $105.6 million during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	The increase in net income attributable to controlling interest for the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable to the impact of the $62.4 million ($39.2 million after related tax effects) loss on debt extinguishment associated with the repurchase of approximately $711.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and Regal Cinemas' 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2014 Period, an increase in operating income as described above and higher equity income from certain of our non-consolidated entities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Fiscal 2014 Period Compared to Fiscal 2013 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2014 Period, total admissions revenues decreased $60.7 million, or 2.9%, to $1,998.9 million, from $2,059.6 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	A 3.7% decrease in attendance (approximately $76.2 million of total admissions revenues), partially offset by a 0.8% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $15.5 million of total admissions revenues) led to the overall decrease in the Fiscal 2014 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Fiscal 2014 Period results were favorably impacted by the timing of the Fiscal 2014 Period calendar, which consisted of fifty-three weeks compared to the fifty-two weeks during the Fiscal 2013 Period and the inclusion of the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters for the entire Fiscal 2014 Period (compared to nine months in the Fiscal 2013 Period).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	The additional week of operations was the week between Christmas and New Years, a traditionally high attendance and revenue week for the Company and the industry.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The additional week of operations was significant in that it accounted for approximately 8.7 million attendees, or 4.0%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total attendance and contributed to approximately $76.5 million, or 3.8%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Excluding week 53, the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters accounted for 11.8 million attendees, or 5.4%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total attendance and contributed approximately $90.2 million, or 4.5%, of the Fiscal 2014 Period total admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	However, these factors were offset by the impact of the decline in industry attendance during the Fiscal 2014 Period and as a result, total attendance for the Company's Fiscal 2014 Period decreased by 3.7%.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	The overall decline in attendance and admissions revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period was primarily a result of strong attendance generated by the breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period, which experienced record box office revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	On a comparable screen basis (i.e., excluding the effects of the impact of week 53 in the Fiscal 2014 Period and the 513 screens from Hollywood Theaters for the Fiscal 2014 Period and Fiscal 2013 Period), attendance for the Fiscal 2014 Period was approximately 199.7 million, an 8.6% decrease from the Fiscal 2013 Period, and admissions revenues for the Fiscal 2014 Period was approximately $1,832.2 million, a decrease of $150.6 million or 7.6% from the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P43_S6	On a comparable screen basis, an 8.6% decrease in attendance (approximately $170.5 million of admissions revenues), partially offset by a 1.1% increase in average ticket prices (approximately $19.9 million of admissions revenues) led to the net decline in the Fiscal 2014 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	We believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the motion picture studios.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The decline in comparable screen attendance and admissions revenues was primarily a result of the aforementioned breadth and commercial appeal of the overall film slate during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	The increase in our comparable screen average ticket price was due to selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews, partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium format films exhibited during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the decrease in our comparable screen admissions revenues on a per screen basis was greater than the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	We believe the greater than industry decrease in comparable screen admissions revenues on a per screen basis in the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to premium format film performance and the impact of our competitors' investment in new theatres and customer amenities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given fiscal period.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	On a comparable screen basis, total concessions revenues for the Fiscal 2014 Period was $752.1 million, a decrease of $28.1 million or 3.6% from the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	Such decrease was primarily attributable to the aforementioned 8.6% decrease in comparable screen attendance (approximately $67.1 million of concessions revenues), partially offset by a 5.6% increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $39.0 million of concessions revenues).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	The increase in comparable screen average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in popcorn and beverage sales volume per patron, selective price increases during the period and to a lesser extent, the continued rollout of our expanded food and alcohol menu.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P46_S7	During the Fiscal 2014 Period, other operating revenues were primarily impacted by a decrease in revenues related to our gift card and discount ticket programs (approximately $5.9 million) and decreases in revenues from our vendor marketing programs (approximately $1.0 million), offset by incremental National CineMedia revenues (approximately $3.9 million) and increases in other theatre revenues (approximately $3.0 million).

1168696_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	The decrease in cost of concessions as a percentage of concessions revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily related to an increase in the amount of vendor marketing revenues recorded as a reduction of cost of concessions and the impact of the aforementioned price increases during the period, partially offset by slight increases in raw material costs.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	Rent Expense Rent expense increased by $9.8 million, or 2.4%, to $423.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $413.6 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P47_S5	The increase in rent expense during the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily related to the opening of several new theatres late in the Fiscal 2013 Period, the opening of nine new theatres with 98 screens (partially offset by the closure of 15 theatres with 125 screens) subsequent to the end of the Fiscal 2013 Period and incremental rent associated with the leases acquired as part of the Hollywood Theaters acquisition.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Such decrease was attributable to the aforementioned State of New York sales tax refund and decreased costs associated with lower premium format film revenues during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 0.9%, to $74.4 million in the Fiscal 2014 Period, from $73.7 million in the Fiscal 2013 Period.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Under the terms of the Amended Senior Credit Facility, Regal Cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to Regal, its indirect parent.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Since Regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries, this restriction could impact Regal's ability to effect future debt or dividend payments, pay corporate expenses, repurchase or retire for cash its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	The $85.3 million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period was caused by positive fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $78.4 million and a $6.9 million increase in net income excluding non-cash items.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	Working capital activity was primarily impacted by changes in accounts payable activity and accrued expense and other activity, partially offset by changes in trade and other receivables activity during the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	The change in accounts payable activity and accrued expense and other activity was primarily due to the timing of film and certain other vendor payments associated with increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	The change in accounts receivable activity was primarily attributable to an increase in credit card receivable activity associated with increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2015 Period and the timing of payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor marketing programs.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S5	The $2.2 million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period increase was caused by a $40.1 million increase in net income excluding non-cash items, largely offset by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately $37.9 million.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S6	Working capital activity was primarily impacted by changes in accrued expense and other activity and deferred revenue, partially offset by changes in accounts receivable activity during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S7	The change in accrued expense and other activity was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments associated with increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S8	The change in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased redemptions during our 53rd week of operations in the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P58_S9	The change in accounts receivable activity was attributable to the timing of collections as a result of the additional week of operations during Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres, new theatre construction, strategic partnerships, the addition of luxury amenities in select theatres, adding new screens to existing theatres, and other upgrades to the Company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	We fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows, cash on hand, landlord contributions and proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	We intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects, with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non-maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the Company s internal rate of return targets.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The $32.9 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2015 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period, was primarily attributable to a $18.6 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) during the Fiscal 2015 Period, $9.2 million of cash used for the acquisition of five theatres with 61 screens from entities affiliated with Georgia Theatre Company, and the impact of $6.0 million in proceeds received related to the sale of RealD, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	The $108.2 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2014 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period, was primarily attributable to the impact of the $194.4 million acquisition of Hollywood Theaters during the Fiscal 2013 Period, partially offset by a $50.3 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) during the Fiscal 2014 Period and the impact of proceeds of $40.9 million related to the sale of NCM, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2013 Period.

1168696_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	Proceeds of the New Term Facility (approximately $963.3 million, net of debt discount) were applied to refinance the term loan under the Prior Senior Credit Facility, which had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $963.2 million.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	As a result of the amendment, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $5.7 million during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	In connection with the Amended Senior Credit Facility, on April 2, 2015, Regal Cinemas entered into amendments of two of its existing interest rate swap agreements (which are described further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) initially designated to hedge $350.0 million of variable rate debt obligations under the prior Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	The amended interest rate swaps require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.22% to 2.165% (formerly 0.817% to 1.828%) and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $958.8 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the New Term Facility, $775.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the New Revolving Facility.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of certain rating agencies, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the Company's current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P65_S4	An upgrade or downgrade of the Company's debt ratings, depending on the extent, could affect the cost to borrow funds.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P65_S5	There were no upgrades or downgrades to the Company's debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	During the Fiscal 2015 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $139.1 million in the aggregate.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The dividend is payable on March 15, 2016 to our stockholders of record on March 4, 2016 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	These dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were approximately $(178.6) million , $(332.5) million and $83.1 million for the Fiscal 2015 Period, the Fiscal 2014 Period and the Fiscal 2013 Period, respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	The net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period of $153.9 million was primarily attributable to a $155.7 million decrease in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2015 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2014 Fiscal Period, lower payments on long-term obligations and landlord contributions received in connection with amended lease financing arrangements, partially offset by the net impact of the Amended Senior Credit Facility refinancing effected during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	The net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2014 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2013 Period of $415.6 million was primarily attributable to $764.3 million of cash used to repurchase our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2014 Period, the impact of $500.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 in the Fiscal 2013 Period and a $162.6 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2014 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2013 Fiscal Period, partially offset by $775.0 million in gross proceeds received in connection with the Fiscal 2014 Period issuance of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022 and the impact of $244.3 million of cash used to repurchase a portion of our 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2013 Period.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") was approximately $599.9 million , $512.7 million and $606.2 million for the Fiscal 2015 Period, the Fiscal 2014 Period and the Fiscal 2013 Period, respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase in EBITDA for the Fiscal 2015 Period was primarily attributable the impact of the $62.4 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the repurchase of approximately $711.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and Regal Cinemas' 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2014 Period and to a lesser extent, an increase in operating income as described above and higher equity income from certain of our non-consolidated entities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	The decrease in EBITDA for the Fiscal 2014 Period was primarily attributable to a decline in operating income as described above, the $62.4 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the refinance of approximately $711.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes and Regal Cinemas' 8 5 / 8 % Senior Notes during the Fiscal 2014 Period and the impact of the $30.9 million gain on sale of NCM, Inc. common stock recorded during the Fiscal 2013 Period, partially offset by the impact of the $30.3 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the Fiscal 2013 Period refinance of approximately $213.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1 / 8 % Senior Notes.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company uses EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, for servicing our debt, paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs, prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors for these purposes as well.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by or used in operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, since it omits the impact of interest, taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash (such as receivables, payables and inventories) as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items (such as long-term loss accruals and deferred items).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	Because EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized, which assets will often have to be replaced in the future.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	Further, EBITDA, because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service, income taxes, cash dividends, capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	Nonetheless, EBITDA is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe, and we concur, that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs, respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	We also evaluate EBITDA because it is clear that movements in these non-GAAP measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	A reconciliation of EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows (in millions):
1168696_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Interest Rate Swaps As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2015 , the Company maintained two effective hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements (maturity dates ranging from December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2018), which require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.220% to 2.165% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	These interest rate swap agreements are designated to hedge $350.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 4.76% as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's interest rate swaps' fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Sale-Leaseback Transactions For information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions, refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The Company has assumed long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Other than the operating leases that are detailed below, the Company does not utilize variable interest entities or any other form of off-balance sheet financing.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's estimated contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next several periods are as follows (in millions):
1168696_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our Amended Senior Credit Facility provides for mandatory prepayments under certain scenarios.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our long-term debt obligations and related matters.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	(2) Future interest payments on the Company's unhedged debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 (consisting of approximately $610.9 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Facility, $775.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and approximately $8.1 million of other debt obligations) are based on the stated fixed rate or in the case of the $610.9 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Facility, the current interest rate specified in our Amended Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015 (3.83%).
1168696_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Future interest payments on the Company's hedged indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 (the remaining $350.0 million of borrowings under the New Term Facility) are based on (1) the applicable margin (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) as of December 31, 2015 (3.0%) and (2) the expected fixed interest payments under the Company's interest rate swap agreements, which are described in further detail under Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	Future interest payments are calculated based on interest rates implicit in the underlying leases, which have a weighted average interest rate of 11.29%, maturing in various installments through 2028.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P79_S3	Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P79_S4	(4) Includes estimated capital expenditures and investments to which we were committed as of December 31, 2015 , including improvements associated with existing theatres (including luxury reclining seating), the construction of new theatres and investments in non-consolidated entities.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P79_S5	With respect to our luxury reclining seating conversions, we expect to receive approximately $19.9 million in landlord contributions to partially cover the costs of such conversions.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S3	Our operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) The table does not include approximately $8.8 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized state tax benefits because the timing of the related payments was not reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S4	In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , Regal Cinemas had approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the $85.0 million New Revolving Facility.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S5	Regal Cinemas also maintains a sublimit within the New Revolving Facility of $10.0 million for short-term loans and $30.0 million for letters of credit.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P80_S6	We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our New Revolving Facility will be adequate for the Company to execute its business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for the next 12 months.
1168696_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the operating leases detailed above in this Form 10-K, under the heading "Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments," the Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.

1168696_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas pays interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.220% to 2.165% and receives interest at a variable rate.
1168696_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , borrowings of $958.8 million (net of debt discount) and $965.8 million , respectively, were outstanding under the New Term Facility and term facility under the Prior Senior Credit Facility at an effective interest rate of 4.17% (as of December 31, 2015 ) and 3.23% (as of January 1, 2015), after the impact of interest rate swaps is taken into account.
1168696_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company's effective interest rate under the New Term Facility as of December 31, 2015 , would increase or decrease interest expense by $4.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of such controls as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, our management believes that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Regal Entertainment Group: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	We also have audited Regal Entertainment Group s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	Regal Entertainment Group s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1168696_16_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P4_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P4_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P4_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also in our opinion, Regal Entertainment Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) .

1168696_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P20_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P20_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to amounts received for agreeing to the existing National CineMedia exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") modification, amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement described in Note 4 "Investments," and amounts received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Company states inventories on the basis of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost, which is not in excess of net realizable value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company states property and equipment at cost.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , the Company capitalized approximately $12.6 million and $21.7 million , respectively, of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P27_S2	The Company also capitalizes certain direct external costs associated with software developed for internal use after the preliminary software project stage is completed and Company management has authorized further funding for a software project and it is deemed probable of completion.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P27_S3	The Company capitalizes these external software development costs only until the point at which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company records depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , included in property and equipment is $185.9 million and $183.2 million of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $104.1 million and $87.4 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets (including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities as described further below) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	impact of recent ticket price changes, strategic initiatives, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of whether or not a triggering event has occurred that indicates impairment of individual theatre assets may be necessary.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	For theatres where a triggering event is identified, impairment is measured based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Significant judgment is involved in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, estimating future cash flows and determining fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Triggering events identified resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $15.6 million , $5.6 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Certain leases for Company theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	None of our lease agreements require us to return the leased property to the lessor in its original condition (allowing for normal wear and tear) or to remove leasehold improvements at our cost.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P38_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P38_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company accounts for lease incentive payments received from a landlord in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Lease Incentives , and records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the base term of the lease.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was approximately $328.7 million and $320.4 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	As part of the Company s ongoing operations, we may close certain theatres within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the theatre or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Additionally, we generally abandon certain assets associated with a closed theatre, primarily leasehold improvements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, goodwill associated with that business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	We evaluate whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business on the date of closure.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	Generally, on the date of closure, the closed theatre does not constitute a business because the Company retains assets and processes on that date essential to the operation of the theatre.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	These assets and processes are significant missing elements impeding the operation of a business.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P51_S4	Accordingly, when closing individual theatres, we generally do not include goodwill in the calculation of any gain or loss on disposal of the related assets.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 indicated that the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , intangible assets totaled $67.1 million before accumulated amortization of $16.9 million and $13.2 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	Such intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	consist of favorable leases (approximately $66.0 million before accumulated amortization of $16.3 million ) acquired in connection with various acquisitions since fiscal 2008.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , the Company recognized $3.7 million , $3.7 million and $3.3 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 31, 2015 is projected below (in millions):
1168696_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	During the year ended December 26, 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million pertaining to certain favorable leases associated with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P58_S5	The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities as of December 31, 2015 was approximately $321.8 million .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and RealD, Inc. and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	There was no impairment of the Company's investments during the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P62_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations under Regal Cinemas' Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	Certain of these interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated or de-designated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S4	See Note 14 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company s interest rate swaps fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S5	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S6	The counterparties to the Company s interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P66_S7	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Deferred revenue relates primarily to the amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification, amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia, cash received from the sale of discount tickets and gift cards, and amounts received in connection with vendor marketing programs.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement will be amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , approximately $188.5 million and $168.7 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the gift cards and discount tickets was recorded as a component of current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	Generally, less than one - third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within 2 to 3 months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P70_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at the Company's theatres and earn concession or ticket awards based on the number of credits accumulated.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those related to film costs, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , the Company managed its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Total comprehensive income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 was $152.6 million , $106.1 million and $159.5 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangement, the change in fair value of available for sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments), the reclassification adjustment for gain on sale of available for sale securities recognized in net income and the change in fair value of equity method investee interest rate swap transactions during each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	ASU 2014-08 changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and includes enhanced disclosures about discontinued operations.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	Under the update, only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations in the financial statements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	ASU 2014-08 is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim reporting periods within those years.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	ASU 2014-08 became effective for the Company as of the beginning of fiscal 2015 and has been applied prospectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	However, the standard was deferred by ASU 2015-14, issued by the FASB in August 2015, and is now effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718) .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	ASU 2014-12 is intended to resolve the diverse accounting treatment of share-based awards that require a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period for which the requisite service has already been rendered.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P86_S3	ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P86_S4	The Company expects to apply the amendments prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date and expects to adopt ASU 2014-12 as of the beginning of fiscal 2016.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P86_S5	The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2014-12 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which provides guidance on evaluating whether a reporting entity should consolidate certain legal entities.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	Further, the amendments eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, as well as affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	A reporting entity may apply the amendments using a modified retrospective approach or a full retrospective application.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest , which intends to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	Under current U.S. GAAP, debt issuance costs are reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	ASU 2015-03 requires that they be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, which is similar to the presentation of debt discounts or premiums.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	The standard requires retrospective application and the Company expects to adopt ASU 2015-03 as of the beginning of fiscal 2016.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in Cloud Computing Arrangement.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S2	If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S3	If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S4	The guidance will not change GAAP for a customer s accounting for service contracts.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S5	In addition, the guidance in this ASU supersedes paragraph 350-40-25-16.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P93_S6	Consequently, all software licenses within the scope of Subtopic 350-40 will be accounted for consistent with other licenses of intangible assets.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	ASU 2015-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which affects reporting entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	Specifically, ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P95_S2	Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P95_S3	Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	ASU 2015-15 adds clarification to the guidance presented in ASU 2015-03, as that guidance did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	The Company plans to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2016 along with the original guidance in ASU 2015-03.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	ASU 2015-16 was issued to simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination and eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	ASU 2015-16 requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, amounts recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Company does not expect ASU 2015-16 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which will require the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and asset be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P100_S3	The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2015-17 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	On September 3, 2015, Regal completed the acquisition of five theatres with 61 screens from entities affiliated with Georgia Theatre Company for an aggregate net cash purchase price, before post-closing adjustments, of $9.2 million .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	The acquisition enhanced the Company s presence in the state of Georgia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The aggregate net cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management s judgment after evaluating several factors.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P102_S2	The results of operations of the five acquired theatres have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The following is a summary of the preliminary allocation of the aggregate net cash purchase price (before post-closing adjustments) to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired that have been recognized by the Company in its consolidated balance sheet as of the date of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	On March 29, 2013, Regal completed the acquisition of Hollywood Theaters, whereby it acquired a total of 43 theatres with 513 screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of $194.4 million .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P104_S1	In addition, the Company assumed approximately $47.9 million of capital lease and lease financing obligations, and certain working capital.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P104_S2	The cash portion of the purchase price included repayment of approximately $167.0 million of the sellers debt.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P104_S3	The acquisition of Hollywood Theaters enhanced the Company s presence in 16 states and 3 U.S. territories.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P104_S4	The Company incurred approximately $3.0 million in transaction costs in connection with this transaction.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	The aggregate net cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including an independent third party valuation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	The results of operations of the acquired theatres have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following is a summary of the final allocation of the aggregate net cash purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed that have been recognized by the Company in its consolidated balance sheet as of the date of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	The transaction included the assumption of lease financing obligations associated with 14 acquired theatres and various capital lease obligations, which are presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	Such obligations have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 10.7% and mature in various installments through December 2030.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	In addition, the transaction included the acquisition of favorable leases (approximately $34.4 million ) and unfavorable leases (approximately $10.7 million ), which are presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a component of "Intangible Assets, net" and "Other Non-Current Liabilities," respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P107_S3	The weighted average amortization period for the favorable leases and the unfavorable leases are approximately 18 years and 15 years, respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed and is not deductible for tax purposes.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	National CineMedia concentrates on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S3	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S4	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_16_ITEM8_P111_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one -to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO and receipt of proceeds in excess of our investment balance, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	Accordingly, we will not provide for any additional losses as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P112_S3	Until such time, equity in earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P112_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	The modification extended the term of the exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") to 30 years , provided National CineMedia with a 5 -year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.0756 payment per patron which increases by 8% every 5 years starting at the end of fiscal 2011, a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which increases by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $1,182 for fiscal 2015) and an additional payment per digital screen of $608 for fiscal 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P115_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P115_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P115_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million , which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P116_S2	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	Under the units of revenue method, amortization for a period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the ESA modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P118_S4	If the Company elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Additional Investments Tranche at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for the Additional Investments Tranche common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a non-operating gain or loss.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 31, 2015 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 11.8 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 2-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P201_S2	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $34.9 million and $34.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , respectively, as management believes it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in future tax periods.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P201_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P201_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the valuation allowance was increased by $0.1 million related to management's determination that it was more likely than not that certain state net operating losses created in prior years would not be realized.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	In accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, a reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was as follows (in millions):
1168696_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $2.2 million and $4.5 million within the next twelve months primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was $6.8 million and $7.1 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P205_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , the Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of approximately $2.2 million and $2.0 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P205_S2	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 was $0.3 million , $0.2 million and $0.0 million , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries collectively file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and U.S. territory jurisdictions.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P207_S1	Territory examinations for years before 2011.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P207_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) closed an examination of the Company s 2010 and 2012 federal income tax returns and notified the Company that no items were being disputed.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	On October 9, 2012, staff at the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Board (the "Regional Board") notified United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ( UATC ), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that the Regional Board was contemplating issuing a cleanup and abatement order to UATC with respect to a property in Santa Clara, California that UATC owned and then leased during the 1960s and 1970s.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Regional Board issued a tentative order to UATC setting out proposed site clean-up requirements for UATC with respect to the property.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P211_S2	According to the Regional Board, the property in question has been contaminated by dry-cleaning facilities that operated at the property in question from approximately 1961 until 1996.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P211_S3	The Regional Board also issued a tentative order to the current property owner, who has been conducting site investigation and remediation activities at the site for several years.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P211_S4	UATC submitted comments to the Regional Board on July 28, 2013, objecting to the tentative order.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P211_S5	The Regional Board considered the matter at its regular meeting on September 11, 2013 and adopted the tentative order with only minor changes.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	On October 11, 2013, UATC filed a petition with the State Water Resources Control Board ( State Board ) for review of the Regional Board s order.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P212_S1	The State Board failed to act on the petition and hence by operation of law it was deemed denied and UATC filed a petition for writ of mandamus with the California Superior Court seeking review and modification of the order.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P212_S2	UATC is cooperating with the Regional Board while its petition remains pending before the State Board.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P212_S3	To that end, UATC and the current property owner jointly submitted, and on October 27, 2015, the Regional Board approved, a Remedial Action Plan ( RAP ) to remediate the dry-cleaner contamination.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P212_S4	UATC intends to vigorously defend this matter.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P212_S5	We believe that we are, and were during the period in question described in this paragraph, in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P216_S4	While we do not believe that the Company has engaged in any violation of Federal or state antitrust or competition laws during its participation in NCM and other joint ventures, we can provide no assurances as to the scope, timing or outcome of the DOJ s or any other state or Federal governmental reviews of the Company s conduct.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	In situations where management believes that a loss arising from proceedings described herein is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no amount within the range is more probable than another.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P226_S1	As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these proceedings is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P226_S2	The amounts reserved for such proceedings totaled approximately $4.0 million as of December 31, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P226_S3	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P226_S4	Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Company believes the risk of loss is more than slight.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P226_S5	Management is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for cases described herein in which damages have not been specified and (i) the proceedings are in early stages, (ii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal issues presented.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P227_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P227_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	In prior years, private litigants and the DOJ had filed claims against the Company alleging that a number of theatres with stadium seating violated the ADA because these theatres allegedly failed to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with lines of sight comparable to those available to other members of the general public and denied persons in wheelchairs access to the stadium portion of the theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P228_S1	On June 8, 2005, Regal reached an agreement with the DOJ resolving and dismissing the private litigants claims and all claims made by the United States under the ADA.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P228_S2	On December 9, 2010, the parties renewed the Consent Decree for another three year term.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	From time to time, the Company receives claims that the stadium seating offered by theatres allegedly violates the ADA.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P229_S1	In these instances, the Company seeks to resolve or dismiss these claims based on the terms of the DOJ settlement or under applicable ADA standards.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	The accessibility of theatres to persons with visual impairments or that are deaf or hard of hearing remains a topic of interest to the DOJ and they have published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the provision of closed captioning and descriptive audio within the theatre environment.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P230_S1	The Company believes it provides the members of the visually and hearing impaired communities with reasonable access to the movie-going experience, and has deployed new digital captioning and descriptive video systems that should meet all such potential requirements or expectations of any federal, state or individual concerns.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P230_S2	The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P230_S3	The Company intends to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth above, does not currently anticipate that compliance will require the Company to expend substantial funds.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P232_S1	Under these circumstances, the executive shall be entitled to receive severance payments equal to (i) the actual bonus, pro-rated to the date of termination, that executive would have received with respect to the fiscal year in which the termination occurs; (ii) two times the executive's annual base salary plus one times the executive's target bonus; and (iii) continued coverage under any medical, health and life insurance plans for a 24 -month period following the date of termination.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P235_S1	Each Executive is also subject to a permanent covenant to maintain confidentiality of the Company's confidential information.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P277_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P278_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P278_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P279_S0	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, or vesting of restricted stock and performance share units.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P279_S1	The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock and performance share units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P279_S2	In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P280_S0	The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P280_S1	The earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P281_S0	are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P281_S1	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P282_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share and per share data):
1168696_16_ITEM8_P283_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations under Regal Cinemas' Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P283_S1	Certain of these interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P283_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P283_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated or de-designated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P283_S4	See Note 14 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company s interest rate swaps fair value estimation methods and assumptions.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P285_S1	Since the terms of the interest rate swaps designated in the original cash flow hedge relationships changed with these amendments, we de-designated the original hedge relationships and re-designated the amended interest rate swaps in new cash flow hedge relationships as of the amendment date of April 2, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P286_S0	No amendments or modifications were made to two existing interest swap agreements (originally designated to hedge $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations).
1168696_16_ITEM8_P286_S1	Since such interest rate swaps no longer met the highly effective qualification for cash flow hedge accounting, the two hedge relationships were de-designated effective April 2, 2015.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P286_S2	Accordingly, since the interest rate swaps no longer qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the change in their fair values since de-designation have been recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of interest expense during the period of change.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P287_S0	On June 30, 2015, one of these interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P287_S1	The remaining interest rate swap agreement (designated to hedge $100.0 million of variable rate debt obligations) expired on December 31, 2015.

1168696_16_ITEM8_P295_S0	(2) Amounts represent the change in fair value of the former hedging derivatives and are recorded as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P296_S0	Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P296_S1	The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P297_S0	The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P297_S1	Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P298_S0	Level 1 Inputs: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P299_S0	Level 2 Inputs: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P300_S0	Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P301_S0	The following tables summarize the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 :
1168696_16_ITEM8_P302_S0	The fair value of the RealD, Inc. shares is determined using RealD, Inc.'s publicly traded common stock price, which falls under Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P302_S1	The held shares of RealD, Inc. stock are accounted for as available for sale equity securities and recurring fair value adjustments to these shares are recorded to "Other Non-Current Assets" with a corresponding entry to "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" on a quarterly basis.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P302_S2	The fair value of the 322,780 RealD, Inc. common shares held as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was based on the publicly traded common stock price of RealD, Inc. of $10.55 per share and $11.80 per share, respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P302_S3	(2) The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps described in Note 13 "Derivative Instruments" is based on Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P303_S0	The counterparties to the Company s interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P303_S1	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P304_S0	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P304_S1	There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P305_S0	In addition, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P305_S1	The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument are as follows:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P306_S0	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P307_S0	The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P308_S0	As further described in Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the Company regularly reviews long-lived assets (primarily property and equipment), intangible assets and investments in non-consolidated entities, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P308_S1	When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P309_S0	The Company s analysis relative to long-lived assets resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $15.6 million , $5.6 million and $9.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 and December 26, 2013 , respectively.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P309_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres we deemed other than temporary.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P310_S0	In addition, during the year ended December 26, 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million pertaining to certain favorable leases associated with the acquisition of Consolidated Theatres.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P310_S1	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P311_S0	Finally, the Company did not record an impairment of any investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method during the years ended December 31, 2015 , January 1, 2015 or December 26, 2013 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P312_S0	Long term obligations, excluding capital lease obligations, lease financing arrangements and other:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P313_S0	The fair value of the Amended Senior Credit Facility described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations," which consists of the New Term Facility and the New Revolving Facility, is estimated based on quoted prices (Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P313_S1	The associated interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and are assumed to approximate fair value.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P313_S2	The fair values of the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, and the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 were estimated based on quoted prices (Level 1 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) for these issuances as of as of December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 .
1168696_16_ITEM8_P314_S0	The aggregate carrying values and fair values of long-term debt at December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 consist of the following:
1168696_16_ITEM8_P315_S0	The following tables present for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net by component (in millions):

1168696_16_ITEM8_P316_S1	As of the calculation date, which was January 9, 2016, threshold performance goals for these awards were satisfied, and therefore, all 262,476 outstanding performance shares were converted to restricted shares as of January 9, 2016.
1168696_16_ITEM8_P316_S2	In connection with the conversion of the above 262,476 performance shares, the Company paid a cumulative cash dividend of $3.60 (representing the sum of all cash dividends paid from January 9, 2013 through January 9, 2016) on each performance share converted, totaling approximately $0.9 million .

1168696_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview We operate one of the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the United States, consisting of 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016 , with approximately 211 million attendees for the year ended December 31, 2016 ("fiscal 2016 ").
1168696_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	For fiscal 2014 and prior periods, the Company's fiscal year ended on the first Thursday after December 25, which in certain years (such as fiscal 2014) resulted in a 53-week fiscal year.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Beginning January 2, 2015, the Company's fiscal year changed from a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25 of each year to a fiscal year ending on December 31 of each year.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	For fiscal 2016 , we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $3,197.1 million , $339.4 million and $170.4 million , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	In addition, we generated $410.5 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to allocate capital effectively to enhance value for our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S5	This strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S6	Our business strategy should enable us to continue to produce the free cash flow necessary to maintain a prudent allocation of our capital among dividend payments, debt service and repayment and investment in our theatre assets, all to provide meaningful value to our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S7	Key elements of our business strategy include: Maximizing Stockholder Value.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S8	We believe that our cash dividends are an efficient means of distributing value to our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P4_S9	From our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2002 through December 31, 2016 , we have returned approximately $4.2 billion to our stockholders in the form of quarterly and extraordinary cash dividends.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	recent five year period, we returned approximately $1.0 billion to our stockholders in quarterly and extraordinary cash dividends.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	Pursuing Prudent Acquisitions and Maximizing Strategic Partnerships.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P5_S2	We believe that our acquisition experience and capital structure position us well to take advantage of future acquisition opportunities and to participate in various partnership initiatives.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P5_S3	We intend to selectively pursue accretive theatre acquisitions and theatre-related investments that enhance and more fully utilize our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P5_S4	With respect to partnership initiatives, we own approximately 19.7% of National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM") as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	National CineMedia operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America and focuses on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC Entertainment, Inc. ("AMC"), and Cinemark, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	See "National CineMedia Joint Venture" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	We also participate in other joint ventures and partnerships such as Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC ("DCIP"), Open Road Films, AC JV, LLC ("AC JV"), Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition ("DCDC") and Atom Tickets, LLC ("Atom Tickets"), which are also further discussed under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K. We believe our investment in National CineMedia and other joint venture arrangements generate incremental value for our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	We continue to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts:
1168696_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	First, we continued to improve customer amenities, primarily through the installation of luxury reclining seats.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of December 31, 2016, we offered luxury reclining seating in 1,369 auditoriums at 113 theatre locations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	We expect to install luxury reclining seating in approximately 40-45 locations during 2017 and expect to outfit approximately 45% of the total screens in our circuit by the end of 2019.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by contributions from our theatre landlords.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Second, to address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results, and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2016, we offered an expanded menu of food in 216 locations (reaching approximately 53% of our fiscal 2016 attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 143 locations (reaching approximately 28% of our fiscal 2016 attendees), and we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 270 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 215 locations by the end of 2017.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Third, we continued to implement various customer engagement initiatives aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for our customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	For example, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the national rollout of the new Regal Crown Club .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	Members of the enhanced program can earn unlimited credits and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center where members can select the rewards of their choice.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P9_S4	We believe these changes allow us to offer more relevant offers to our members and increase customer engagement in the program.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P9_S5	As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.8 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	In addition, we continued to develop and enhance other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	For example, we have improved the customer experience of purchasing tickets by expanding our ability to sell tickets remotely via our mobile ticketing application and through our internet ticketing partners such as Fandango.com and Atom Tickets.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Customers can choose their preferred ticketing option, which in many cases means they can pre-purchase tickets, scan their mobile device and proceed directly to their reserved seat without waiting in line.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	In addition to providing customers the ability to pre-purchase tickets, our mobile ticketing application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, track Regal Crown Club credits and receive special offers from Regal.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P10_S4	Finally, at nearly one third of our locations, our newest ticketing partner, Atom Tickets, provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P10_S5	We believe these technologies provide a platform for delivering a quality customer experience and will drive incremental revenues and cash flows in a more cost-effective manner.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Finally, our IMAX digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM , offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We continue to selectively install RPX SM screens where we can generate a financial return, and we have recently agreed to install an additional 11 IMAX digital projection systems, which will ultimately expand our IMAX footprint to 100 screens.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe the continued rollout of premium amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and alcoholic beverage offerings and IMAX and RPX SM screens allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for a majority of our customers.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We believe this strategy will enable us to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	Pursuing Selective Growth Opportunities and Active Asset Management.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	We intend to selectively pursue expansion opportunities through new theatre construction, expansion and upgrades that meet our strategic and financial return criteria.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	Additionally, we manage our asset base by opportunistically closing underperforming theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P12_S6	We continued to actively manage our asset base during fiscal 2016 by opening two theatres with 19 screens, reopening five screens at an existing theatre and closing 13 theatres and 118 screens, ending the year with 561 theatres and 7,267 screens.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on future opportunities: Industry Leader.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We are one of the largest domestic motion picture exhibitors operating 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	We believe that the quality and size of our theatre circuit is a significant competitive advantage for negotiating attractive national contracts and generating economies of scale.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	We believe that our market leadership allows us to capitalize on favorable attendance trends and attractive consolidation and partnership opportunities.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S4	Superior Management Drives Strong Operating Margins.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S5	Our operating philosophy focuses on efficient operations and strict cost controls at both the corporate and theatre levels.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S6	At the corporate level, we are able to capitalize on our size and operational expertise to achieve economies of scale in purchasing and marketing functions.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P14_S7	We have developed an efficient purchasing and distribution supply chain that generates favorable concession margins.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	At the theatre level, management devotes significant attention to cost controls through the use of financial data analysis, detailed management reports and performance-based compensation programs to encourage theatre managers to deliver a premium customer experience while effectively controlling costs and maximizing free cash flow.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have significant experience identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions of theatre circuits.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Since our 2002 IPO, we have demonstrated our ability to enhance revenues and realize operating efficiencies through the successful acquisition and integration of nine theatre circuits, consisting of 230 theatres and 2,683 screens.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We have generally achieved immediate synergies at acquired theatres and improved their profitability through the application of our consolidated operating functions and key supplier contracts, and our relationship with National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe that we operate one of the most modern theatre circuits among major motion picture exhibitors.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	Approximately 59% of our locations featured one or more premium amenity offerings as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S5	We believe the continued rollout of premium amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and alcoholic beverage offerings and IMAX and RPX SM screens allow us to deliver a premium movie-going experience for a majority of our customers.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P16_S6	Finally, we believe that our modern theatre portfolio coupled with our operating margins should allow us to generate significant cash flows from operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Dividend Policy We believe that paying dividends on our shares of common stock is important to our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	To that end, during fiscal 2016 , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of our Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	Further, on February 9, 2017 , the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2017 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Declared dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P17_S6	Dividends are considered quarterly and may be paid only when, and in such amounts as, approved by our Board of Directors.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The domestic motion picture exhibition industry is a mature business that has historically maintained steady long-term growth in revenues and stable attendance.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Since 1965, total box office revenues have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 5%, with annual attendance of approximately 1.3 billion attendees in 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	Against this background of steady long-term growth in revenues, the exhibition industry has experienced periodic short-term increases and decreases in attendance and in turn box office revenues.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	Consequently, we expect the cyclical nature of the domestic motion picture exhibition industry to continue for the foreseeable future.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	However, we believe that long-term trends in motion picture attendance in the U.S. will continue to benefit the domestic motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P18_S5	For example, during the most recent five-year period, attendance levels remained stable and the industry generated record box office results during 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Through the years, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry has experienced increased competition from other methods of delivering content to consumers including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Traditionally, when motion picture distributors license their films to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their products to other delivery channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Over the past several years, the average period between a film's theatrical release and its release in the next distribution channel has contracted slightly to approximately three to four months.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S4	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S5	Fundamentally, we believe that movie-going is a convenient, affordable and attractively priced form of out-of-home entertainment, which, on an average price per patron basis, continues to compare favorably to other out-of-home entertainment alternatives, such as concerts and sporting events.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S6	Finally, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of implementing various initiatives, concepts and customer amenities aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty, which we believe will provide us the opportunity for incremental revenue and cash flows.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S7	These initiatives include luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service, reserved seating, the enhancement of loyalty programs and other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S8	In addition, we believe the benefits associated with premium motion picture formats are significant for our industry and provide us with the opportunity for incremental revenue from formats such as IMAX and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S9	Finally, we believe that operating a digital theatre circuit provides greater flexibility in scheduling our programming content, which has enhanced our capacity utilization, and enables us to generate incremental revenue from motion picture formats, such as digital 3D, and the exhibition of specialty content offerings through certain distributors, such as AC JV.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P20_S10	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	THEATRE OPERATIONS We operate one of the largest theatre circuits in the United States with 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	We operate theatres in 46 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	We target prime locations with excellent access to large, high patron-traffic areas.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S4	Our multi-screen theatre complexes typically contain 10 to 18 screens, each with auditoriums ranging from 100 to 500 seats.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S5	As a result, our theatres appeal to a diverse group of patrons because we offer a wide selection of films and convenient show times.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S6	In addition, many of our theatres feature state-of-the-art amenities such as immersive sound, wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling screens, Sony Digital Cinema TM 4K projection systems, 3D digital projection systems, IMAX and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM , digital stereo surround-sound and enhanced interiors featuring video game and party room areas adjacent to the theatre lobby.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S7	Finally, we are in the process of implementing various other initiatives, concepts and customer amenities such as luxury reclining seating, a wider array of food and beverage offerings, in-theatre dining and bar service and reserved seating.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S8	Our modern, multi-screen theatres are designed to increase profitability by optimizing revenues per square foot while reducing our operational costs on a per attendee basis.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P21_S9	We vary auditorium seating capacities within the same theatre, allowing us to exhibit films on a more cost effective basis for a longer period of time by shifting films to smaller auditoriums to meet changing attendance levels.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	rent and utility costs over a higher revenue base.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We strategically schedule movie show times to reduce staffing requirements and box office and concession line congestion and to provide more desirable parking and traffic flow patterns.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We also actively monitor ticket sales in order to quickly recognize demand surges, which enables us to add seating capacity quickly and efficiently.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition, we offer various forms of convenient ticketing methods, including print-at-home technology, self-serve kiosks, e-gift cards and mobile and internet ticketing.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe that operating a theatre circuit consisting primarily of modern theatres enhances our ability to attract patrons and believe theatres larger than the current 10 to 18 screen megaplex are not able to generate attractive returns in most locations because of the substantial market suitability requirements to generate a level of profitability similar to the current megaplex format.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016 :
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have implemented a best practices management program across all of our theatres that provides daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management reports for each individual theatre, and we maintain active communication between the theatres, divisional management and corporate management.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	We use these management reports and communications to closely monitor admissions and concessions revenues as well as accounting, payroll and workforce information necessary to manage our theatre operations effectively and efficiently.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	We seek experienced theatre managers and require new theatre managers to complete a comprehensive training program within the theatres and at the "Regal Entertainment University," which is held at our corporate office.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	The program is designed to encompass all phases of theatre operations, including our operating philosophy, policies, procedures and standards.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S4	In addition, we have an incentive compensation program for theatre-level management that rewards theatre managers for controlling operating expenses while complying with our operating standards.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S5	In addition, we have implemented quality assurance programs in all of our theatres to maintain clean, comfortable and modern facilities and monitor food service.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S6	To maintain quality and consistency within our theatre circuit, district and regional managers and various contractual service partners regularly inspect each theatre and provide recurring feedback.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S7	In addition, we consistently solicit feedback from our patrons through an on-line guest experience program whereby our guests rate and provide detailed comments regarding their experiences at our theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P25_S8	Finally, we also conduct a "mystery shopper" program, which involves unannounced visits by unidentified customers who report on the quality of service, film presentation and cleanliness at individual theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing over 20,500 U.S. theatre screens (of which approximately 20,100 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	During 2016, over 700 million patrons attended movies shown in theatres in which National CineMedia currently has exclusive cinema advertising agreements in place.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	National CineMedia focuses on in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which includes us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	We receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by Regal, AMC and Cinemark will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we held approximately 27.1 million common units of National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	On a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.7% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	During fiscal 2013, National CineMedia sold its "Fathom Events" business to AC JV, a newly-formed Delaware limited liability company owned 32% by each of RCI, AMC and Cinemark and 4% by National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Fathom Events business markets and distributes live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to various theatre operators (including us, AMC and Cinemark) to provide additional programs to augment their feature film schedule and includes events such as live and pre-recorded concerts, opera and symphony, DVD product releases and marketing events, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, live sporting events and other special events.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions, including AC JV.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	We maintain an investment in DCIP, a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	DCIP funds the cost of digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	DCIP s initial and second round of financing substantially covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	In addition to its U.S. digital deployment, DCIP actively manages the deployment of over 1,800 digital systems in Canada for Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership, a joint venture between Cineplex Inc. and Empire Theatres Limited.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , all of our screens were fully outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	We maintain an investment in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Open Road Films was created to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big-budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost-effective manner, which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	Open Road Films distributed seven films and generated national box office revenues of approximately $107.0 million during 2016 and intends to distribute approximately six to eight films per year.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P36_S3	The Company has committed to a cash investment of $30.0 million in Open Road Films, and as of December 31, 2016, the Company has funded a total of $28.3 million of its initial $30.0 million commitment.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P36_S4	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Open Road Films as of December 31, 2016 was $(1.7) million .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Company is a party to a joint venture with certain exhibitors and distributors called DCDC.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	DCDC has established a satellite distribution network that distributes digital content to theatres via satellite.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	The Company has an approximate 14.6% ownership in DCDC as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	The carrying value of the Company's investment in DCDC was approximately $2.8 million as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	Finally, we maintain an investment in Atom Tickets, an internet ticketing partner of the Company.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S5	At nearly one third of our locations, Atom Tickets provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S6	The carrying value of the Company's investment in Atom Tickets was approximately $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P37_S7	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of Open Road Films, DCDC and Atom Tickets.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	FILM DISTRIBUTION Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	A strong theatrical opening often establishes a film's success and positively influences the film's potential in these downstream distribution channels.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	As the primary distribution mechanism for the public's evaluation of films, we believe that domestic theatrical distribution remains the cornerstone of a film's overall financial success.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P40_S4	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	Films are licensed from film distributors owned by major production companies and from independent film distributors that distribute films for smaller production companies.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	Film distributors typically establish geographic licensing zones and allocate each available film to one theatre within that zone.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S5	In licensing zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those films being offered and negotiating directly with the distributor.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P42_S6	In zones where there is competition, a distributor may allocate films among the exhibitors in the zone or choose to offer their films to some or all exhibitors in the zone.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	When films are licensed under the allocation process, a distributor will select an exhibitor for each film who then negotiates film rental terms directly with the distributor.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	The majority of our arrangements use a "sliding scale" formula.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	distributor or (2) the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	For fiscal 2016 , films shown from our top ten film distributors accounted for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P47_S3	Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor's motion pictures in any given year.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P47_S4	In 2016, our largest single distributor accounted for 26.8% of our box office admissions.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	CONCESSIONS In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 29.2% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	To address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S5	The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results, and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P49_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we offered an expanded menu of food in 216 locations (reaching approximately 53% of our fiscal 2016 attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 143 locations (reaching approximately 28% of our fiscal 2016 attendees), and we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 270 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 215 locations by the end of 2017.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	COMPETITION The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	We have several hundred competitors nationwide that vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P51_S3	Our competitors, including newly established motion picture exhibitors, may build new theatres or screens in areas in which we operate, which may result in increased competition and excess capacity in those areas.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P51_S4	If this occurs, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P51_S5	As one of the largest motion picture exhibitors, however, we believe that we will be able to generate economies of scale and operating efficiencies that will give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	As discussed in "Industry Overview and Trends" under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K, the domestic motion picture exhibition industry is in the process of implementing various initiatives and concepts aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	We are optimistic that these and other recent industry initiatives and trends will drive continued growth and strength for the domestic motion picture industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	To that end, our market share may be positively or negatively impacted by such initiatives and trends during any given fiscal period.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Other technologies could also have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Over the past several years, the theatrical release window has contracted to approximately three to four months.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P54_S4	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P54_S5	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	MARKETING AND ADVERTISING Currently, film distributors organize and finance multimedia advertising campaigns for major film releases.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	To market our theatres, we utilize internet, mobile and social media, print and multimedia advertising to inform our patrons of film selections and show times.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	In many of our markets, we employ special interactive marketing programs for specific films and concessions items.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S3	Our frequent moviegoer loyalty program, Regal Crown Club , is designed to actively engage our core customers and is the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S4	Through the Regal Crown Club , we seek to enhance the customer experience and increase the frequency and amounts of purchases to generate additional revenue.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S5	During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the national rollout of the new Regal Crown Club .
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S6	Members of the enhanced program can earn unlimited credits and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center where members can select the rewards of their choice.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S7	We believe these changes allow us to provide more relevant offers to our members and increase customer engagement in the program.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S8	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately 11.8 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , and these members accounted for approximately $1.1 billion of the Company's box office and concession revenues during fiscal 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S9	Our mobile ticketing application, designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their Apple iPhone or Android phone, has been downloaded approximately 6.1 million times since its fiscal 2012 launch.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S10	The application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes and special offers from Regal and the ability to purchase tickets for local theatres, thereby expediting the admissions process.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S11	Additionally, the application helps customers stay up-to-date on the latest coupons and Regal Crown Club loyalty program promotions.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P55_S12	In addition, we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs such as summer children's film series and promotions within local communities.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Information Technology ("IT") is focused on the customer experience and supporting the efficient operation of our theatres, the management of our business and other revenue-generating opportunities.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	The revenue streams generated by attendance and concession sales are fully supported by information systems to monitor cash flow and to detect fraud and inventory shrinkage.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have implemented software and hardware solutions which provide for enhanced capabilities and efficiency within our theatre operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	These solutions have enabled us to sell gift cards at various major retailers, grocery and warehouse stores and to redeem those gift cards at our theatre box offices and concession stands.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	We continue to focus on improving the customer experience of purchasing tickets by expanding our ability to sell tickets remotely via our mobile application and through our internet ticketing partners such as Fandango.com and Atom Tickets, and self-service alternatives, such as ticketing kiosks and print-at-home ticketing.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Customers can choose their preferred ticketing option, which in many cases means they can pre-purchase tickets, scan their mobile device and proceed directly to their reserved seat without waiting in line.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	In addition to providing customers the ability to pre-purchase tickets, our mobile application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, track Regal Crown Club credits and receive special offers from Regal.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	Lastly, at nearly one third of our locations, our newest ticketing partner, Atom Tickets, provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	These technologies provide a platform for delivering a quality customer experience and will drive incremental revenues and cash flows in a more cost-effective manner.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P58_S4	In addition, we continue to strategically pursue technologies to improve the services we provide to our patrons and to provide information to our management allowing them to operate our theatres efficiently.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	coordination needed to properly allocate our auditoriums between film showings and meetings and events, while also ensuring that movie audiences view the intended advertising and that revenue is allocated to the appropriate business function.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The scheduling systems also provide scheduling information electronically and automatically to media outlets, including newspapers and various online media outlets to drive attendance in our theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	The sales and attendance information collected by the theatre systems is used directly for film booking and settlement as well as provides the primary source of data for our financial systems.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Historically, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2016 , we employed approximately 25,359 persons.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Shown below are the names, ages as of December 31, 2016 , and current positions of our executive officers.

1168696_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	REGULATION The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P71_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P72_S3	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , we had total debt obligations of $2,340.1 million .
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , we had total contractual cash obligations of approximately $6,040.4 million .

If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional equity financing or sell assets.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S7	As a result, the inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S8	The agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions (including paying dividends to our stockholders) or require us not to allow specific events to occur and prescribe minimum financial maintenance requirements that we must meet.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S9	If we violate those restrictive covenants or fail to meet the minimum financial requirements contained in a debt instrument, we could be in default under that instrument, which could, in turn, result in defaults under other debt instruments.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S11	In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the agreements governing the terms of our debt obligations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If our and our subsidiaries' cash flows prove inadequate to meet our and their debt service and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our and our subsidiaries' existing or future debt, on or before maturity, sell assets, obtain additional financing or suspend the payment of dividends.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which can depend on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of, these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with the top ten film distributors accounting for approximately 95% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S7	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce our revenue.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P3_S8	We compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels during the theatrical release window.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The average theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months over the last decade.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We can provide no assurance as to the impact or timing of any material contraction to the current theatrical release window.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry has and continues to implement various initiatives, concepts, customer amenities and technological innovations aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its patrons (including, but not limited to, luxury reclining seating, enhancement of food and alcoholic beverage offerings, the installation of premium format screens, digital 3D, satellite distribution technologies and stadium seating).
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Theatres in our markets without these amenities may be more vulnerable to competition than those theatres with such amenities, and should other theatre operators choose to implement these or other initiatives in these markets, the performance of our theatres may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, while we continue to implement these and other initiatives, new innovations and technology will continue to impact our industry.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Finally, should other theatre operators embark on aggressive capital spending strategies, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We are currently the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and Attorneys General in several states and have been named as defendants in third party lawsuits related to similar matters.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are currently the subject of an investigation by the DOJ regarding potentially anticompetitive conduct and coordination among NCM, AMC, the Company and/or Cinemark, under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, we are the subject of investigations by various state attorneys general relating to our investments in various joint ventures, including NCM, as well as movie clearances whereby film distributors do not license the rights to exhibitors to play the same first-run feature length films at the same time in the same theatrical release zones.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, we have been named as defendants in lawsuits commenced by other theatre operators who claim the Company has engaged in anti-competitive conduct by virtue of these clearances.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The Company intends to cooperate with any Federal or state investigations to the extent any are undertaken.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	While we do not believe that the Company has engaged in any violation of Federal or state antitrust or competition laws related to its investments in NCM, other joint ventures, or as pertains to movie clearances, and while the Company intends to vigorously defend any allegation that it has done so, we can provide no assurances as to the scope, timing or outcome of the DOJ s, any other state or Federal governmental reviews of the Company s conduct, or any third party lawsuits initiated regarding the same or similar matters.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If we are subject to an adverse finding or ruling resulting from any of these investigations or lawsuits, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	In addition, we have already incurred substantial legal expenses related to these matters and we may incur significant additional expenditures in the future.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Furthermore, the period of time necessary to fully respond to and resolve these investigations and lawsuits is uncertain and could require significant management time and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	We may not benefit from our acquisition strategy and strategic partnerships.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S9	We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S10	In the case of acquisitions, even if we identify suitable candidates, we anticipate significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S12	As a result of this competition for limited assets, we may not succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S13	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may not be able to successfully expand our operations and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S14	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S15	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S16	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S17	If we cannot generate anticipated cash flows resulting from acquisitions or fail to realize their anticipated benefits, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P9_S18	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We also maintain theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we own approximately 19.7% of National CineMedia, and participate in other joint ventures such as DCIP, Open Road Films, AC JV, DCDC and Atom Tickets.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, Open Road Films, AC JV, DCDC and Atom Tickets or other existing or future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or state or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres or other assets in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities, pay damages and fines, or otherwise modify our normal operations as a result of our joint venture investments.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The DOJ and various state attorneys general are currently investigating our investments in our various joint ventures, including NCM, for potentially anticompetitive conduct, as described more fully herein, and until such investigations are complete, we are not able to predict their outcome.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to protect confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Economic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If economic conditions are weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Theatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe storms in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted at times when the implementation of our business strategy may require us to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	For example, our future ability to borrow on Regal Cinemas' senior credit facility or the effectiveness of our remaining and future interest rate hedging arrangements could be negatively impacted if one or more counterparties files for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fails to perform their obligations thereunder.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P14_S8	All of these factors could adversely affect our credit ratings, the market price of our Class A common stock and our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We depend on our senior management.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, including Amy Miles, our Chief Executive Officer.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We cannot assure you that we would be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services were no longer available.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The loss of any member of senior management could adversely affect our ability to effectively pursue our business strategy.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A significant portion of our theatre level employees are paid at or slightly above the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our theatres must comply with the ADA to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The interests of our controlling stockholder may conflict with your interests.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Anschutz Corporation owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our Class A common stock has one vote per share while our Class B common stock has ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	As a result, as of December 31, 2016 , The Anschutz Corporation controlled approximately 69.0% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	For as long as The Anschutz Corporation continues to own shares of common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our common stock, it will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors, effect stockholder actions by written consent in lieu of stockholder meetings and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The Anschutz Corporation will also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control, and could take other actions that might be desirable to The Anschutz Corporation but not to other stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, The Anschutz Corporation and its affiliates have controlling interests in companies in related and unrelated industries, including interests in the sports, motion picture production and music entertainment industries.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	In the future, it may combine our company with one or more of its other holdings.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Substantial sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We cannot predict the effect, if any, that open-market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, including by the The Anschutz Corporation or its affiliates, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As of February 20, 2017 , we had outstanding 23,708,639 shares of Class B common stock that may convert into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, all of which shares of common stock constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradable.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, The Anschutz Corporation and its affiliates are able to sell their shares pursuant to the registration rights that we have granted and may choose to do so at any time.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	To that end, on August 2, 2016, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated and The Anschutz Corporation and certain of its affiliates named therein (the Selling Stockholders ).
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell 13,000,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated at a price of $21.60 per share.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, on November 17, 2016, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with UBS Securities LLC and the Selling Stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell 13,000,000 shares of the Company s Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to UBS Securities LLC at a price of $22.95 per share.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sales of the shares by the Selling Stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	November 17, 2016, respectively, to the prospectus dated August 28, 2015 that was included in the Company s effective shelf registration statement (Reg.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	No. 333-206656) relating to shares of the Company s Class A common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The Selling Stockholders owned 18,440,000 shares of our issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 13.9% of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2016, which together with the 23,708,639 shares of our Class B common stock owned by the Selling Stockholders, represents approximately 69.0% of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of December 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We cannot predict whether substantial amounts of our Class A common stock will be sold in the open market in anticipation of, or following, any divestiture by The Anschutz Corporation or our directors or executive officers of their shares of our common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain anti-takeover protections, which may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders (unless otherwise required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock, either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote, even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Our issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S9	The issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P21_S10	For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are a holding company dependent on our subsidiaries for our ability to service our debt and pay our dividends.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We are a holding company with no operations of our own.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Consequently, our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' debt and pay dividends on our common stock is dependent upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Any distribution of earnings to us from our subsidiaries, or advances or other distributions of funds by these subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory or contractual restrictions, are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and are subject to various business considerations.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization, and therefore the right of the holders of our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2022 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2023 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023"), our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes due 2025 (the "5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025") and our common stock to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors.
1168696_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us.
1168696_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 to 20 years.
1168696_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that these facilities are currently adequate for our operations.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 20, 2017 , there were approximately 238 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and one stockholder of record of our Class B common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	All shares of restricted stock are registered and will be freely tradable when the restrictions lapse, unless such shares are issued to or acquired by an affiliate of Regal, in which case the affiliate may only sell the shares subject to the volume limitations imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities Act.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividend Policy During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Fiscal 2016 Period"), Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	On February 9, 2017 , the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2017 .
1168696_17_ITEM5_P3_S2	Declared dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P3_S3	We, at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P3_S4	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P3_S5	For a description of the loan agreement restrictions on the payment of dividends, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None.
1168696_17_ITEM5_P5_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (2) Includes the December 15, 2014 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P0_S1	(3) Includes the December 27, 2012 payment of the $1.00 extraordinary cash dividend paid on each share of Class A and Class B common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P0_S2	(4) During the quarter ended September 26, 2013, we redeemed 2.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which the Company sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $17.79 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by approximately $10.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P0_S3	The Company received approximately $40.9 million in proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $30.9 million.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P0_S4	We accounted for these transactions as a proportionate decrease in the Company's Initial Investment Tranche and Additional Investments Tranche and decreased our ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P0_S5	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	(5) During the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015, December 26, 2013, and December 27, 2012, we recorded impairment charges of $9.6 million, $15.6 million, $5.6 million, $9.5 million, and $11.1 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	(6) In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest , which intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S3	Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S4	ASU 2015-03 requires that they be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S5	The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S6	ASU 2015-03 is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P1_S7	The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	million , $28.0 million, $26.1 million and $20.0 million as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015, December 26, 2013, and December 27, 2012, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview and Basis of Presentation We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate one of the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the United States, consisting of 7,267 screens in 561 theatres in 42 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and bulk ticket programs, various other activities in our theatres and through our relationship with National CineMedia, which focuses on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to maximize our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Historically, motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday season.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	We evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions, which include those related to property and equipment, goodwill, deferred revenue pertaining to gift card and bulk ticket sales, income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	The Company provides assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P9_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firms.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal 2016 indicated that the carrying value of one of our reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an estimated useful life of 30 years.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	With respect to equipment (e.g., concession stand, point-of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have longer useful economic lives, and their depreciable lives (10-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S6	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S7	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolete, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S8	Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S9	Historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S10	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S11	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P13_S12	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , we recorded impairment charges of $9.6 million , $15.6 million and $5.6 million , respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres we deemed other than temporary.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 , consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $230.7 million , representing 7.2% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately $14.9 million, or 6.5%.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $17.1 million, or 7.4%.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P17_S8	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	For fiscal 2016 , our provision for income taxes was $111.2 million .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained, the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 39.5% to 40.5% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $2.9 million.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	As noted in our significant accounting policies for "Revenue Recognition" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to cash received from the sale of bulk tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The Company recognizes revenue associated with bulk tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience, when the likelihood of redemption is remote, and when there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card and bulk ticket items to the relevant jurisdiction.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of historical redemption trends and considers various factors including the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Significant Events and Fiscal 2017 Outlook During the Fiscal 2016 Period , the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (" Fiscal 2015 Period ") and the fifty-three week fiscal year ended January 1, 2015 (" Fiscal 2014 Period "), the Company entered into various investing and financing transactions which are more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	During the Fiscal 2016 Period, we continued to make progress with respect to our business strategy as follows:
1168696_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	We demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	During the Fiscal 2016 Period , we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We continued to actively manage our asset base during the Fiscal 2016 Period by opening two theatres with 19 screens, reopening five screens at an existing theatre and closing 13 theatres and 118 screens, ending the Fiscal 2016 Period with 561 theatres and 7,267 screens.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	We continued to embrace innovative concepts that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company and deliver a premium movie-going experience for our customers on several complementary fronts:
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	First, we continued to improve customer amenities, primarily through the installation of luxury reclining seats.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	With respect to our luxury reclining seating initiative, as of December 31, 2016, we offered luxury reclining seating in 1,369 auditoriums at 113 theatre locations.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	We expect to install luxury reclining seating in approximately 40-45 locations during 2017 and expect to outfit approximately 45% of the total screens in our circuit by the end of 2019.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by contributions from our theatre landlords.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	Second, to address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S5	The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results, and we expect to continue to invest in such offerings in our theatres.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we offered an expanded menu of food in 216 locations (reaching approximately 53% of our fiscal 2016 attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 143 locations (reaching approximately 28% of our fiscal 2016 attendees), and we expect to offer an expanded menu of food in approximately 270 locations and alcoholic beverages in approximately 215 locations by the end of 2017.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S7	Third, we continued to implement various customer engagement initiatives aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for our customers in order to better compete for patrons and build brand loyalty.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S8	For example, we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program, named the Regal Crown Club , to actively engage our core customers.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S9	During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the national rollout of the new Regal Crown Club .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S10	Members of the enhanced program can earn unlimited credits and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center where members can select the rewards of their choice.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S11	We believe these changes allow us to offer more relevant offers to our members and increase customer engagement in the program.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S12	As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 11.8 million active members in the Regal Crown Club , making it the largest loyalty program in our industry.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S13	In addition, we continued to develop and enhance other customer engagement initiatives such as mobile ticketing applications, internet ticketing, social media and other marketing initiatives.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S14	For example, we have improved the customer experience of purchasing tickets by expanding our ability to sell tickets remotely via our mobile application and through our internet ticketing partners such as Fandango.com and Atom Tickets.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S15	Customers can choose their preferred ticketing option, which in many cases means they can pre-purchase tickets, scan their mobile device and proceed directly to their reserved seat without waiting in line.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S16	In addition to providing customers the ability to pre-purchase tickets, our mobile application provides customers the ability to find films, movie information, showtimes, track Regal Crown Club credits and receive special offers from Regal.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S17	Finally, at nearly one third of our locations, our newest ticketing partner, Atom Tickets, provides our patrons the ability to bypass concession stand lines by pre-purchasing concession items via their mobile device.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S18	We believe these technologies provide a platform for delivering a quality customer experience and will drive incremental revenues and cash flows in a more cost-effective manner.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P28_S19	Finally, our IMAX digital projection systems and our proprietary large screen format, RPX SM , offer our patrons all-digital, large format premium experiences and generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the Company.

1168696_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The quarterly financial data as of each period presented below have been derived from Regal's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for those periods.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	The comparability of our results between quarters is impacted by certain factors described below and to a lesser extent, seasonality.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Regal and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) As described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on December 2, 2016, Regal Cinemas entered into a permitted secured refinancing agreement with REH, the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG and the lenders party thereto.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The permitted secured refinancing agreement further amends the Amended Senior Credit Facility, which was amended by the June 2016 Refinancing Agreement described in (2) below.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	In connection with the execution of the permitted secured refinancing agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.4 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	(2) As described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on June 1, 2016, Regal Cinemas entered into a permitted secured refinancing agreement with REH, the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG and the lenders party thereto.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	In connection with the execution of the permitted secured refinancing agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	(3) As described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on April 2, 2015, Regal Cinemas entered into a seventh amended and restated credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG as Administrative Agent and the lenders party thereto which amended, restated and refinanced the sixth amended and restated credit agreement.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	As a result of the amendment, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $5.7 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	(4) During the eight quarters ended December 31, 2016 , we recorded impairment charges of $3.2 million, $3.4 million, $0.8 million, $2.2 million, $4.5 million, $9.2 million, $1.9 million, $0.0 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources On a consolidated basis, we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes related to corporate operations, debt service and the Company's dividend payments.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under the Amended Senior Credit Facility described below.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Under the terms of the Amended Senior Credit Facility, Regal Cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to Regal, its indirect parent.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	Since Regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries, this restriction could impact Regal's ability to effect future debt or dividend payments, pay corporate expenses, repurchase or retire for cash its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and its 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	In addition, as described further below, the indentures under which the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023, and the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 are issued limit the Company's (and its restricted subsidiaries') ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock, purchase or redeem capital stock, make loans or advances to its subsidiaries, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs, rent and occupancy and payroll.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	Film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within 30 days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the Company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately 30 to 35 days from purchase.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	Our current liabilities include items that will become due within 12 months.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	In addition, from time to time, we use cash from operations to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and to fund dividends in excess of cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales).
1168696_17_ITEM7_P55_S5	As a result, at any given time, our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $410.5 million , $434.4 million and $349.1 million for the Fiscal 2016 Period, the Fiscal 2015 Period and the Fiscal 2014 Period, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2016 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2015 Period was caused by a negative fluctuation in working capital activity (primarily related to the timing of vendor payments, including film payables, as a result of increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2015 Period), partially offset by an increase in landlord contributions and an increase in net income excluding non-cash items.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	The increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period was caused by a positive fluctuation in working capital activity (primarily related to the timing of vendor payments, including film payables, as a result of increased attendance and admissions revenues at our theatres during the latter part of the Fiscal 2015 Period), an increase in landlord contributions and an increase in net income excluding non-cash items.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres, new theatre construction, strategic partnerships, the addition of luxury amenities in select theatres, other upgrades to the Company s theatre facilities and replacing equipment.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	We fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows, cash on hand, landlord contributions, proceeds from the disposition of assets and financing activities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	We intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects, with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non-maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the Company s internal rate of return targets.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	We currently expect capital expenditures (net of proceeds from asset sales and landlord contributions) for theatre development, expansion, upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately $130.0 million to $145.0 million in fiscal year 2017, exclusive of acquisitions.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	During the Fiscal 2016 Period, we received approximately 0.7 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S3	This transaction caused a proportionate increase in the Company's ownership share in National CineMedia to approximately 27.1 million common units.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S4	On a fully diluted basis, we own a 19.7% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S5	During the Fiscal 2016 Period, RealD, Inc. stockholders approved an all-cash merger whereby Rizvi Traverse Management, LLC acquired RealD, Inc. for $11.00 per share.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S6	Under the terms of the merger agreement, RealD, Inc. shareholders received $11.00 in cash for each share of RealD, Inc. s common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S7	During the Fiscal 2016 Period, the Company received approximately $3.6 million in cash consideration for its remaining 322,780 RealD, Inc. common shares.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S8	As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $1.0 million during the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S9	Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $223.6 million , $183.3 million and $150.4 million for the Fiscal 2016 Period, the Fiscal 2015 Period and the Fiscal 2014 Period, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S10	The $40.3 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2016 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2015 Period, was primarily attributable to a $39.8 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) and higher capital investments in certain non-consolidated entities, partially offset by the impact of $9.2 million of cash used for a fiscal 2015 acquisition and $3.6 million in proceeds received related to the sale of RealD, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P59_S11	The $32.9 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2015 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period, was primarily attributable to a $18.6 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) during the Fiscal 2015 Period, $9.2 million of cash used for the acquisition of five theatres with 61 screens from entities affiliated with Georgia Theatre Company, and the impact of $6.0 million in proceeds received related to the sale of RealD, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2014 Period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Financing Activities As described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas entered into a permitted secured refinancing agreement with REH, the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG and the lenders party thereto (the "June 2016 Refinancing Agreement").
1168696_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Pursuant to the June 2016 Refinancing Agreement, Regal Cinemas consummated a permitted secured refinancing of the Term Facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility, which had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $958.5 million , and in accordance therewith, received term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $958.5 million with a final maturity date in April 2022.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Together with other amounts provided by Regal Cinemas, proceeds of the term loans were applied to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Term Facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	In connection with the execution of the June 2016 Refinancing Agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	On December 2, 2016, Regal Cinemas entered into a permitted secured refinancing agreement (the December 2016 Refinancing Agreement ) with REH, the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG and the lenders party thereto.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	The December 2016 Refinancing Agreement further amends the Amended Senior Credit Facility, which was amended by the June 2016 Refinancing Agreement.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Pursuant to the December 2016 Refinancing Agreement, Regal Cinemas consummated a permitted secured refinancing of the Term Facility, which had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $956.1 million , and in accordance therewith, the Lenders advanced term loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $956.1 million with a final maturity date in April 2022 (the New Term Loans ).
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Together with other amounts provided by Regal Cinemas, proceeds of the New Term Loans were applied to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the existing term facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility in effect immediately prior to the making of the New Term Loans.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	The New Term Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the New Term Loans, with the balance payable on the maturity date of the New Term Loans.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	The December 2016 Refinancing Agreement also amends the Amended Senior Credit Facility by reducing the interest rate on the New Term Loans, by providing, at Regal Cinemas option, either a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S4	Such applicable margin will be either 1.50% in the case of base rate loans or 2.50% in the case of LIBOR rate loans.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S5	The December 2016 Refinancing Agreement also provides for a 1% prepayment premium applicable in the event that Regal Cinemas enters into a refinancing or amendment of the New Term Loans on or prior to the sixth-month anniversary of the closing of the December 2016 Refinancing Agreement that, in either case, has the effect of reducing the interest rate on the New Term Loans.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P62_S6	In connection with the execution of the December 2016 Refinancing Agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.4 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $954.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the New Term Loans, $775.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the Revolving Facility.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	The significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	However, companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have, in the opinion of certain rating agencies, the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims, while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P64_S3	Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the Company's current ratings will continue for any given period of time.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P64_S4	An upgrade or downgrade of the Company's debt ratings, depending on the extent, could affect the cost to borrow funds.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P64_S5	There were no upgrades or downgrades to the Company's debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	During the Fiscal 2016 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	On February 9, 2017 , the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), payable on March 15, 2017 to stockholders of record on March 3, 2017 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	Declared dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	We, at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock for the foreseeable future.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S4	The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S5	Net cash flows provided used in financing activities were approximately $160.0 million , $178.6 million and $332.5 million for the Fiscal 2016 Period, the Fiscal 2015 Period and the Fiscal 2014 Period, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S6	The net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2016 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2015 Period of $18.6 million was primarily attributable to the net impact of the Amended Senior Credit Facility refinancing effected during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P65_S7	The net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2015 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2014 Period of $153.9 million was primarily attributable to a $155.7 million decrease in dividends paid to stockholders during the 2015 Fiscal Period as compared to the 2014 Fiscal Period, lower payments on long-term obligations and landlord contributions received in connection with amended lease financing arrangements, partially offset by the net impact of the Amended Senior Credit Facility refinancing effected during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	EBITDA Net income attributable to controlling interest adjusted for interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") was approximately $640.4 million , $599.9 million and $512.7 million for the Fiscal 2016 Period, the Fiscal 2015 Period and the Fiscal 2014 Period, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The Company uses EBITDA as a supplemental liquidity and performance measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity, excluding the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, for servicing our debt, paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs, prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors for these purposes as well.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by or used in operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, since it omits the impact of interest, taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash (such as receivables, payables and inventories) as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items (such as long-term loss accruals and deferred items).
1168696_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Because EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized, which assets will often have to be replaced in the future.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	Further, EBITDA, because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service, income taxes, cash dividends, capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	Nonetheless, EBITDA is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors, rating agencies and the banking community, all of whom believe, and we concur, that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P67_S4	We also evaluate EBITDA because it is clear that movements in this non-GAAP measure impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	EBITDA, as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	A reconciliation of net income attributable to controlling interest to EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows (in millions):
1168696_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Interest Rate Swaps As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2016 , the Company maintained one effective hedging relationship via one distinct interest rate swap agreement (maturity date of June 30, 2018), which requires Regal Cinemas to pay interest at a fixed rate of 2.165% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	This interest rate swap agreement is designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately 4.7% as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company's interest rate swap fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Sale-Leaseback Transactions For information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions, refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The Company has assumed long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Other than the operating leases that are detailed below, the Company does not utilize variable interest entities or any other form of off-balance sheet financing.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company's estimated contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next several periods are as follows (in millions):
1168696_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our Amended Senior Credit Facility provides for mandatory prepayments under certain scenarios.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our long-term debt obligations and related matters.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	(2) Future interest payments on the Company's unhedged debt obligations as of December 31, 2016 (consisting of approximately $756.1 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Loans, $775.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and approximately $4.1 million of other debt obligations) are based on the stated fixed rate or in the case of the $756.1 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Loans, the current interest rate specified in our Amended Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 (3.27%).
1168696_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Future interest payments are calculated based on interest rates implicit in the underlying leases, which have a weighted average interest rate of 11.23%, maturing in various installments through 2028.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	(4) Includes estimated capital expenditures and investments to which we were contractually obligated as of December 31, 2016 , including improvements associated with existing theatres (including luxury reclining seating), the construction of new theatres and investments in non-consolidated entities.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	Does not include non-committed capital expenditures.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S3	Our operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) The table does not include approximately $6.3 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized state tax benefits because the timing of the related payments was not reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S4	In addition, as of December 31, 2016 , Regal Cinemas had approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the $85.0 million Revolving Facility.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S5	Regal Cinemas also maintains a sublimit within the Revolving Facility of $10.0 million for short-term loans and $30.0 million for letters of credit.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P77_S6	We believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our Revolving Facility will be adequate for the Company to execute its business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for the next 12 months.
1168696_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the operating leases detailed above in this Form 10-K, under the heading "Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments," the Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.

1168696_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates.
1168696_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Borrowings under the New Term Loans bear interest, at Regal Cinemas option, at either a base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin.
1168696_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Under the terms of the Company's effective interest rate swap agreement (which hedges an aggregate of $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations as of December 31, 2016 ) described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Regal Cinemas pays interest at a fixed rate of 2.165% and receives interest at a variable rate.
1168696_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , borrowings of $954.7 million (net of debt discount) and $958.8 million (net of debt discount), respectively, were outstanding under the New Term Loans and the Prior Term Facility at an effective interest rate of 3.56% (as of December 31, 2016 ) and 4.17% (as of December 31, 2015), respectively, after the impact of interest rate swaps is taken into account.
1168696_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A hypothetical change of 10% in the Company's effective interest rate under the New Term Loans as of December 31, 2016 , would increase or decrease interest expense by $3.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, our management believes that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2016 .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Regal Entertainment Group: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	We also have audited Regal Entertainment Group s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	Regal Entertainment Group s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S6	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P3_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	Also in our opinion, Regal Entertainment Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

1168696_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company controls are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P17_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P17_S4	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	Other operating revenues consist primarily of product advertising (including vendor marketing programs) and other ancillary revenues that are recognized as income in the period earned.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company generally recognizes payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor programs as revenue in the periods in which the advertising is displayed or when the related impressions are delivered.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P18_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P18_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to amounts received for agreeing to the 2007 National CineMedia exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") modification, amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement described in Note 4 "Investments," and amounts received from the sale of bulk tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company recognizes revenue associated with bulk tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of actual historical redemption trends.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of 3 months or less to be cash equivalents.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the Company held substantially all of its cash in temporary cash investments in the form of certificates of deposit and variable rate investment accounts with major financial institutions.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company states inventories on the basis of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost, which is not in excess of net realizable value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company states property and equipment at cost.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the Company capitalized approximately $8.0 million and $12.6 million , respectively, of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company also capitalizes certain direct external costs associated with software developed for internal use after the preliminary software project stage is completed and Company management has authorized further funding for a software project and it is deemed probable of completion.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	The Company capitalizes these external software development costs only until the point at which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company records depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1168696_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , included in property and equipment is $190.6 million and $185.9 million of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $118.0 million and $104.1 million , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets (including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities as described further below) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company considers historical theatre level cash flows, estimated future theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, intangible asset carrying values, the age of the theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent pricing changes, strategic initiatives, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of whether or not a triggering event has occurred that indicates impairment of individual theatre assets may be necessary.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Significant judgment is involved in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, estimating future cash flows and determining fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Triggering events identified resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $9.6 million , $15.6 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Certain leases for our theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P33_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	None of our lease agreements require us to return the leased property to the lessor in its original condition (allowing for normal wear and tear) or to remove leasehold improvements at our cost.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company accounts for lease incentive payments received from a landlord in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Lease Incentives , and records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the base term of the lease.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was approximately $327.0 million and $328.7 million , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	As part of the Company s ongoing operations, we may close certain theatres within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the theatre or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Additionally, we generally abandon certain assets associated with a closed theatre, primarily leasehold improvements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, goodwill associated with that business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	We evaluate whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business on the date of closure.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	Generally, on the date of closure, the closed theatre does not constitute a business because the Company retains assets and processes on that date essential to the operation of the theatre.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	These assets and processes are significant missing elements impeding the operation of a business.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P50_S4	Accordingly, when closing individual theatres, we generally do not include goodwill in the calculation of any gain or loss on disposal of the related assets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2016 indicated that the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 indicated that the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , intangible assets totaled $66.8 million and $67.1 million , respectively, before accumulated amortization of $20.8 million and $16.9 million , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	Such intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	The Company's identifiable intangible assets substantially consist of favorable leases acquired in connection with various acquisitions since fiscal 2008.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P52_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , the Company recognized $3.8 million , $3.7 million and $3.7 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 31, 2016 is projected below (in millions):
1168696_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company recorded a favorable lease impairment charge of approximately $0.3 million related to a theatre closure.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2015 or January 1, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Debt acquisition costs are deferred and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related agreements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest , which intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	ASU 2015-03 requires that they be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S4	The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S5	ASU 2015-03 is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P55_S6	The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt, net of accumulated amortization, were $25.8 million and $30.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company primarily accounts for its investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting and has recorded the investments within "Other Non-Current Assets" and "Other Non-Current Liabilities" as applicable in its consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company records equity in earnings and losses of these entities in its consolidated statements of income.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company holds a 19.7% interest in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM"), a 46.7% interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC, a 50% interest in Open Road Films, a 32% interest in AC JV, LLC and a 14.6% interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition (each as described further under Note 4 "Investments").
1168696_17_ITEM8_P57_S3	In addition, as described further under Note 4 "Investments," the Company holds an equity investment in Atom Tickets, LLC, an internet ticketing partner of the Company.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P57_S4	Such investment is accounted for under the cost method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P57_S5	The carrying value of the Company's investment in these entities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was approximately $367.7 million and $321.8 million , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	changes in reserves for product liability, loss of a principal customer, negative operating cash flows or working capital deficiencies and the recording of an impairment charge by the investee for goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	There was no impairment of the Company's investments during the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P61_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations under Regal Cinemas' Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Certain of these interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated or de-designated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S4	See Note 14 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company s interest rate swaps fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S5	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S6	The counterparties to the Company s interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P65_S7	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Deferred revenue relates primarily to the amount we received for agreeing to the 2007 ESA modification, amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia, cash received from the sale of bulk tickets and gift cards, and amounts received in connection with vendor marketing programs.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification is being amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement are being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	deferred revenue, respectively, related to the ESA was recorded as components of current and non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , approximately $175.6 million and $188.5 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the gift cards and bulk tickets was recorded as a component of current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Generally, less than one - third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within 2 to 3 months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at the Company's theatres and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	Start-up costs associated with a new theatre are also expensed as incurred.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock And Share-Based Compensation," we apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, the Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	The alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies that could be recognized subsequent to the adoption of ASC Subtopic 718-10.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, deferred revenue, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P75_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , the Company managed its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	Total comprehensive income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was $171.3 million , $152.6 million and $106.1 million , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangement, the change in fair value of available for sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments), the reclassification adjustment for gain on sale of available for sale securities recognized in net income and the change in fair value of equity method investee interest rate swap transactions during each of the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which provides guidance on evaluating whether a reporting entity should consolidate certain legal entities.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	Further, the amendments eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, as well as affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	A reporting entity may apply the amendments using a modified retrospective approach or a full retrospective application.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company's adoption of ASU 2015-02 during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	As further described above in this Note 2 under "Debt Acquisition Costs," in April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt, net of accumulated amortization, were $25.8 million and $30.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	ASU 2015-15 adds clarification to the guidance presented in ASU 2015-03, as that guidance did not address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	We adopted ASU 2015-15 along with the original guidance in ASU 2015-03 discussed above.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	The guidance in ASU 2015-15 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which requires the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	The amendments in ASU 2015-17 may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	We adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and elected the prospective approach.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P86_S4	Therefore, deferred taxes as of December 31, 2016 are recorded as long-term deferred tax assets and long-term deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P86_S5	Balances as of December 31, 2015 have not been recast.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	However, the standard was deferred by ASU 2015-14, issued by the FASB in August 2015, and is now effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P88_S2	The Company has selected the modified retrospective method for adoption of ASU 2014-09 and is continuing to further evaluate the full impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P88_S3	To that end, the Company has conducted initial analyses, developed project management relative to the process of adopting ASU 2014-09, and is currently completing detailed contract reviews to determine necessary adjustments to existing accounting policies and to support an evaluation of the standard s impact on the Company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P89_S3	The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and believes that the significance of its future minimum rental payments will result in a material increase in ROU assets and lease liabilities.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P91_S2	ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P91_S3	The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	The aggregate net cash purchase price was allocated to the identifiable assets acquired for each of the respective theatre locations based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	The allocation of the purchase price is based on management s judgment after evaluating several factors.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The results of operations of the five acquired theatres have been included in the Company s consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the acquisition date.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following is a summary of the allocation of the aggregate net cash purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets acquired that have been recognized by the Company in its consolidated balance sheet as of the date of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	National CineMedia provides in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which include us, AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S3	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S4	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_17_ITEM8_P110_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one -to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO and receipt of proceeds in excess of our investment balance, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	Accordingly, we will not provide for any additional losses, as we have not guaranteed obligations of National CineMedia and we are not otherwise committed to provide further financial support for National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P111_S3	Until such time, equity in earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P111_S4	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.0756 payment per patron for fiscal 2016 and increases by 8% every 5 years starting at the end of fiscal 2011, a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which increases by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $1,241 for fiscal 2016) and an additional payment per digital screen of $638 for fiscal 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S2	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S3	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S4	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S5	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S6	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P114_S7	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 20 years .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million , which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	Under the units of revenue method, amortization for a period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the ESA modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P117_S2	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P117_S3	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P117_S4	If the Company elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Additional Investments Tranche at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for the Additional Investments Tranche common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a non-operating gain or loss.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 31, 2016 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 12.4 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition ) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P119_S2	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P119_S3	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	The NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in Regal's proportionate share of tax basis in NCM Inc.'s tangible and intangible assets.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	On the IPO date, NCM, Inc., the Company, AMC and Cinemark entered into a tax receivable agreement.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P120_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, NCM, Inc. will make cash payments to us, AMC and Cinemark in amounts equal to 90% of NCM, Inc.'s actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the intangible assets described above.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax will be computed by comparing NCM, Inc.'s actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NCM, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase in NCM Inc.'s proportionate share of tax basis in NCM's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P121_S1	The tax receivable agreement shall generally apply to NCM, Inc.'s taxable years up to and including the 30 t h anniversary date of the NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Company accounts for its investment in National CineMedia following the equity method of accounting and such investment is included as a component of "Other Non-Current Assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	On January 21, 2016, after an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered a Temporary Injunction Order ( TIO ) which prohibits the Company from (i) requesting that movie studios grant it exclusive film licenses that would exclude iPic from licensing the same film at its Houston theatre; (ii) indicating to a studio that it will not play a film at any of its theatres if the studio licenses the film to iPic s Houston theatre; and (iii) communicating with the AMC Companies or coordinating their respective communications with any studio, with regard to preventing iPic from receiving licenses to first-run films to exhibit at iPic s Houston theatre.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P224_S1	On February 4, 2016, Regal filed a notice of appeal regarding the TIO, and on September 29, 2016, the Texas First Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's order.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P224_S2	The district court has scheduled trial for March 27, 2017.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P224_S3	Management believes that the allegations and claims are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend the Company.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	In situations where management believes that a loss arising from proceedings described herein is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no amount within the range is more probable than another.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P225_S1	As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these proceedings is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P225_S2	The amounts reserved for such proceedings totaled approximately $3.5 million and $4.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P225_S3	Management believes any additional liability with respect to these claims and disputes will not be material in the aggregate to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P225_S4	Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the Company believes the risk of loss is more than slight.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (iv) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (v) there are novel legal issues presented.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P226_S1	However, for these cases, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the Company s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P227_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	The Company intends to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth above, does not currently anticipate that compliance will require the Company to expend substantial funds.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P272_S0	The Company sponsors an employee benefit plan, the Regal Entertainment Group 401(k) Plan (the "401k Plan") under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the benefit of substantially all employees.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P272_S1	The 401k Plan provides that participants may contribute up to 50% of their compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P272_S2	The 401k Plan currently matches an amount equal to 100% of the first 3% of the participant's contributions and 50% of the next 2% of the participant's contributions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P273_S0	Employee contributions are invested in various investment funds based upon elections made by the employee.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P276_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P277_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P277_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P278_S0	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common stock options, or vesting of restricted stock and performance share units.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P278_S1	The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock and performance share units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P278_S2	In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P279_S0	The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P279_S1	The earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P279_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P279_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P280_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share and per share data):
1168696_17_ITEM8_P281_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations under Regal Cinemas' Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P281_S1	Certain of these interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability, with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P281_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P281_S3	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated or de-designated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P281_S4	See Note 14 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company s interest rate swaps fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P282_S0	Below is a summary of Regal Cinemas' current interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2016 :
1168696_17_ITEM8_P283_S0	On April 2, 2015, Regal Cinemas amended two of its existing interest rate swap agreements originally designated as cash flow hedges on $350.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P283_S1	Since the terms of the interest rate swaps designated in the original cash flow hedge relationships changed with these amendments, we de-designated the original hedge relationships and re-designated the amended interest rate swaps in new cash flow hedge relationships as of the amendment date of April 2, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P284_S0	On December 31, 2016, one of these interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge $150.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P285_S0	No amendments or modifications were made to two other interest swap agreements (originally designated to hedge $300.0 million of variable rate debt obligations), existing as of April 2, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P285_S1	Since such interest rate swaps no longer met the highly effective qualification for cash flow hedge accounting, the two hedge relationships were de-designated effective April 2, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P285_S2	Accordingly, since the interest rate swaps no longer qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the change in their fair values since de-designation was recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of interest expense during the period of change.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P286_S0	On June 30, 2015, one of these interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P286_S1	The remaining interest rate swap agreement designated to hedge $100.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired on December 31, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P287_S0	The following tables show the effective portion of gains and losses on derivative instruments designated and qualifying in cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense for the periods indicated (in millions):
1168696_17_ITEM8_P288_S0	________________________________ (1) We estimate that $0.9 million of deferred pre-tax losses attributable to these interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings as interest expense during the next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions occur.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P289_S0	The changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net associated with the Company s interest rate swap arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 , and January 1, 2015 were as follows (in millions):

1168696_17_ITEM8_P291_S0	________________________________ (1) Amounts represent the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives and are recorded as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P292_S0	On December 31, 2016, one of these interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge $150.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P293_S0	(2) Amounts represent the change in fair value of the former hedging derivatives and are recorded as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements from the de-designation date of April 2, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P294_S0	On June 30, 2015, one of these interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P294_S1	The remaining interest rate swap agreement designated to hedge $100.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired on December 31, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P295_S0	Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P295_S1	The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P296_S0	The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P296_S1	Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:
1168696_17_ITEM8_P297_S0	Level 1 Inputs: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P298_S0	Level 2 Inputs: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P299_S0	Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P300_S0	The following tables summarize the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 :
1168696_17_ITEM8_P301_S0	The fair value of the RealD, Inc. shares was determined using RealD, Inc. s publicly traded common stock price (Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy) of $10.55 per share as of December 31, 2015.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P302_S0	On February 24, 2016, RealD, Inc. stockholders approved an all-cash merger whereby Rizvi Traverse Management, LLC acquired RealD, Inc. for $11.00 per share.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P302_S1	Under the terms of the merger agreement, RealD, Inc. shareholders received $11.00 in cash for each share of RealD, Inc. s common stock.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P302_S2	On March 24, 2016, the Company received approximately $3.6 million in cash consideration for its remaining 322,780 RealD, Inc. common shares.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P302_S3	As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $1.0 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P303_S0	(2) The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps described in Note 13 "Derivative Instruments" is based on Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P304_S0	The counterparties to the Company s interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P304_S1	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P305_S0	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P305_S1	There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P306_S0	In addition, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P306_S1	The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument are as follows:
1168696_17_ITEM8_P307_S0	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
1168696_17_ITEM8_P308_S0	The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P309_S0	As further described in Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the Company regularly reviews long-lived assets (primarily property and equipment), intangible assets and investments in non-consolidated entities, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P309_S1	When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P310_S0	The Company s analysis relative to long-lived assets resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $9.6 million , $15.6 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P310_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres we deemed other than temporary.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P311_S0	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2016 indicated that the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P311_S1	Based on our annual impairment assessments conducted for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P311_S2	The Company did not record an impairment of any other intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016 , December 31, 2015 or January 1, 2015, respectively.

1168696_17_ITEM8_P314_S0	The fair value of the Amended Senior Credit Facility described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations," which consists of the New Term Loans and the Revolving Facility, is estimated based on quoted prices (Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P314_S1	The associated interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and are assumed to approximate fair value.
1168696_17_ITEM8_P314_S2	The fair values of the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 and the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 were estimated based on quoted prices (Level 1 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) for these issuances as of as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1168696_17_ITEM8_P315_S0	The aggregate carrying values and fair values of long-term debt at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:

1168696_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	The undersigned, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Regal Entertainment Group, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), each hereby certifies that, to his/her knowledge on the date hereof:
1168696_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	a. the Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 , filed on the date hereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report") fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and b. the information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	THE COMPANY Regal was organized on March 6, 2002 and is the parent company of Regal Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ("REH"), which is the parent company of Regal Cinemas Corporation ("Regal Cinemas") and its subsidiaries.

1168696_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	The contents of our Internet website are not incorporated into this report.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview We operate one of the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the United States, consisting of 7,322 screens in 560 theatres in 43 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2017 , with approximately 197 million attendees for the year ended December 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 ").
1168696_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 48 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P2_S3	We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P2_S4	Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to allocate capital effectively to enhance value for our stockholders.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P2_S5	This strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	million and $112.3 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	In addition, we generated $409.9 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	THEATRE OPERATIONS The following table details the number of locations and theatre screens in our theatre circuit ranked by the number of screens in each state along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2017 :
1168696_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing over 20,800 U.S. theatre screens (of which approximately 20,400 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	We receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , we held approximately 27.6 million common units of National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	On a fully diluted basis, we own a 17.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	We maintain an investment in DCIP, a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ("AMC") and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	DCIP funds the cost of digital projection equipment principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition to its U.S. digital deployment, DCIP actively manages the deployment of over 1,800 digital systems in Canada for Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership, a joint venture between Cineplex Inc. and Empire Theatres Limited.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , all of our screens were fully outfitted with digital projection systems.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	On August 4, 2017, the Company sold all of its 50% equity interest in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC, to a third party for total proceeds of approximately $14.0 million.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	In accordance with the purchase agreement, approximately $3.7 million of the net proceeds received were in satisfaction of various receivables and other amounts due to the Company related to film marketing services provided to Open Road Films prior to the closing date.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $17.8 million, representing the difference between the net proceeds received of $10.3 million (after satisfaction of the above amounts due the Company) and the carrying amount of the Company's investment in Open Road Films (approximately $(7.5) million) as of the closing date.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P9_S3	Also effective with closing, the Company and Open Road Films entered into a new marketing agreement with respect to films released by Open Road Films after the closing date.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	FILM DISTRIBUTION Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	A strong theatrical opening often establishes a film's success and positively influences the film's potential in these downstream distribution channels.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	The majority of our arrangements use a "sliding scale" formula.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor or (2) the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	For fiscal 2017, films shown from our top ten film distributors accounted for approximately 93% of our admissions revenues.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor's motion pictures in any given year.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P19_S4	In 2017, our largest single distributor accounted for 22.1% of our box office admissions.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	CONCESSIONS In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 29.4% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S4	To address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S5	The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P21_S6	As of December 31, 2017, we offered an expanded menu of food in 270 locations (reaching 63% of our attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 175 locations (reaching 38% of our attendees).
1168696_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	COMPETITION The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:
1168696_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	We have several hundred competitors nationwide that vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P23_S3	We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Over the past several years, the theatrical release window has contracted to approximately three to four months.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P25_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P25_S4	As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P25_S5	In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2017 , we employed approximately 26,000 persons.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Shown below are the names, ages and positions of our executive officers as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1168696_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	REGULATION The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
1168696_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	In some cases you can identify these forward-looking statements by words like "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of those words and other comparable words.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.
1168696_18_ITEM1_P39_S4	Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these statements as a result of certain risk factors as more fully discussed under "Risk Factors" below.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our substantial lease and debt obligations could impair our financial condition.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have substantial lease and debt obligations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If we are unable to meet our lease and debt service obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations and seek additional financing or sell assets.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	As a result, the inability to meet our lease and debt service obligations could cause us to default on those obligations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors beyond our control.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate substantial operating cash flow.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	This will depend on future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness, sell any such assets or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We depend on motion picture production and performance and our relationships with film distributors.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and commercial appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which can depend on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of, these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Consent decrees resulting from those cases effectively require major motion picture distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the film distribution business is highly concentrated, with the top ten film distributors accounting for approximately 93% of our admissions revenues during fiscal 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We are dependent on our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S6	A deterioration in our relationship with any of the major film distributors could affect our ability to negotiate film licenses on favorable terms or our ability to obtain commercially successful films and, therefore, could hurt our business and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S7	An increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods may drive down movie theatre attendance and reduce our revenue.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels during the theatrical release window.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The average theatrical release window has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months over the last decade.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We believe that a material contraction of the current theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the in-theatre motion picture offering, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We can provide no assurance as to the impact or timing of any material contraction to the current theatrical release window.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our theatres operate in a competitive environment.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive with no significant barriers to entry.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Theatres operated by national and regional circuits and by small independent exhibitors compete with our theatres, particularly with respect to film licensing, attracting patrons and developing new theatre sites.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Moviegoers are generally not brand conscious and usually choose a theatre based on its location, the films showing there and its amenities.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The motion picture exhibition industry has and continues to implement various initiatives, concepts, customer amenities and technological innovations aimed at delivering a premium movie-going experience for its patrons (including, but not limited to, luxury reclining seating, enhancement of food and alcoholic beverage offerings, the installation of premium format screens, digital 3D, 4DX, satellite distribution technologies and stadium seating).
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Theatres in our markets without these amenities may be more vulnerable to competition than those theatres with such amenities, and should other theatre operators choose to implement these or other initiatives in these markets, the performance of our theatres may be significantly and negatively impacted.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, while we continue to implement these and other initiatives, new innovations and technology will continue to impact our industry.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to respond to or invest in future technology and the changing preferences of our customers, we may not be able to compete with other exhibitors or other entertainment venues, which could also adversely affect our results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Finally, should other theatre operators embark on aggressive capital spending strategies, our attendance, revenue and income from operations per screen could decline substantially.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We are currently the subject of an investigation by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and Attorneys General in several states and have been named as defendants in third party lawsuits related to similar matters.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are currently the subject of an investigation by the DOJ regarding potentially anticompetitive conduct and coordination among NCM, AMC, the Company and/or Cinemark, under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	exhibitors to play the same first-run feature length films at the same time in the same theatrical release zones.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, in the past, we have been named as defendants in lawsuits commenced by other theatre operators who claim the Company has engaged in anti-competitive conduct by virtue of these clearances.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The Company has cooperated with the Federal and state investigations that have been undertaken.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	While we do not believe that the Company has engaged in any violation of Federal or state antitrust or competition laws related to its investments in NCM, other joint ventures, or as pertains to movie clearances, and while the Company intends to vigorously defend any allegation that it has done so, we can provide no assurances as to the scope, timing or outcome of the DOJ s, any other state or Federal governmental reviews of the Company s conduct.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are subject to an adverse finding or ruling resulting from any of these investigations, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, we have already incurred substantial legal expenses related to these matters and we may incur significant additional expenditures in the future.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Furthermore, the period of time necessary to fully respond to and resolve these investigations is uncertain and could require significant management time and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We may not benefit from our acquisition strategy and strategic partnerships.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Identifying suitable acquisition candidates and partnership opportunities may be difficult.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S9	In the case of acquisitions, even if we are able to identify suitable candidates, there can be significant competition from other motion picture exhibitors and financial buyers when trying to acquire these candidates, and there can be no assurances that the Company would be able to acquire such candidates at reasonable prices or on favorable terms.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Moreover, some of these possible buyers may be stronger financially than we are.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S11	As a result of this competition for limited assets, there is no assurance that the Company could succeed in acquiring suitable candidates or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P10_S12	If we cannot identify or successfully acquire suitable acquisition candidates, there is no assurance that the Company could successfully expand its operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we cannot generate anticipated cash flows resulting from acquisitions or fail to realize their anticipated benefits, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	the possibility that any acquired theatres or theatre circuit operators do not perform as expected.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We also maintain theatre-related investments and partnership opportunities that enhance and more fully leverage our asset base to improve our consolidated operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	On a fully diluted basis, we own a 17.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We also participate in other joint ventures such as DCIP, AC JV, Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition ( DCDC ) and Atom Tickets.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Risks associated with pursuing these investments and opportunities include:
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, exercise their rights in a way that prohibits us from acting in a manner which we would like or they may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or similar agreements.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Although we have not been materially constrained by our participation in National CineMedia or other joint ventures to date, no assurance can be given that the actions or decisions of other stakeholders in these ventures will not affect our investments in National CineMedia, DCIP, AC JV, DCDC and Atom Tickets or other existing or future ventures in a way that hinders our corporate objectives or reduces any anticipated improvements to our operating results and free cash flow.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In addition, any acquisitions or partnership opportunities are subject to the risk that the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or state or foreign competition authorities may require us to dispose of existing or acquired theatres or other assets in order to complete acquisition and partnership opportunities, pay damages and fines, or otherwise modify our normal operations as a result of our joint venture investments.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The DOJ and various state attorneys general are currently investigating our investments in our various joint ventures, including NCM, for potentially anticompetitive conduct, as described more fully herein, and until such investigations are complete, we are not able to predict their outcome.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Information systems are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists, employee error or misconduct, viruses and other catastrophic events, leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information and exposing us to litigation that could adversely affect our reputation.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to protect confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased operating costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Economic, political and social conditions could materially affect our business by reducing consumer spending on movie attendance or could have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We depend on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, theme parks, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Motion picture theatre attendance may be affected by negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	A prolonged reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general may affect the demand for motion pictures or severely impact the motion picture production industry, which, in turn, could adversely affect our operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If economic conditions are weak or deteriorate, or if financial markets experience significant disruption, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	For example, deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets could negatively impact our business partners which may impact film production, the development of new theatres or the enhancement of existing theatres.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Theatre attendance may also be affected by political events, such as terrorist attacks on, or wars or threatened wars involving, the United States, health related epidemics and random acts of violence, any one of which could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and severe storms in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	All of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	A significant portion of our theatre level employees are paid at or slightly above the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our theatres must comply with the ADA to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations.
1168696_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
1168696_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The majority of our leased theatres are subject to lease agreements with original terms of 15 to 20 years or more and, in most cases, renewal options for up to an additional 10 to 20 years.
1168696_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	These leases provide for minimum annual rentals and the renewal options generally provide for rent increases.
1168696_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Some leases require, under specified conditions, further rental payments based on a percentage of revenues above specified amounts.
1168696_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	A significant majority of the leases are net leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes and a portion of the lessor's operating costs.
1168696_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our corporate office is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.
1168696_18_ITEM2_P0_S5	We believe that these facilities are currently adequate for our operations.
1168696_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	In addition, on January 29, 2018 a purported class action complaint relating to the Merger, captioned Baldassano v. Regal Entertainment Group et al., Case No. 195178-3, was filed on behalf of the stockholders against members of the board of directors of the Company, the Company, Cineworld, US Holdco and Merger Sub in the Chancery Court for Knox County, Tennessee in the Sixth Judicial District at Knoxville (the Action ).
1168696_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Action alleged that the board of directors of the Company breached its fiduciary duties to the stockholders by means of (A) agreeing to an allegedly unfair price in the proposed merger and (B) allegedly engineering a transaction to benefit themselves and/or Cineworld without regard to the Company s stockholders.
1168696_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaint also generally asserted that the Company, Cineworld, US Holdco and Merger Sub aided and abetted the board of directors breach of its fiduciary duties.
1168696_18_ITEM3_P0_S3	The Action sought, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, rescind the Merger Agreement (to the extent the Merger had already been consummated), damages, and attorneys fees and costs.
1168696_18_ITEM3_P0_S4	On February 12, 2018, the Company and the plaintiff entered into a memorandum of understanding in which the plaintiff agreed to dismiss his claims with prejudice, and to dismiss claims asserted on behalf of the putative class without prejudice, in return for the Company s agreement to make certain supplemental disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The following table sets forth the historical high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange for the fiscal periods indicated.
1168696_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	On February 28, 2018, the Company notified the NYSE that the Merger had been completed and requested that trading of the Company s Class A common stock on the NYSE be suspended and an application on Form 25 be filed with the Commission by the NYSE to remove the Company's Class A common stock from listing on the NYSE and deregister the Company's Class A common stock under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.

1168696_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of March 1, 2018, the Company had only one class of common stock and there was one stockholder of record.
1168696_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	Dividend Policy During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the "Fiscal 2016 Period"), Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate.

1168696_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	(3) During the quarter ended September 26, 2013, we redeemed 2.3 million of our National CineMedia common units for a like number of shares of NCM, Inc. common stock, which the Company sold in an underwritten public offering (including underwriter over-allotments) for $17.79 per share, reducing our investment in National CineMedia by approximately $10.0 million, the average carrying amount of the shares sold.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	The Company received approximately $40.9 million in proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $30.9 million.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P0_S3	We accounted for these transactions as a proportionate decrease in the Company's Initial Investment Tranche and Additional Investments Tranche and decreased our ownership share in National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P0_S4	See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	(4) During the years ended December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015, and December 26, 2013, we recorded long-lived asset and favorable lease impairment charges of $15.0 million, $7.9 million, $15.6 million, $5.6 million, and $9.5 million, respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $7.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively, as the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P1_S2	See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to our impairment policies.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest , which intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	ASU 2015-03 requires that they be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P3_S2	The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P3_S3	ASU 2015-03 is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P3_S4	The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	Debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt, net of accumulated amortization, were $23.1 million, $25.8 million, $30.7 million, $28.0 million, and $26.1 million as of December 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, January 1, 2015, and December 26, 2013, respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P4_S1	(6) On August 4, 2017, the Company sold all of its 50% equity interest in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC, to a third party for total proceeds of approximately $14.0 million.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P4_S2	In accordance with the purchase agreement, approximately $3.7 million of the net proceeds received were in satisfaction of various receivables and other amounts due to the Company related to film marketing services provided to Open Road Films prior to the closing date.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P4_S3	As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $17.8 million, representing the difference between the net proceeds received of $10.3 million (after satisfaction of the above amounts due the Company) and the carrying amount of the Company's investment in Open Road Films (approximately $(7.5) million) as of the closing date.
1168696_18_ITEM6_P4_S4	(7) As discussed in Part I of this Form 10-K, on December 5, 2017, Regal entered into the Merger Agreement and as a result, incurred merger related expenses of approximately $12.5 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview and Basis of Presentation We conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	We operate one of the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the United States, consisting of 7,322 screens in 560 theatres in 43 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	We believe the size, reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company manages its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	We generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs, our gift card and bulk ticket programs, various other activities in our theatres and through our relationship with National CineMedia, which focuses on in-theatre advertising.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film, and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Because we purchase certain concession items, such as fountain drinks and popcorn, in bulk and not pre-packaged for individual servings, we are able to maximize our margins by negotiating volume discounts.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	On December 5, 2017, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Cineworld, US Holdco and the Merger Sub, pursuant to which the Company became a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Cineworld upon the consummation of the Merger on February 28, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of the Company s Class A and Class B common stock were converted into the right to receive $23.00 in cash, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	respects by the fact that the Company became a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Cineworld upon consummation of the Merger on February 28, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	We evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions, which include those related to property and equipment, goodwill, deferred revenue pertaining to gift card and bulk ticket sales, income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	The results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	Actual results, under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, may differ materially from estimates.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	The impact and any associated risks related to estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, if applicable, where such estimates, assumptions, and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P7_S7	We believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	We have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Under current purchase accounting principles, we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities, including: (i) the acquired tangible and intangible assets, including property and equipment, (ii) the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (including contingencies), and (iii) the related deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations, for significant acquisitions, we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	The Company provides assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date, including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	The Company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	The Company then uses the information to determine fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S6	The third party valuation firms are supervised by Company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P8_S7	The Company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firms.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	The estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Historically, the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and, as a result, we have not disclosed such changes.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	In assessing the recoverability of the goodwill, we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	Our goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal 2017 indicated that the carrying value of one of our reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $7.3 million.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	Our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal 2016 indicated that the carrying value of one of our reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	Based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal 2015, we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	We depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Each owned theatre consists of a building structure, structural improvements, seating and concession and film display equipment.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	While we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than 30 years to certain acquired facilities, we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an estimated useful life of 30 years.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than 40 years.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	of-sale equipment, etc.), a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less, which has been our historical replacement period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Seats and digital projection equipment generally have longer useful economic lives, and their depreciable lives (10-17.5 years) are based on our experience and replacement practices.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	The estimates of the assets' useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Further, we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	To the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolete, we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S5	Actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S6	Historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S7	Furthermore, our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S8	Finally, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P13_S9	Such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	When the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets, such assets are written down to fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical (wear and tear) or functional (inadequacy or obsolescence) factors.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	In this regard, we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $13.5 million , $7.9 million and $15.6 million , respectively, specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres we deemed other than temporary.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization, or the methodology applied.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 , consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was $249.7 million , representing 7.9% of consolidated total revenues.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately $16.6 million, or 6.7%.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	If the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year, the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately $19.2 million, or 7.7%.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	We record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S5	We reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S6	An increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S7	A decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P18_S8	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	As described further in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Among other items deemed relevant by us, the evaluations are based on new legislation, other new technical guidance, judicial proceedings, and our specific circumstances, including the progress of tax audits.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	For fiscal 2017 , our provision for income taxes was $101.6 million .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	A one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from 47.5% to 48.5% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $2.1 million.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	As noted in our significant accounting policies for "Revenue Recognition" under Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to cash received from the sale of bulk tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Company recognizes revenue associated with bulk tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	We recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale-type certificates as revenue (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience, when the likelihood of redemption is remote, and when there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card and bulk ticket items to the relevant jurisdiction.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of historical redemption trends and considers various factors including the period outstanding, the level and frequency of activity, and the period of inactivity.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Results of Operations Based on our review of industry sources, North American box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to the Fiscal 2017 Period were estimated to have decreased by approximately two to three percent per screen in comparison to the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	The industry's box office results for fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by weaker than expected attendance generated by the overall film slate during the year.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items included in our consolidated statements of income for the Fiscal 2017 Period, the Fiscal 2016 Period and the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "Fiscal 2015 Period") (dollars and attendance in millions, except average ticket prices and average concessions per patron):
1168696_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ * Not meaningful (1) Percentage of revenues calculated as a percentage of admissions revenues.

1168696_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Fiscal 2017 Period Compared to Fiscal 2016 Period Admissions During the Fiscal 2017 Period, total admissions revenues decreased $53.6 million , or 2.6% , to $2,008.1 million , from $2,061.7 million in the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	revenues) led to the overall decrease in the Fiscal 2017 Period admissions revenues.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Attendance during the Fiscal 2017 Period in comparison to that of the Fiscal 2016 Period was negatively impacted by the weaker overall film slate during the Fiscal 2017 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	For the Fiscal 2017 Period, the 4.3% average ticket price increase was due to selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews (particularly at locations featuring luxury reclining seats), partially offset by a decrease in the percentage of our admissions revenues generated by premium format films exhibited during the Fiscal 2017 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Based on our review of certain industry sources, the decrease in our admissions revenues on a per screen basis was slightly greater than the industry s per screen results for the Fiscal 2017 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Concessions Total concessions revenues decreased $2.4 million , or 0.3% , to $930.2 million during the Fiscal 2017 Period, from $932.6 million for the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	A 6.6% decrease in attendance (approximately $61.6 million of total concessions revenues), partially offset by a 6.8% increase in average concessions revenues per patron (approximately $59.2 million of total concessions revenues) led to the overall decrease in the Fiscal 2017 Period concessions revenues.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	The 6.8% increase in average concessions revenues per patron for the Fiscal 2017 Period was primarily attributable to an increase in beverage and popcorn sales, selective price increases and the continued rollout of our expanded food and alcohol menu.

1168696_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The $40.3 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the Fiscal 2016 Period, as compared to the Fiscal 2015 Period, was primarily attributable to a $39.8 million increase in capital expenditures (net of proceeds from disposals) and higher capital investments in certain non-consolidated entities, partially offset by the impact of $9.2 million of cash used for a fiscal 2015 acquisition and $3.6 million in proceeds received related to the sale of RealD, Inc. common stock during the Fiscal 2016 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	Financing Activities As described further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, on June 1, 2016 Regal Cinemas entered into a permitted secured refinancing agreement with REH, the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG and the lenders party thereto (the "June 2016 Refinancing Agreement").

1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $953.7 million with a final maturity date in April 2022 (the "Refinanced Term Loans").
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Together with other amounts provided by Regal Cinemas, proceeds of the Refinanced Term Loans were applied to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the existing term facility under the Amended Senior Credit Facility in effect immediately prior to the making of the Refinanced Term Loans.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Pursuant to the June 2017 Refinancing Agreement, Regal Cinemas also exercised the "accordion" feature under the Amended Senior Credit Facility to increase the aggregate amount of term loans thereunder by $150.0 million (the "2017 Accordion").
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	The "accordion" feature provided Regal Cinemas with the option to borrow additional term loans under the Amended Senior Credit Facility in an amount of up to $200.0 million, plus additional amounts as would not cause the consolidated total leverage ratio to exceed 3.00:1.00, in each case, subject to lenders providing additional commitments for such amounts and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	The entire $150.0 million under the 2017 Accordion was fully drawn on June 6, 2017 on the same terms as the Refinanced Term Loans (such amounts drawn, the "Incremental Term Loans", and together with the Refinanced Term Loans, the "New Term Loans").
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S5	A portion of the proceeds of the Incremental Term Loans were used by Regal Cinemas to pay fees and expenses related to the June 2017 Refinancing Agreement, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes of Regal Cinemas and its subsidiaries.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S6	The New Term Loans amortized in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.0% of the original principal amount of the New Term Loans, with the balance payable on the maturity date of the New Term Loans.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S7	In connection with the execution of the June 2017 Refinancing Agreement, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.3 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S8	As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $1,097.2 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (net of debt discount) under the New Term Loans, $775.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S9	As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $2.7 million outstanding in letters of credit, leaving approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the Revolving Facility.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S10	As of December 31, 2017 , we are in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt obligations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S11	In connection with the consummation of the Merger, on February 28, 2018, all amounts outstanding under the Amended Senior Credit Facility were repaid in full, and the Amended Senior Credit Facility was terminated.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S12	Additionally, on February 28, 2018: (i) we notified Wilmington Trust National Association, in its capacity as trustee (the Trustee ), under the indentures governing our 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025 (collectively, the Notes ) of our intention to redeem all of the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the Notes, (ii) at our request, the Trustee distributed an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of the Notes, and (iii) we deposited with the Trustee funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders of the Notes sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes and thereby satisfied and discharged the indentures pursuant to the terms therein.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S13	The Notes will be redeemed in full on March 30, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S14	For more information regarding financing activities occurring after December 31, 2017, in connection with the Merger, refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During the Fiscal 2017 Period, Regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share on each outstanding share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock, or approximately $138.9 million in the aggregate.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S15	On February 7, 2018, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share on each share of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock (including outstanding restricted stock), which was paid on February 26, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 17, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S16	Declared dividends have been funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S17	Net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $17.0 million , $160.0 million and $178.6 million for the Fiscal 2017 Period, the Fiscal 2016 Period and the Fiscal 2015 Period, respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S18	The net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2017 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2016 Period of $143.0 million was primarily attributable to incremental borrowings under the Amended Senior Credit Facility in connection with the June 2017 Refinancing Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P49_S19	The net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the Fiscal 2016 Period as compared to the Fiscal 2015 Period of $18.6 million was primarily attributable to the net impact of the Amended Senior Credit Facility refinancing effected during the Fiscal 2015 Period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Sale-Leaseback Transactions For information regarding our various sale and leaseback transactions, refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments The Company has assumed long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Other than the operating leases that are detailed below, the Company does not utilize variable interest entities or any other form of off-balance sheet financing.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company's estimated contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next several periods are as follows (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) These amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our Amended Senior Credit Facility provided for mandatory prepayments under certain scenarios.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our long-term debt obligations and related matters.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	(2) Future interest payments on the Company's unhedged debt obligations as of December 31, 2017 (consisting of approximately $898.2 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Loans, $775.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2022, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2025, $250.0 million outstanding under the 5 3 / 4 % Senior Notes Due 2023 and approximately $2.8 million of other debt obligations) are based on the stated fixed rate or in the case of the $898.2 million of variable interest rate borrowings under the New Term Loans, the current interest rate specified in our Amended Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 (3.57%).
1168696_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Future interest payments are calculated based on interest rates implicit in the underlying leases, which have a weighted average interest rate of 11.22%, maturing in various installments through 2028.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our capital lease obligations and lease financing arrangements.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	(4) Includes estimated capital expenditures and investments to which we were contractually obligated as of December 31, 2017 , including improvements associated with existing theatres (including luxury reclining seating), the construction of new theatres and investments in non-consolidated entities.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	Does not include non-committed capital expenditures.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	(5) We enter into operating leases in the ordinary course of business.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	Such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	Our operating lease obligations are further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) The table does not include approximately $6.3 million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized state tax benefits because the timing of the related payments was not reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	In addition, as of December 31, 2017 , Regal Cinemas had approximately $82.3 million available for drawing under the $85.0 million Revolving Facility.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Regal Cinemas also maintained a sublimit within the Revolving Facility of $10.0 million for short-term loans and $30.0 million for letters of credit.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the operating leases detailed above in this Form 10-K, under the heading "Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments," the Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-07 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P60_S3	The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-09 had the impact of reducing income tax expense by approximately $1.3 million pertaining to excess tax benefits related to vesting of 493,516 restricted stock awards and to a lesser extent, dividends paid on restricted stock during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P60_S4	Historically, such excess tax benefits would have been recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control , which requires when assessing which party is the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the decision maker considers interests held by entities under common control on a proportionate basis instead of treating those interests as if they were that of the decision maker itself, as current U.S. GAAP requires.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	ASU 2016-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-17 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04 in connection with its interim goodwill impairment test performed during the year ended December 31, 2017 as further described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	In addition, amendments in subsequent Accounting Standards Updates have either clarified or revised guidance as set forth in ASU 2014-09, including ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net) , ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company has selected the modified retrospective method for adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its related ASU amendments.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Under this method, we will recognize the cumulative effect of the changes in retained earnings at the date of adoption (January 1, 2018) as described below, but will not restate prior periods.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	The adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its related ASU amendments primarily impacts the Company's accounting for its (i) loyalty program, (ii) gift cards and bulk tickets, including commissions paid to third parties, (iii) the classification of internet ticketing surcharges and (iv) amounts recorded as deferred revenue and the method of amortization for the advanced payment received in connection with the 2007 National CineMedia ESA modification and subsequent receipts of common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	While we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations, we do expect the standard to materially impact the timing and classification of revenues and related expenses in the following key areas:
1168696_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	First, we believe the advanced payment received in connection with the 2007 National CineMedia ESA modification and subsequent receipts of common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, each as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, include a significant financing component under ASU 2014-09.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Accordingly, we expect advertising revenues will increase materially with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense beginning January 1, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	Through December 31, 2017, the Company utilized the units of revenue method to amortize such amounts, but will change its amortization to a straight-line method under ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	We do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P69_S4	As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company expects to reduce its opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding credit to deferred revenue) by approximately $15 million to $20 million, before related tax effects, to give effect to the change in amortization method with respect to these advanced payments.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Second, under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will record internet ticketing surcharge fees based on the gross transaction price.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Previously, the Company recorded such fees net of third-party commission or service fees.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	This change will have the effect of materially increasing other operating revenues and other operating expenses, but will have no impact on net income or cash flows from operations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Third, with respect to our gift card and bulk ticket programs, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the annual revenue we currently recognize from these programs, but it will change the method in which we recognize revenue from gift cards and bulk tickets.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Through December 31, 2017, the Company recognized revenue associated with gift cards and bulk tickets when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption became remote (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	Under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will recognize revenue from unredeemed gift cards and bulk tickets as redeemed and will recognize breakage following the proportional method where revenue is recognized in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer when the Company expects that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur for any estimated breakage amounts.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company expects to reduce its opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding credit to deferred revenue) by approximately $25 million to $30 million, before related tax effects, to give effect to this change in accounting for our gift card and bulk ticket programs.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	With respect to gift card commissions paid to third parties, under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will begin to amortize the commission fees over the expected redemption period.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	Previously, such gift card commissions were expensed as incurred.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	We do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations, however we do expect to increase our opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding debit to a gift card commission contract asset) by approximately $18 million to $20 million, before related tax effects, to give effect to this change in accounting for our gift card commissions.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Finally, with respect to other areas impacted by ASU 2014-09 such as our loyalty program, we do not expect those accounting changes to have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Through December 31, 2017, the Company recorded the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will estimate the fair value of providing such loyalty program awards at the time the related awards are earned.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company expects to reduce its opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding credit to deferred revenue) by approximately $40 million to $50 million, before related tax effects, to give effect to this change in accounting for our loyalty program.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	The Company is currently finalizing its review of ASU 2014-09 and its related ASU amendments with respect to required disclosures and financial statement presentation for fiscal 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and believes that the significance of its future minimum rental payments will result in a material increase in ROU assets and lease liabilities.
1168696_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments .
1168696_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.

1168696_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of such controls as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1168696_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, our management believes that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholder and Board of Directors Regal Entertainment Group:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regal Entertainment Group and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S4	Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Mangement s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S5	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S6	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S7	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S8	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S9	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S10	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S11	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S12	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S13	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P4_S14	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2001.

1168696_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	In 2015, as a result of an internal restructuring, Anschutz Company changed its name to The Anschutz Corporation.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	On December 5, 2017, Regal entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Cineworld Group plc, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales ("Cineworld"), Crown Intermediate Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cineworld ("US Holdco"), and Crown Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Holdco (the "Merger Sub").

1168696_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Regal s Board of Directors unanimously approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement and recommended that stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P18_S3	See Note 16 "Subsequent Events," for further developments occurring after December 31, 2017 with respect to the Merger.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Regal and its subsidiaries.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company controls are consolidated while those affiliates of which the Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P19_S3	The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the consolidated financial statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P19_S4	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit card at the point of sale.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Other operating revenues consist primarily of product advertising (including vendor marketing programs) and other ancillary revenues that are recognized as income in the period earned.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Company generally recognizes payments received attributable to the marketing and advertising services provided by the Company under certain vendor programs as revenue in the periods in which the advertising is displayed or when the related impressions are delivered.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P20_S3	Such impressions are measured by the concession product sales volume, which is a mutually agreed upon proxy of attendance and reflects the Company's marketing and advertising services delivered to its vendors.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P20_S4	In instances where the consideration received is in excess of fair value of the advertising services provided, the excess is recorded as a reduction of concession costs.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company maintains a deferred revenue balance pertaining to amounts received for agreeing to the 2007 National CineMedia exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") modification, amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement described in Note 4 "Investments," and amounts received from the sale of bulk tickets and gift cards that have not been redeemed.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company recognizes revenue associated with bulk tickets and gift cards when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The determination of the likelihood of redemption is based on an analysis of actual historical redemption trends.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company considers all unrestricted highly liquid debt instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of 3 months or less to be cash equivalents.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	At December 31, 2017 , the Company held substantially all of its cash in temporary cash investments in the form of certificates of deposit and variable rate investment accounts with major financial institutions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Inventories consist of concession products and theatre supplies.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company states inventories on the basis of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost, which is not in excess of net realizable value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company states property and equipment at cost.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed currently.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P25_S2	Gains and losses from disposition of property and equipment are included in income and expense when realized.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company capitalizes the cost of computer equipment, system hardware and purchased software ready for service.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the Company capitalized approximately $14.3 million and $8.0 million , respectively, of such costs, which were associated primarily with (i) new point-of-sale devices at the Company's box offices and concession stands, (ii) new ticketing kiosks, and (iii) computer hardware and software purchased for the Company's theatre locations and corporate office.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	The Company also capitalizes certain direct external costs associated with software developed for internal use after the preliminary software project stage is completed and Company management has authorized further funding for a software project and it is deemed probable of completion.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company capitalizes these external software development costs only until the point at which the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company records depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , included in property and equipment is $189.3 million and $190.6 million of assets accounted for under capital leases and lease financing arrangements, before accumulated depreciation of $128.6 million and $118.0 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Company records amortization using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives noted above.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company reviews long-lived assets (including intangible assets, marketable equity securities and investments in non-consolidated entities as described further below) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	If the sum of the expected future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company considers historical theatre level cash flows, estimated future theatre level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, intangible asset carrying values, the age of the theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent pricing changes, strategic initiatives, available lease renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of whether or not a triggering event has occurred that indicates impairment of individual theatre assets may be necessary.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	For theatres where a triggering event is identified, impairment is measured based on the estimated cash flows from continuing use until the expected disposal date or the fair value of furniture, fixtures and equipment.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	The expected disposal date does not exceed the remaining lease period unless it is probable the lease period will be extended and may be less than the remaining lease period when the Company does not expect to operate the theatre to the end of its lease term.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	The fair value of assets is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows or the expected selling price less selling costs for assets of which the Company expects to dispose.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	Significant judgment is involved in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, estimating future cash flows and determining fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Management's estimates (Level 3 inputs as described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ) are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions, and current industry trading multiples.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company's analysis relative to long-lived assets resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $13.5 million , $7.9 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres we deemed other than temporary.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The majority of the Company's operations are conducted in premises occupied under non-cancelable lease agreements with initial base terms generally ranging from 15 to 20 years .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company, at its option, can renew a substantial portion of the leases at defined or then fair rental rates for various periods.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	Certain leases for our theatres provide for contingent rentals based on the revenue results of the underlying theatre and require the payment of taxes, insurance, and other costs applicable to the property.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	Also, certain leases contain escalating minimum rental provisions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	There are no conditions imposed upon us by our lease agreements or by parties other than the lessor that legally obligate the Company to incur costs to retire assets as a result of a decision to vacate our leased properties.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	None of our lease agreements require us to return the leased property to the lessor in its original condition (allowing for normal wear and tear) or to remove leasehold improvements at our cost.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company accounts for leased properties under the provisions of ASC Topic 840, Leases and other authoritative accounting literature.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	ASC Subtopic 840-10, Leases Overview requires that the Company evaluate each lease for classification as either a capital lease or an operating lease.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of the lease and when a modification is made to a lease.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	As to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases, the Company records property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term, or the fair value of the leased property.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The property under capital lease is amortized on a straight-line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term, as defined, or the economic life of the leased property, whichever is less.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P37_S2	During the lease term, as defined, each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P37_S3	The Company does not believe that exercise of the renewal options in its leases are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements because such leases: (i) provide for either (a) renewal rents based on market rates or (b) renewal rents that equal or exceed the initial rents, and (ii) do not impose economic penalties upon the determination whether or not to exercise the renewal option.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P37_S4	As a result, there are not sufficient economic incentives at the inception of the leases to consider the lease renewal options to be reasonably assured of being exercised and therefore, the initial base term is generally considered as the lease term under ASC Subtopic 840-10.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company records rent expense for its operating leases with contractual rent increases in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Operating Leases, on a straight-line basis from the "lease commencement date" as specified in the lease agreement until the end of the base lease term.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company accounts for lease incentive payments received from a landlord in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, Leases Lease Incentives , and records the proceeds as a deferred lease incentive liability and amortizes the liability as a reduction in rent expense over the base term of the lease.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	For leases in which the Company is involved with construction of the theatre, the Company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of ASC Subtopic 840-40, Leases Sale-Leaseback Transactions .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The landlord is typically responsible for constructing a theatre using guidelines and specifications agreed to by the Company and assumes substantially all of the risk of construction.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40, if the Company concludes that it has substantially all of the construction period risks, it records a construction asset and related liability for the amount of total project costs incurred during the construction period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	Once construction is completed, the Company considers the requirements under ASC Subtopic 840-40, for sale-leaseback treatment, and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements, it records the project's construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	The obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-20, we expense rental costs incurred during construction periods for operating leases as such costs are incurred.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	For rental costs incurred during construction periods for both operating and capital leases, the "lease commencement date" is the date at which we gain access to the leased asset.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , these rental costs have not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company accounts for the sale and leaseback of real estate assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 840-40.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Losses on sale leaseback transactions are recognized at the time of sale if the fair value of the property sold is less than the undepreciated cost of the property.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Gains on sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the remaining lease term.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was approximately $345.8 million and $327.0 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The $18.8 million net increase in goodwill during year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to $26.2 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the Company's acquisitions of nine theatres with 134 screens, which are more fully described in Note 3 "Acquisitions," partially offset by a $7.3 million impairment charge to one of the Company s reporting units as described below.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 350-20 , Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Goodwill , the Company has identified its reporting units to be the designated market areas in which the Company conducts its theatre operations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Goodwill impairment is evaluated using an approach requiring the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	The purpose of ASU 2017-04 was to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04 in connection with its interim goodwill impairment test performed during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 as further described below.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company determines fair value by using an enterprise valuation methodology determined by applying multiples to cash flow estimates less net indebtedness, which the Company believes is an appropriate method to determine fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	There is considerable management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate multiples and discount rates to be used in determining fair value and such management estimates fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	As part of the Company s ongoing operations, we may close certain theatres within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the theatre or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	Additionally, we generally abandon certain assets associated with a closed theatre, primarily leasehold improvements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	business shall be included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on disposal.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	We evaluate whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business on the date of closure.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Generally, on the date of closure, the closed theatre does not constitute a business because the Company retains assets and processes on that date essential to the operation of the theatre.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	These assets and processes are significant missing elements impeding the operation of a business.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	Accordingly, when closing individual theatres, we generally do not include goodwill in the calculation of any gain or loss on disposal of the related assets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	After considering various industry specific factors, the Company conducted an interim goodwill impairment assessment during the quarter ended September 30, 2017, which indicated that the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $7.3 million .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P52_S3	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2016 indicated that the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P52_S4	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2015 indicated that the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their carrying value and therefore, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , intangible assets totaled $69.6 million and $66.8 million , respectively, before accumulated amortization of $26.0 million and $20.8 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	Such intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company's identifiable intangible assets substantially consist of favorable leases acquired in connection with various acquisitions since fiscal 2008.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the Company recognized $3.8 million , $3.8 million and $3.7 million of amortization, respectively, related to these intangible assets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years for such intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 is projected below (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , the Company recorded a favorable lease impairment charge of approximately $1.4 million related to a theatre scheduled to be closed.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a favorable lease impairment charge of approximately $0.3 million related to a theatre closure.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company did not record an impairment of any intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Debt acquisition costs are deferred and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related agreements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest , which intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	Prior to the issuance of ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs were reported on the balance sheet as assets and amortized as interest expense.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	ASU 2015-03 requires that they be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S4	The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S5	The Company adopted this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P56_S6	Debt issuance costs associated with long-term debt, net of accumulated amortization, were $23.1 million and $25.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company primarily accounts for its investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting and has recorded the investments within "Other Non-Current Assets" and "Other Non-Current Liabilities" as applicable in its consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Company records equity in earnings and losses of these entities in its consolidated statements of income.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company holds a 17.9% interest in National CineMedia, LLC ("National CineMedia" or "NCM") and a 46.7% interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P57_S3	The carrying value of the Company's investment in these and other entities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was approximately $407.1 million and $367.7 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Company reviews investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	The Company reviews unaudited financial statements on a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis for indicators of triggering events or circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of these investments as well as current equity prices for its investment in National CineMedia and discounted projections of cash flows for certain of its other investees.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	Additionally, the Company has periodic discussions with the management of significant investees to assist in the identification of any factors that might indicate the potential for impairment.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	In order to determine whether the carrying value of investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value necessitating the write-down of the recorded investment, the Company considers various factors, including the period of time during which the fair value of the investment remains substantially below the recorded amounts, the investees' financial condition and quality of assets, the length of time the investee has been operating, the severity and nature of losses sustained in current and prior years, a reduction or cessation in the investees dividend payments, suspension of trading in the security, qualifications in accountant's reports due to liquidity or going concern issues, investee announcement of adverse changes, downgrading of investee debt, regulatory actions, changes in reserves for product liability, loss of a principal customer, negative operating cash flows or working capital deficiencies and the recording of an impairment charge by the investee for goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P58_S4	Once a determination is made that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company writes down its investment to fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	There was no impairment of the Company's investments during the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	The Company records a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that its deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S5	The Company expects that certain deferred income tax assets are not more likely than not to be recovered and therefore has established a valuation allowance.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P60_S6	The Company reassesses its need for the valuation allowance for its deferred income taxes on an ongoing basis.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Additionally, income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation, require judgment by the Company and may be challenged by the taxation authorities.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	As described further in Note 7 "Income Taxes," the Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, Income Taxes Overview .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	In accordance with ASC Subtopic 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit only for tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustainable based on the technical merits of the tax position.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	With respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate, the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of the Company's process for determining the provision for income taxes.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Regal Cinemas has entered into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations under Regal Cinemas' Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated or de-designated prior to maturity, gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income or loss remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S3	See Note 14 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company s interest rate swaps fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S4	The fair value of the Company's interest rate swaps is based on Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S5	The counterparties to the Company s interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P65_S6	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Deferred revenue relates primarily to the amount we received for agreeing to the 2007 ESA modification, amounts recorded in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia, cash received from the sale of bulk tickets and gift cards, and amounts received in connection with vendor marketing programs.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification is being amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the agreement following the units of revenue method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P66_S2	In addition, as described in Note 4 "Investments," amounts recorded as deferred revenue in connection with the receipt of newly issued common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement are being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P66_S3	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , approximately $418.5 million and $425.0 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the ESA was recorded as components of current and non-current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P66_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , approximately $168.6 million and $175.6 million of deferred revenue, respectively, related to the gift cards and bulk tickets was recorded as a component of current deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company recognizes rent on a straight-line basis after considering the effect of rent escalation provisions resulting in a level monthly rent expense for each lease over its term.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	The deferred rent liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company estimates its film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management's best estimate of the ultimate settlement of the film costs with the distributors.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Generally, less than one - third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period-end.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	The length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film's theatrical run, but is typically "settled" within 2 to 3 months of a particular film's opening release.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P68_S3	Upon settlement with our film distributors, film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Members of the Regal Crown Club earn credits for each dollar spent at the Company's theatres and can redeem such credits for movie tickets, concession items and movie memorabilia at the theatre or in an online reward center.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	Because the Company believes that the value of the awards granted to Regal Crown Club members is insignificant in relation to the value of the transactions necessary to earn the award, the Company records the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	Historically, and for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the costs of these awards have not been significant to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	Start-up costs associated with a new theatre are also expensed as incurred.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	As described in Note 9 "Capital Stock and Share-Based Compensation," we apply the provisions of ASC Subtopic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation Overall .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Under ASC Subtopic 718-10, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, deferred revenue, property and equipment, goodwill, income taxes and purchase accounting.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the Company managed its business under one reportable segment: theatre exhibition operations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company accounts for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in income.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	For significant acquisitions, the Company obtains independent third party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist the Company in determining fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	The estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the actual amounts recorded.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's results from operations beginning from the day of acquisition.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Total comprehensive income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $116.1 million , $171.3 million and $152.6 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	Total comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income, net of tax, related to the change in the aggregate unrealized gain/loss on the Company's interest rate swap arrangement, the change in fair value of available for sale equity securities (including other-than-temporary impairments), the reclassification adjustment for gain on sale of available for sale securities recognized in net income and the change in fair value of equity method investee interest rate swap transactions during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-07 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-09 had the impact of reducing income tax expense by approximately $1.3 million pertaining to excess tax benefits related to vesting of 493,516 restricted stock awards and to a lesser extent, dividends paid on restricted stock during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P80_S4	Historically, such excess tax benefits would have been recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control , which requires when assessing which party is the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the decision maker considers interests held by entities under common control on a proportionate basis instead of treating those interests as if they were that of the decision maker itself, as current U.S. GAAP requires.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	ASU 2016-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company's adoption of ASU 2016-17 during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04 in connection with its interim goodwill impairment test performed during the year ended December 31, 2017 as further described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P84_S2	The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	However, the standard was deferred by ASU 2015-14, issued by the FASB in August 2015, and is now effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	In addition, amendments in subsequent Accounting Standards Updates have either clarified or revised guidance as set forth in ASU 2014-09, including ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net) , ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company has selected the modified retrospective method for adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its related ASU amendments.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	Under this method, we will recognize the cumulative effect of the changes in retained earnings at the date of adoption (January 1, 2018) as described below, but will not restate prior periods.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	The adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its related ASU amendments primarily impacts the Company's accounting for its (i) loyalty program, (ii) gift cards and bulk tickets, including commissions paid to third parties, (iii) the classification of internet ticketing surcharges and (iv) amounts recorded as deferred revenue and the method of amortization for the advanced payment received in connection with the 2007 National CineMedia ESA modification and subsequent receipts of common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	While we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations, we do expect the standard to materially impact the timing and classification of revenues and related expenses in the following key areas:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	First, we believe the advanced payment received in connection with the 2007 National CineMedia ESA modification and subsequent receipts of common units of National CineMedia pursuant to the provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, each as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, include a significant financing component under ASU 2014-09.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	Accordingly, we expect advertising revenues will increase materially with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense beginning January 1, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	Through December 31, 2017, the Company utilized the units of revenue method to amortize such amounts, but will change its amortization to a straight-line method under ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P88_S3	We do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P88_S4	As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company expects to reduce its opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding credit to deferred revenue) by approximately $15 million to $20 million , before related tax effects, to give effect to the change in amortization method with respect to these advanced payments.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	Second, under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will record internet ticketing surcharge fees based on the gross transaction price.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	Previously, the Company recorded such fees net of third-party commission or service fees.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	This change will have the effect of materially increasing other operating revenues and other operating expenses, but will have no impact on net income or cash flows from operations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Third, with respect to our gift card and bulk ticket programs, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the annual revenue we currently recognize from these programs, but it will change the method in which we recognize revenue from gift cards and bulk tickets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	Through December 31, 2017, the Company recognized revenue associated with gift cards and bulk tickets when redeemed, or when the likelihood of redemption became remote (known as "breakage" in our industry) based on historical experience.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P90_S2	Under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will recognize revenue from unredeemed gift cards and bulk tickets as redeemed and will recognize breakage following the proportional method where revenue is recognized in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer when the Company expects that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur for any estimated breakage amounts.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P90_S3	As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company expects to reduce its opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding credit to deferred revenue) by approximately $25 million to $30 million , before related tax effects, to give effect to this change in accounting for our gift card and bulk ticket programs.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	With respect to gift card commissions paid to third parties, under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will begin to amortize the commission fees over the expected redemption period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Previously, such gift card commissions were expensed as incurred.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	We do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations, however we do expect to increase our opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding debit to a gift card commission contract asset) by approximately $18 million to $20 million , before related tax effects, to give effect to this change in accounting for our gift card commissions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Finally, with respect to other areas impacted by ASU 2014-09 such as our loyalty program, we do not expect those accounting changes to have a material impact on our net income or cash flows from operations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Through December 31, 2017, the Company recorded the estimated incremental cost of providing awards under the Regal Crown Club loyalty program at the time the awards are earned.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	Under ASU 2014-09 and effective January 1, 2018, the Company will estimate the fair value of providing such loyalty program awards at the time the related awards are earned.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company expects to reduce its opening January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance (along with a corresponding credit to deferred revenue) by approximately $40 million to $50 million , before related tax effects, to give effect to this change in accounting for our loyalty program.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company is currently finalizing its review of ASU 2014-09 and its related ASU amendments with respect to required disclosures and financial statement presentation for fiscal 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	ASU 2016-02 establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and believes that the significance of its future minimum rental payments will result in a material increase in ROU assets and lease liabilities.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P98_S3	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory at the time of the transfer instead of deferring the tax consequences until the asset has been sold to an outside party, as current U.S. GAAP requires.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	Early application is permitted in any interim or annual period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-16 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The purpose of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P101_S2	ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	The amendments in ASU 2017-01 should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2017-01 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which is intended to simplify and amend the application of hedge accounting to more clearly portray the economics of an entity s risk management strategies in its financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	ASU 2017-12 also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P102_S3	The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the initial adoption date.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company is evaluating the impact that ASU 2017-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	On April 13, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of two theatres with 41 screens located in Houston, Texas from Santikos Theaters, Inc. for an aggregate net cash purchase price of $29.8 million .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	In addition, on April 18, 2017, the Company purchased a parcel of land located in Montgomery County, Texas from an entity affiliated with Santikos Theaters, Inc. for a net cash purchase price of approximately $7.3 million .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	On May 18, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of seven theatres with 93 screens located in Kansas and Oklahoma from Warren Theatres for an aggregate net cash purchase price, before post-closing adjustments, of $134.5 million .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P104_S3	The Company incurred approximately $1.7 million in transaction costs associated with these acquisitions, which are reflected in "general and administrative expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for year ended December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	The transactions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , which requires allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in each transaction.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	The allocation of purchase price is based on management s judgment after evaluating several factors, including preliminary valuation assessments.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	Any changes in the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	The allocation of purchase price is preliminary and subject to changes as appraisals of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities including working capital are finalized, purchase price adjustments are completed and additional information regarding the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the acquisition date becomes available.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	The following is a summary of the final allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the respective dates of acquisition (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	________________________________ (1) Goodwill represents the excess aggregate purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed and is fully deductible for tax purposes.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	The results of operations of the acquired theatre operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	The acquisitions contributed approximately $57.9 million of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	Net income was an immaterial amount for the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following unaudited pro forma results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 assume the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 2016.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to indicate the results of operations which would actually have occurred had the combination been in effect on the dates indicated, or which may occur in the future.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	We maintain an investment in National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	National CineMedia provides in-theatre advertising for its theatrical exhibition partners, which include us, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ("AMC") and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. ("Cinemark").
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ("NCM, Inc."), the sole manager of National CineMedia, completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	NCM, Inc. sold 38.0 million shares of its common stock for $21 per share in the IPO, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	NCM, Inc. used a portion of the net cash proceeds from the IPO to acquire newly issued common units from National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	At the closing of the IPO, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 4.0 million shares of common stock of NCM, Inc. at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S4	In connection with this over-allotment option exercise, Regal, AMC and Cinemark each sold to NCM, Inc. common units of National CineMedia on a pro rata basis at the initial offering price of $21 per share, less underwriting discounts and expenses.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S5	Upon completion of this sale of common units, Regal held approximately 21.2 million common units of National CineMedia ("Initial Investment Tranche").
1168696_18_ITEM8_P112_S6	Such common units are immediately redeemable on a one -to-one basis for shares of NCM, Inc. common stock.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	As a result of the transactions associated with the IPO and receipt of proceeds in excess of our investment balance, the Company reduced its investment in National CineMedia to zero .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	In addition, subsequent to the IPO, the Company determined it would not recognize its share of any undistributed equity in the earnings of National CineMedia pertaining to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia until National CineMedia's future net earnings, net of distributions received, equal or exceed the amount of the above described excess distribution.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	Until such time, equity in earnings related to the Company's Initial Investment Tranche in National CineMedia will be recognized only to the extent that the Company receives cash distributions from National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P114_S2	The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor's basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Company's Initial Investment Tranche is recorded at $0 cost.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	In connection with the completion of the IPO, the joint venture partners, including RCI, amended and restated their exhibitor services agreements with National CineMedia in exchange for a significant portion of its pro rata share of the IPO proceeds.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	The modification extended the term of the exhibitor services agreement ("ESA") to 30 years , provided National CineMedia with a 5 -year right of first refusal beginning one year prior to the end of the term and changed the basis upon which RCI is paid by National CineMedia from a percentage of revenues associated with advertising contracts entered into by National CineMedia to a monthly theatre access fee.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	The theatre access fee is composed of a fixed $0.0816 payment per patron for fiscal 2017 and increases by 8% every 5 years starting at the end of fiscal 2011, a fixed $800 payment per digital screen each year, which increases by 5% annually starting at the end of fiscal 2007 (or $1,304 for fiscal 2017) and an additional payment per digital screen of $670 for fiscal 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	The access fee revenues received by the Company under its contract are determined annually based on a combination of both fixed and variable factors which include the total number of theatre screens, attendance and actual revenues (as defined in the ESA) generated by National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S2	The ESA does not require us to maintain a minimum number of screens and does not provide a fixed amount of access fee revenue to be earned by the Company in any period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S3	The theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to us, AMC and Cinemark will not be less than 12% of NCM's aggregate advertising revenue, or it will be adjusted upward to meet this minimum payment.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S4	On-screen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire is provided by National CineMedia under the terms of the ESA.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S5	In addition, we receive mandatory quarterly distributions of any excess cash from National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P117_S6	The modified ESA has, except with respect to certain limited services, a remaining term of approximately 20 years .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	The amount we received for agreeing to the ESA modification was approximately $281.0 million , which represents the estimated fair value of the ESA modification payment.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	We estimated the fair value of the ESA payment based upon a valuation performed by the Company with the assistance of third party specialists.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to advertising revenue over the 30 year term of the ESA following the units of revenue method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Under the units of revenue method, amortization for a period is calculated by computing a ratio of the proceeds received from the ESA modification payment to the total expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA over the 30 year term of the agreement and then applying that ratio to the current period's expected decrease in revenues due to entry into the new ESA.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	Also in connection with the IPO, the joint venture partners entered into a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	Pursuant to our Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time, common units of National CineMedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted up or down through a formula primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P120_S2	The common unit adjustment is computed annually, except that an earlier common unit adjustment will occur for a joint venture partner if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent common unit adjustment, will cause a change of two percent or more in the total annual attendance of all of the joint venture partners.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P120_S3	In the event that a common unit adjustment is determined to be a negative number, the joint venture partner shall cause, at its election, either (a) the transfer and surrender to National CineMedia a number of common units equal to all or part of such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment or (b) pay to National CineMedia, an amount equal to such joint venture partner's common unit adjustment calculated in accordance with the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P120_S4	If the Company elects to surrender common units as part of a negative common unit adjustment, the Company would record a reduction to deferred revenue at the then fair value of the common units surrendered and a reduction of the Company s Additional Investments Tranche at an amount equal to the weighted average cost for the Additional Investments Tranche common units, with the difference between the two values recorded as a non-operating gain or loss.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	As described further below, subsequent to the IPO and through December 31, 2017 , the Company received from National CineMedia approximately 12.9 million newly issued common units of National CineMedia ("Additional Investments Tranche") as a result of the adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments included in its Additional Investments Tranche equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P122_S3	As such, the Additional Investments Tranche is accounted for separately from the Company's Initial Investment Tranche following the equity method with undistributed equity earnings included as a component of "Earnings recognized from NCM" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions have the effect of reducing the amounts NCM, Inc. would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities as a result of an increase in Regal's proportionate share of tax basis in NCM Inc.'s tangible and intangible assets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	On the IPO date, NCM, Inc., the Company, AMC and Cinemark entered into a tax receivable agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, NCM, Inc. will make cash payments to us, AMC and Cinemark in amounts equal to 90% of NCM, Inc.'s actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the intangible assets described above.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P123_S3	For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income and franchise tax will be computed by comparing NCM, Inc.'s actual income and franchise tax liability to the amount of such taxes that NCM, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase in NCM Inc.'s proportionate share of tax basis in NCM's tangible and intangible assets and had the tax receivable agreement not been entered into.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P123_S4	The tax receivable agreement shall generally apply to NCM, Inc.'s taxable years up to and including the 30 t h anniversary date of the NCM, Inc. IPO and related transactions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Company accounts for its investment in National CineMedia following the equity method of accounting and such investment is included as a component of "Other Non-Current Assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	Below is a summary of activity with National CineMedia included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) On March 16, 2017, March 17, 2016, and March 17, 2015, we received from National CineMedia approximately 0.5 million , 0.7 million and 0.6 million , respectively, newly issued common units of National CineMedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	The Company recorded the additional common units (Additional Investments Tranche) at fair value using the available closing stock prices of NCM, Inc. as of the dates on which the units were issued.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	As a result of these adjustments, the Company recorded increases to its investment in National CineMedia (along with corresponding increases to deferred revenue) of $6.3 million , $9.9 million and $9.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P125_S3	Such deferred revenue amounts are being amortized to advertising revenue over the remaining term of the ESA between RCI and National CineMedia following the units of revenue method as described in (4) below.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , we held approximately 27.6 million common units of National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	On a fully diluted basis, we own a 17.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	(2) During the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the Company received $37.7 million , $34.7 million , $40.0 million , respectively, in cash distributions from National CineMedia, exclusive of receipts for services performed under the ESA (including payments of $8.3 million , $11.4 million , and $9.5 million received under the tax receivable agreement).

1168696_18_ITEM8_P190_S0	A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes as reported and the amount computed by multiplying the income before taxes and extraordinary item by the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% was as follows (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act ) was signed into law by President Trump.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P191_S1	The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	U.S. GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	As a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company recorded federal and state tax expense of $10.5 million due to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional amounts when a company does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Tax Reform Act.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	With respect to our accounting for the effect of the changes in the Tax Reform Act, we are still in the process of evaluating the transition rule applicable to the executive compensation limitations that will be effective January 1, 2018 and the impact of the full-expensing provisions on property and equipment placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P195_S1	Furthermore, the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the Company s investments in National CineMedia and DCIP are based on estimates of the tax basis of these investments at December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P195_S2	Therefore, the federal and state tax expenses represent provisional amounts and the Company s current best estimate.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company s current interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P197_S0	Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax asset consisted of the following at (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	At December 31, 2017 , the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $69.4 million with expiration commencing in 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P198_S1	The Company's net operating loss carryforwards were generated by the entities of Edwards and Hollywood Theaters.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an "ownership change" of a corporation.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P199_S1	Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize the net operating losses acquired from Edwards and Hollywood Theaters may be impaired as a result of the "ownership change" limitations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P199_S2	The Company s state net operating losses may be carried forward for various periods, between seven and 20 years , with expiration commencing in 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P199_S3	The Company also has net operating losses in U.S. territorial jurisdictions with expirations commencing in 2019.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	In assessing the realizable value of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P200_S1	The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P200_S2	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $16.7 million and $34.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively, as management believes it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized in future tax periods.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P200_S3	Future reductions in the valuation allowance associated with a change in management's determination of the Company's ability to realize these deferred tax assets will result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P200_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , the valuation allowance decreased by $11.0 million related to a reduction in certain state net operating losses in connection with the settlement of state tax positions and decreased by $6.8 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	In accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 740-10, a reconciliation of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was as follows (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	Exclusive of interest and penalties, it is reasonably possible that gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with state tax positions will decrease between $0.6 million and $3.5 million within the next 12 months primarily due to the settlement of tax disputes with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	The total net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $4.6 million and $5.4 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P203_S1	Additionally, the total net unrecognized tax benefits that would result in an increase to the valuation allowance if recognized at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was approximately $0.0 million and $1.7 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P204_S1	As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the Company has accrued gross interest and penalties of approximately $2.0 million and $1.8 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P204_S2	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0.2 million , $(0.2) million and $0.3 million , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries collectively file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and U.S. territory jurisdictions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P205_S1	The Company is not subject to U.S. federal or U.S. Territory examinations before 2014, and with limited exceptions, state examinations before 2013.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P205_S2	However, the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of tax attributes created in closed tax years if such tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company settled an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examination of its 2014 federal income tax return.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P206_S1	The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	In September 2017, the Company was notified that the IRS would examine its 2015 federal tax return.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P207_S1	The Company is in the process of providing information requested by the IRS with respect to such tax year.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P207_S2	Management believes that it has provided adequate provision for income taxes relative to the tax year under examination.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company is presently involved in various judicial, administrative, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in the ordinary course of business operations, including but not limited to, personal injury claims, landlord-tenant, antitrust, vendor and other third party disputes, tax disputes, employment and other contractual matters, some of which are described below.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	Many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P208_S2	The Company's theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	On October 9, 2012, staff at the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Board (the "Regional Board") notified United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. ( UATC ), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, that the Regional Board was contemplating issuing a cleanup and abatement order to UATC with respect to a property in Santa Clara, California that UATC owned and then leased during the 1960s and 1970s.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P209_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Regional Board issued a tentative order to UATC setting out proposed site clean-up requirements for UATC with respect to the property.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P209_S2	According to the Regional Board, the property in question has been contaminated by dry-cleaning facilities that operated at the property in question from approximately 1961 until 1996.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P209_S3	The Regional Board also issued a tentative order to the current property owner, who has been conducting site investigation and remediation activities at the site for several years.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P209_S4	UATC submitted comments to the Regional Board on July 28, 2013, objecting to the tentative order.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P209_S5	The Regional Board considered the matter at its regular meeting on September 11, 2013 and adopted the tentative order with only minor changes.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	On October 11, 2013, UATC filed a petition with the State Water Resources Control Board ( the State Board ) for review of the Regional Board s order.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	The State Board failed to act on the petition and hence by operation of law it was deemed denied, and UATC filed a petition for writ of mandamus with the California Superior Court seeking review and modification of the order.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	On September 29, 2017, the Superior Court ruled in UATC s favor and granted its Petition for a Writ of Mandamus challenging the cleanup and abatement order, and remanded the matter to the Regional Board for further proceedings in light of the Superior Court s opinion.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S3	On November 3, 2017, the court amended its order to allow the Regional Board to remove UATC as a named discharger under the order while leaving the rest of the order intact against the current property owner.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S4	On November 30, 2017, the Regional Board filed a notice of appeal with the California Court of Appeal.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S5	UATC subsequently filed a notice of cross appeal to preserve its bankruptcy defense.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S6	UATC intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P210_S7	UATC has been cooperating with the Regional Board while it appeals the Regional Board's cleanup and abatement order.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	October 27, 2015, the Regional Board approved, a Remedial Action Plan ( RAP ) to remediate the dry-cleaner contamination.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	We believe that we are, and were during the period in question described in this paragraph, in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	On January 28, 2016, Regional Board staff contacted UATC s counsel in the Santa Clara matter to ascertain whether he would be representing UATC in connection with the cleanup of a drycleaner-impacted property located in Millbrae, California that the Regional Board believes UATC or related entities formerly owned during the dry-cleaning operations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	Counsel subsequently responded in the affirmative.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P212_S2	The Company has received no further communications from the Regional Board on this matter.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	On May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. announced that it had entered into a merger agreement to acquire Screenvision, LLC ("Screenvision").
1168696_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	On November 3, 2014, the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed an antitrust lawsuit seeking to enjoin the proposed merger between NCM, Inc. and Screenvision.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P213_S2	On March 16, 2015, NCM, Inc. announced that it had agreed with Screenvision to terminate the merger agreement.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	On March 17, 2015, the Company was notified by the DOJ that it had opened an investigation into potential anticompetitive conduct by and coordination among NCM, Inc., National CineMedia, Regal, AMC and Cinemark (the DOJ Notice ).
1168696_18_ITEM8_P214_S1	In addition, the DOJ Notice requested that the Company preserve all documents and information since January 1, 2011 relating to movie clearances or communications or cooperation between and among AMC, Regal and Cinemark or their participation in NCM.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	On May 28, 2015, the Company received a civil investigative demand (the CID ) from the DOJ as part of an investigation into potentially anticompetitive conduct under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	The Company has also received investigative demands from the antitrust sections of various state attorneys general regarding movie clearances and Regal's various joint venture investments, including National CineMedia.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	The CID and various state investigative demands require the Company to produce documents and answer interrogatories.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P216_S1	The Company may receive additional investigative demands from the DOJ and state attorneys general regarding these or related matters.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P216_S2	The Company has cooperated with these investigations and other related Federal or state investigations.

1168696_18_ITEM8_P271_S0	We compute earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P272_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P272_S1	Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P273_S0	Potential common stock equivalents consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock and performance share units.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P273_S1	The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock and performance share units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury-stock method.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P273_S2	In addition, the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P274_S0	The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P274_S1	The earnings for the periods presented are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P274_S2	As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P274_S3	Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock, the earnings are equal to net income attributable to controlling interest for that computation.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P275_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share and per share data):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P276_S0	From time to time, Regal Cinemas enters into hedging relationships via interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate exposure of its variable rate debt obligations under the Amended Senior Credit Facility.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P276_S1	Certain of these interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, and as such, the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps' gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion reported in earnings.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P276_S2	As interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to the interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P277_S0	earnings in the periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P277_S1	See Note 14 "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" for discussion of the Company s interest rate swaps fair value estimation methods and assumptions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P278_S0	Below is a summary of Regal Cinemas' current interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2017 :
1168696_18_ITEM8_P279_S0	On April 2, 2015, Regal Cinemas amended two of its existing interest rate swap agreements originally designated as cash flow hedges on $350.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P279_S1	Since the terms of the interest rate swaps designated in the original cash flow hedge relationships changed with these amendments, we de-designated the original hedge relationships and re-designated the amended interest rate swaps in new cash flow hedge relationships as of the amendment date of April 2, 2015.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P280_S0	On December 31, 2016, one of these interest rate swap agreements designated to hedge $150.0 million of variable rate debt obligations expired.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P281_S0	In connection with the June 2017 Refinancing Agreement described further in Note 5 "Debt Obligations, no amendment or modification was made to the Company's interest swap agreement expiring on June 30, 2018 (originally designated to hedge $200.0 million of variable rate debt obligations).
1168696_18_ITEM8_P281_S1	As a result, the interest rate swap no longer met the highly effective qualification for cash flow hedge accounting and accordingly, the remaining hedge relationship was de-designated effective June 6, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P281_S2	Since the interest rate swap no longer qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the change in its fair value since de-designation is recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the interest rate swap's gain or loss reported as a component of interest expense during the period of change.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P281_S3	We estimate that $0.5 million of deferred pre-tax losses attributable to this interest rate swap will be reclassified into earnings as interest expense through June 30, 2018 as the underlying hedged transaction occurs.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P282_S0	As detailed in the table above, on August 9, 2017, Regal Cinemas entered into two additional hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements with effective dates beginning on June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018 and maturity terms ending on June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P282_S1	These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and will require Regal Cinemas to pay interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.90% to 1.908% and receive interest at a variable rate.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P282_S2	The interest rate swaps are designated to hedge $450.0 million of variable rate debt obligations.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P283_S0	The following tables show the effective portion of gains and losses on derivative instruments designated and qualifying in cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), and amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/loss to interest expense for the periods indicated (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P284_S0	The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net associated with the Company s interest rate swap arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 were as follows (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P285_S0	The following table sets forth the effect of our interest rate swap arrangements on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 (in millions):
1168696_18_ITEM8_P286_S0	________________________________ (1) Amounts represent the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives and are recorded as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P287_S0	(2) Amounts represent the change in fair value of the former hedging derivatives and are recorded as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements from the de-designation dates of April 2, 2015 and June 6, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P288_S0	Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P288_S1	The inputs used to develop these fair value measurements are established in a hierarchy, which ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P289_S0	The fair value classification is based on levels of inputs.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P289_S1	Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories described in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P290_S0	Level 1 Inputs: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P291_S0	Level 2 Inputs: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P292_S0	Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P293_S0	The following tables summarize the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 :
1168696_18_ITEM8_P294_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps described in Note 13 "Derivative Instruments" is based on Level 2 inputs, which include observable inputs such as dealer quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, and represents the estimated amount Regal Cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors, including current interest rates, credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P295_S0	The counterparties to the Company s interest rate swaps are major financial institutions.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P295_S1	The Company evaluates the bond ratings of the financial institutions and believes that credit risk is at an acceptably low level.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P296_S0	There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P296_S1	There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P297_S0	In addition, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P297_S1	The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument are as follows:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P298_S0	Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities:
1168696_18_ITEM8_P299_S0	The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P300_S0	As further described in Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the Company regularly reviews long-lived assets (primarily property and equipment), intangible assets and investments in non-consolidated entities, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P300_S1	When the estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is recorded to write the asset down to its estimated fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P301_S0	The Company s analysis relative to long-lived assets resulted in the recording of impairment charges of $13.5 million , $7.9 million and $15.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P301_S1	The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatres we deemed other than temporary.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P302_S0	The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P302_S1	After considering various industry specific factors, the Company conducted an interim goodwill impairment assessment during the quarter ended September 30, 2017, which indicated that the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value.
1168696_18_ITEM8_P302_S2	As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $7.3 million .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P302_S3	The Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2016 indicated that the carrying value of one of its reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value and as a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1.7 million .

1168696_18_ITEM8_P305_S0	The fair value of the Amended Senior Credit Facility described in Note 5 "Debt Obligations," which consists of the New Term Loans and the Revolving Facility, is estimated based on quoted prices (Level 2 inputs as described in ASC Topic 820) as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
1168696_18_ITEM8_P305_S1	The associated interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and are assumed to approximate fair value.

1168696_18_ITEM11_P0_S1	The discussion provided below highlights our compensation programs and practices for fiscal 2017 through the Merger.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P1_S0	The Merger Agreement includes provisions for the treatment of outstanding equity awards under our 2002 Stock Incentive Plan.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P1_S1	For more information regarding the treatment of such outstanding equity awards, please refer to "Executive Compensation-Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P2_S0	Goals and Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program The primary goals of our Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation were to create value for our stockholders in both the short and long term through growth in our earnings and profits and to motivate and reward our executive officers, including our named executive officers as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Ms. Miles and Messrs. Ownby, Dunn and Brandow.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P3_S0	fiscal 2017, were the achievement of budgeted levels of revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent ("EBITDAR") margin and other non financial goals that the Compensation Committee and board of directors deem important.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P3_S1	We implemented this philosophy by focusing on the following three key objectives: to attract, retain and motivate talented executives; to tie annual and long term compensation incentives to achievement of specified performance objectives; and to create long term value by aligning the interests of our executives with our stockholders.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P4_S0	To achieve these objectives, management and the members of the Compensation Committee analyzed market data and evaluated individual executive performance with a goal of setting compensation at levels they believed, based on their general business and industry knowledge and experience, were comparable with executives in companies of similar size operating in the domestic motion picture exhibition industry and other comparable companies.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P4_S1	For fiscal 2017, these companies were AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. and Cinemark Holdings, Inc., based on such companies industry, size and scope of operations.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P4_S2	The members of the Compensation Committee also took into account retention needs, internal pay equity, our relative performance and our own strategic goals in determining executive compensation.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P4_S3	We generally relied on SEC filings made by each of the comparable companies or other publicly available data to collect this information.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P5_S0	Our executive compensation program consisted of the following elements:
1168696_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	Base salaries for our executives was established based on the scope of their responsibilities, taking into account competitive market compensation for similar positions at comparable companies, as well as seniority of the individual, and our ability to replace the individual.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P6_S1	For fiscal 2017, the base salaries for our named executive officers were increased based on the Compensation Committee s performance assessment and in keeping with the Company s compensation philosophy.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	Pursuant to the employment agreements with Ms. Miles and Messrs. Ownby, Dunn and Brandow, each such executive was eligible for annual cash incentive compensation under our Annual Executive Incentive Program, based on the Company s financial performance in relation to predetermined performance goals for the prior fiscal year.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P7_S1	Under the material terms for our payment of executive incentive compensation, which was approved by our board of directors and our stockholders, the Compensation Committee had negative discretion, which prohibited the Compensation Committee from increasing the amount of compensation payable if a performance goal were met, but allowed the Compensation Committee to reduce or eliminate compensation even if such performance goal were attained.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	Our Compensation Committee targeted annual cash incentive amounts for performance during fiscal 2017 at 100% of base salary for Ms. Miles and Mr. Dunn and 85% of base salary for Messrs. Ownby and Brandow, with an additional stretch incentive amount of up to 50% of base salary for Ms. Miles and Mr. Dunn and up to 42.5% of base salary for Messrs. Ownby and Brandow.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P8_S1	The actual amount of annual cash incentive, which varies by individual, was determined following a review of each named executive officer s individual performance and contribution to our strategic and financial goals.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P8_S2	Each annual cash incentive is paid in cash in an amount reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter following the completion of a given fiscal year.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P8_S3	The Compensation Committee determined the cash incentives for fiscal 2017 for the named executive officers on January 10, 2018.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P8_S4	The Company exceeded its adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR margin targets in fiscal 2017 and the Compensation Committee evaluated performance and approved the payment of annual cash incentives at 100% of base salary for each of Ms. Miles and Mr. Dunn and at 85% of base salary for each of Messrs. Ownby and Brandow.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P8_S5	See the discussion under the heading Summary Compensation Table for those amounts.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	We utilized a combination of awards of shares of restricted stock and performance shares under our 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, which has been approved by our board of directors and our stockholders, with the goal of retaining our executive officers in a challenging business environment and aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P9_S1	Our restricted stock awards applied time based vesting and our performance shares applied both performance and time based vesting.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P10_S0	As described above, awards of restricted stock served to retain our executive officers over the vesting period of the grant by conditioning delivery of the underlying shares on continued employment with our Company for the vesting period.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	Our performance shares provided our executive officers with equity incentives for attaining long term corporate goals and maximizing stockholder value over the course of three years.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	incentive program, the establishment of performance targets and the mix of performance and time based targets as a percentage of each executive officer s compensation were established by our Compensation Committee and approved by our board of directors after discussion with, and recommendations from, our Chief Executive Officer (with respect to executives other than herself) and independent compensation consultants retained by the Compensation Committee.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	We did not grant perquisites to our executive officers.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	We previously entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers that provide for severance payments if we terminate such executive officer's employment, or such executive officer resigns for good reason (as defined within each employment agreement), within three months prior to, or within one year after, a change in control (as defined within each employment agreement) of the Company.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	We entered into these change in control arrangements to encourage continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of the Company.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P15_S1	The three month and one year periods were designed to retain our named executive officers through the date of the change in control and for a one-year period thereafter in order to allow us to effectuate the change in control and transition to new ownership with the benefit of the institutional knowledge and industry experience of these executive officers.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P16_S0	We also provide for severance payments if we terminate the named executive officers' employment without cause (as defined within each employment agreement) or if the named executive officers terminate their employment for good reason.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P16_S1	We believe that these termination provisions reflect both market practices and competitive factors.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P16_S2	Our board of directors believed that these severance payments and benefit arrangements were necessary to attract and retain our named executive officers.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P17_S0	The board of directors and the Compensation Committee considered the results of our most recent advisory vote on executive compensation, which was submitted to our stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P17_S1	Approximately 99% of the total number of votes cast at the 2017 Annual Meeting approved our executive compensation program, indicating support for our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P17_S2	The Compensation Committee considered these results in determining to operate the fiscal 2017 executive compensation program similar to the fiscal 2016 executive compensation program.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P18_S0	Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform ) being signed into law on December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallowed tax deductions for publicly-held companies for compensation paid to certain of its executive officers who were covered employees under this rule in excess of $1.0 million per officer in any year.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P18_S1	Performance-based compensation was exempt from this deduction limitation if specific requirements set forth in the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations were met.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P19_S0	The Tax Reform repealed the exemption from Section 162(m) s deduction limit for performance-based compensation, effective for the taxable years after December 31, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P19_S1	Accordingly, compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1.0 million during such taxable years will not be deductible unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P20_S0	Messrs. Kaplan, Brymer and Keyte were members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P20_S1	None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has been an executive officer of Regal, nor did any of them have any relationships requiring disclosure by Regal under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. None of Regal s executive officers served as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, an executive officer of which served as a director of Regal or member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P21_S0	COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee met with management to review and discuss this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P21_S1	Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Form 10-K for fiscal 2017, and the board of directors has approved that recommendation.

1168696_18_ITEM11_P51_S1	Generally, we have experienced comparatively higher turnover rates with our seasonal, part time employees, as compared to our full-time employees.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P51_S2	Accordingly, the median total compensation we estimate below, as well as the resulting ratio of Ms. Miles compensation to such estimated median total compensation is reflective of both the seasonal, part-time nature of the majority of our employees, as well as the fact that we experience a high turnover rate with such employees each fiscal year.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P52_S0	Ms. Miles, our Principal Executive Officer, had fiscal 2017 total compensation of $4,990,172 , as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Form 10-K.

1168696_18_ITEM11_P52_S1	As a result, Ms. Miles fiscal 2017 total compensation was 895 times greater than that of the median total compensation for all of our employees.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P53_S0	We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total compensation for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis).
1168696_18_ITEM11_P53_S1	For such employees, we did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017.
1168696_18_ITEM11_P53_S2	After identifying the median employee, we calculated the above total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table referred to above.
