59527_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Any forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise speak only as of the date of the statement, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update those statements.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and assigning appropriate consideration for such risks.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The risk factors and uncertainties described below together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Company's operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, trade barriers in the world markets and changes in tax laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for the Company's products, thereby impacting our results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The availability and prices for raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	shortages due to global economic factors.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have also experienced substantial volatility in prices for other raw materials, including metals, chemicals and energy costs.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging manganese induced illness and litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	At December 31, 2010, we were a co-defendant in cases alleging manganese induced illness involving claims by approximately 1,975 plaintiffs and a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 16,865 plaintiffs.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In the manganese cases, the claimants allege that exposure to manganese contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse neurological conditions, including a condition known as manganism.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In the asbestos cases, the claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in manganese cases that have been resolved as follows: 14,859 of those claims were dismissed, 23 were tried to defense verdicts in favor of us and five were tried to plaintiff verdicts (three of which were reversed on appeal and one of which has post-trial motions pending).
59527_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, 13 claims were resolved by agreement for immaterial amounts and one claim was decided in favor of the Company following a summary judgment motion.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 38,968 of those claims were dismissed, 17 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts (two of which are being appealed), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 573 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The long-term impact of the manganese and asbestos loss contingencies, in each case in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal claims relating to exposure to manganese and asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Manganese is an essential element of steel and cannot be eliminated from welding consumables.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery, and various other construction projects.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The cyclicality and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is very cyclical in nature.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	For example, we have completed and continue to pursue acquisitions in emerging markets including, but not limited to Brazil, Russia, India and China in order to strategically position resources to increase our presence in growing markets.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, our revenues and gross margins may suffer.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We have recently initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to current market conditions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be harmed by this practice.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our long-term strategy is to continue to increase our market share in growing international markets, particularly Asia (with emphasis in China and India), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia and other developing markets.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant and growing.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Many developing countries have a significant degree of political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil that may impede our ability to implement and achieve our international growth objectives.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Conducting business internationally subjects us to corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention).
59527_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Failure by the Company or its sales representatives, agents or distributors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified managerial, technical (including research and development), sales and marketing, and customer service personnel.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our revenues and results of operations may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time-consuming and costly.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If these systems are damaged or cease to function properly and we suffer any interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There is a growing political and scientific belief that emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG") alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the global climate.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These concerns may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the near future.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Such regulation could result in new or additional regulatory or product standard requirements for the Company's global businesses.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P61_S4	We are unable, at this time, to predict the significance of these requirements as the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standards is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of theorized climate change on the Company's customers, and therefore on the Company's operations, are speculative and highly uncertain, and would be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of the Company's operations which we are unable, at this time, to predict.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated locations can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis.
59527_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company's corporate headquarters and principal United States manufacturing facilities are located in the Cleveland, Ohio area.
59527_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Total Cleveland area property consists of 233 acres, of which present manufacturing facilities comprise an area of approximately 2,940,000 square feet.
59527_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company has 40 manufacturing facilities, including operations and joint ventures in 19 countries, the locations (grouped by operating segment) of which are as follows:
59527_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	Cleveland, Ohio; San Diego Oceanside, California.
59527_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	Shanghai; Jinzhou; Nanjing; Zhengzhou; Luan County.
59527_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	Mason, Ohio; Gainesville, Georgia; Santa Fe Springs, California.
59527_11_ITEM2_P5_S0	All properties relating to the Company's Cleveland, Ohio headquarters and manufacturing facilities are owned by the Company.
59527_11_ITEM2_P6_S0	Most of the Company's foreign subsidiaries own manufacturing facilities in the country where they are located.
59527_11_ITEM2_P6_S1	The Company believes that its existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.
59527_11_ITEM2_P6_S2	At December 31, 2010, $1.4 million of indebtedness under capital leases was secured by property with a book value of $4.5 million.
59527_11_ITEM2_P7_S0	In addition, the Company maintains operating leases for many of its distribution centers and sales offices throughout the world.
59527_11_ITEM2_P7_S1	See Note 13 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company's lease commitments.
59527_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	The number of record holders of common shares at December 31, 2010 was 1,694.
59527_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The total amount of dividends paid in 2010 was $47.4 million.
59527_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	During 2010, dividends were paid quarterly on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15.
59527_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	Quarterly high and low stock prices and dividends declared for the last two years were:
59527_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	Issuer purchases of equity securities for the fourth quarter 2010 were:
59527_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	(1) The Company's Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs for up to 15 million shares of the Company's common stock.
59527_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	Total shares purchased through the share repurchase programs were 11,918,507 shares at a cost of $314.2 million for a weighted average cost of $26.36 per share through December 31, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following line graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total shareholder return on the Company's common stock against the cumulative total return of the S P Composite 500 Stock Index ("S P 500") and the S P 400 MidCap Index ("S P 400") for the five-year calendar period commencing January 1, 2006 and ending December 31, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	This graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2005 in each of the Conpany's common stock, the S P 500 and the S P 400.
59527_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	A peer-group index for the welding industry, in general, was not readily available because the industry is comprised of a large number of privately held competitors and competitors that are relatively small entities of large publicly traded companies.
59527_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read together with "Selected Financial Data," the Company's consolidated financial statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

59527_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	During July 2003 and April 2004, the Company entered into various floating rate interest rate swap agreements totaling $110,000 to convert a portion of the Notes outstanding from fixed to floating rates based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").

59527_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	The primary reason for the increase in the weighted average interest rate is the shift during 2010 in short-term borrowings from geographic areas with lower interest rates to areas with higher interest rates.

59527_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock awards exercised during 2010 and 2009 was $5,006 and $2,236, respectively.
59527_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Intrinsic value is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the awards.
59527_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Product liability costs have been significant particularly with respect to welding fume claims.
59527_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Costs incurred are volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	Product liability costs decreased $2,905 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to increased insurance reimbursement and reversal of reserves following successful appeals.
59527_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	The long-term impact of the welding fume loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims and indemnity payments have been immaterial.
59527_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	If cost sharing dissipates for some currently unforeseen reason, or the Company's trial experience changes overall, it is possible on a longer term basis that the cost of resolving this loss contingency could materially reduce the Company's operating results, cash flows and restrict capital market access.
59527_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	ASU 2010-06 amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820-10-50 to require additional information to be disclosed principally with respect to Level 3 fair value measurements and transfers to and from Level 1 and Level 2 measurements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	In addition, enhanced disclosure is required concerning inputs and valuation techniques used to determine Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures, as required by ASU 2010-06, are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
59527_11_ITEM7_P114_S4	ASU 2010-06 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2010 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 810 (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation 46(R)" ).
59527_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	The objective of ASC 810 is to amend certain requirements of FASB Interpretation 46(R) (revised December 2003), " Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	ASC 810 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2010 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued ASC 860, "Transfers and Servicing," (formerly SFAS 166, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement 140" ).
59527_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	The objective of ASC 860 is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows; and a transferor's continuing involvement in transferred financial assets.
59527_11_ITEM7_P116_S2	ASC 860 must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
59527_11_ITEM7_P116_S3	ASU 2009-16 must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date.
59527_11_ITEM7_P116_S4	ASU 2009-16 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2010 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC 810 (formerly SFAS 160, " Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ").
59527_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	ASC 810 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	ASC 810 changes the way the consolidated statement of income is presented thus requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both parent and the noncontrolling interest.
59527_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	This pronouncement was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
59527_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	New Accounting Standards to be Adopted:
59527_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	The objective of ASU No. 2010-29 is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
59527_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	This standard is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2010-29, but does not expect it will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	This update provides amendments to the criteria in Subtopic ASC 605-25.
59527_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	ASU No. 2009-13 provides principles for allocating consideration among multiple-elements and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement.
59527_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	ASC 605-25, as amended, introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price is not available and significantly expands related disclosure requirements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	This standard is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	Alternatively, adoption may be on a retrospective basis and early application is permitted.
59527_11_ITEM7_P121_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2009-13, but does not expect it will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_11_ITEM7_P122_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_11_ITEM7_P122_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	The Company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos and manganese-induced illnesses.
59527_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_11_ITEM7_P124_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_11_ITEM7_P126_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_11_ITEM7_P126_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_11_ITEM7_P126_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_11_ITEM7_P126_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_11_ITEM7_P126_S5	See Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and the "Legal Proceedings" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of legal contingencies.
59527_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions.
59527_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	Exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	Exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_11_ITEM7_P129_S3	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at monthly exchange rates.
59527_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts, and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in "Selling, general administrative expenses" and were $118, $226 and $10,409 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
59527_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency (U.S. dollar).
59527_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	A currency control board exists in Venezuela that is responsible for foreign exchange procedures, including approval of requests for exchanges of the Venezuelan currency (the "bolivar") for U.S. dollars at the official (government established) exchange rates.
59527_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	An unregulated parallel market that existed for exchanging bolivars for U.S. dollars through securities transactions was terminated by the Venezuelan government on May 17, 2010 and subsequently established as a regulated market on June 9, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	The official exchange rate in Venezuela had been fixed at 2.15 bolivars to 1 U.S. dollar for several years.
59527_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	The official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential changed from 2.15 to 2.60 (the "Essential Rate"), while the official exchange rate for other non-essential goods moved to an exchange rate of 4.30 (the "Non-Essential Rate").
59527_11_ITEM7_P135_S2	In remeasuring the financial statements the Non-Essential Rate is used as this is the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations.
59527_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the Essential Rate effective as of January 1, 2011.
59527_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The impact of the elimination of the Essential Rate on the Company's consolidated results of operations is not expected to be significant.
59527_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	An economy is considered highly inflationary under GAAP if the cumulative inflation rate for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100 percent.
59527_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The Venezuelan three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent during the fourth quarter of 2009.
59527_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
59527_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company's Venezuelan operation's balance sheet.
59527_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	At December 31, 2010, the net bolivar-denominated monetary liability position was $4,715.
59527_11_ITEM7_P139_S2	In addition, the Company participates in Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings from time to time as a means of converting bolivars to U.S. dollars.
59527_11_ITEM7_P139_S3	The conversion of bolivars to U.S. dollars through Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings generates foreign currency transaction losses as the debt is purchased at the Non-Essential Rate and subsequently sold at a discount.
59527_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	During the second half of 2010, the Company acquired $7,672 of Venezuelan sovereign debt at the Non-Essential Rate, which was immediately sold at a discount for $6,022.
59527_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	The devaluation of the bolivar and the change to the U.S. dollar as the functional currency resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain of $2,632 in "Selling, general administrative expenses" and higher "Cost of goods sold" of $5,755 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
59527_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_11_ITEM7_P142_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings of $4,690 that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_11_ITEM7_P142_S4	At December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $136,814 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_11_ITEM7_P143_S2	At December 31, 2010, a valuation allowance of $38,451 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_11_ITEM7_P143_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_11_ITEM7_P143_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_11_ITEM7_P144_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_11_ITEM7_P144_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relates to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_11_ITEM7_P147_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 7.9% and 8.2% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
59527_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_11_ITEM7_P148_S3	The amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense.
59527_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	During 2010, investment returns were 13.2% compared with a return of 16.3% in 2009.
59527_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,600.
59527_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption to be used, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA- or better.
59527_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 5.3% at December 31, 2010.
59527_11_ITEM7_P150_S3	A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $2,000.
59527_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	Pension expense relating to the Company's defined benefit plans was $29,123, $34,774 and $4,613 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
59527_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	The Company expects 2011 defined benefit pension expense to decrease by approximately $4,000 to $5,000.
59527_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $41,500, $45,000 and $20,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
59527_11_ITEM7_P152_S1	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $30,000 to its U.S. plans in 2011.
59527_11_ITEM7_P152_S2	Based on current pension funding rules, the Company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in 2011.
59527_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	An actual valuation of the inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	results as they are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
59527_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $70,906 at December 31, 2010 and $62,447 at December 31, 2009.
59527_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_11_ITEM7_P157_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to cost of sales may be required.
59527_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_11_ITEM7_P159_S1	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_11_ITEM7_P159_S2	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

59527_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Forward-looking statements, and our future performance, operating results, financial position and liquidity, are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect results, including those risks described below.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Any forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise speak only as of the date of the statement, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update those statements.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and assigning appropriate consideration for such risks.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our goal is to proactively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Company's operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for the Company's products, thereby impacting our results of operations, financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The availability and prices for raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The price of steel used to manufacture our products has experienced periods of significant price volatility and has been subject to periodic shortages due to global economic factors.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We have also experienced substantial volatility in prices for other raw materials, including nonferrous metals, chemicals and energy costs.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging manganese induced illness and litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	At December 31, 2011, we were a co-defendant in cases alleging manganese induced illness involving claims by approximately 806 plaintiffs and a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 16,781 plaintiffs.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In the manganese cases, the claimants allege that exposure to manganese contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse neurological conditions, including a condition known as manganism.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in manganese cases that have been resolved as follows: 16,031 of those claims were dismissed, 23 were tried to defense verdicts in favor of us and five were tried to plaintiff verdicts (three of which were reversed on appeal and one of which has post-trial motions pending).
59527_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, 13 claims were resolved by agreement for immaterial amounts and one claim was decided in favor of the Company following a summary judgment motion.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 39,199 of those claims were dismissed, 18 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts (two of which are being appealed), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 585 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The long-term impact of the manganese and asbestos loss contingencies, in each case in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal claims relating to exposure to manganese and asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, in January 2012, the Company and 18 co-defendants entered into an agreement that provides for the dismissal with prejudice of substantially all of the pending manganese claims if certain conditions precedent are satisfied.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Failure to satisfy those conditions could lead to the resumption of that litigation and increased defense costs.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Manganese is an essential element of steel and cannot be eliminated from welding consumables.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery, and various other construction projects.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The cyclicality and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For example, we have completed and continue to pursue acquisitions in emerging markets including, but not limited to, Brazil, Russia, India and China in order to strategically position resources to increase our presence in growing markets.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, our revenues and gross margins may suffer.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have a large and varied customer base due, in part, to our extensive distribution channels in the industries and regions that we serve.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Although no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total Net sales, there are customers to which we sell a large amount of product.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our long-term strategy is to continue to increase our market share in growing international markets, particularly Asia (with emphasis in China and India), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia and other developing markets.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant and growing.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Many developing countries have a significant degree of political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil that may impede our ability to implement and achieve our international growth objectives.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Conducting business internationally subjects us to corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention).
59527_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Failure by the Company or its sales representatives, agents or distributors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified managerial, technical (including research and development), sales and marketing, and customer service personnel.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P43_S4	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our revenues and results of operations may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time-consuming and costly.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	For a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected by significant changes in 2011, refer to the pension related disclosure under "Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Policies" and Note 10 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	There is a growing political and scientific belief that emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG") alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the global climate.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	These concerns may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Such regulation could result in new or additional regulatory or product standard requirements for the Company's global businesses.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S4	We are unable, at this time, to predict the significance of these requirements as the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standards is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of theorized climate change on the Company's customers, and therefore on the Company's operations, are speculative and highly uncertain, and would be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S6	These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P60_S7	These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of the Company's operations which we are unable, at this time, to predict.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated locations can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis.
59527_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company's corporate headquarters and principal United States manufacturing facilities are located in the Cleveland, Ohio area.
59527_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Total Cleveland area property consists of 233 acres, of which present manufacturing facilities comprise an area of approximately 2,940,000 square feet.
59527_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company has 42 manufacturing facilities, including operations and joint ventures in 19 countries, the locations (grouped by operating segment) of which are as follows:
59527_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	Cleveland, Ohio; San Diego and Oceanside, California; Reno, Nevada; Baltimore, Maryland.
59527_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	Shanghai; Jinzhou; Nanjing; Zhengzhou; Luan County.
59527_12_ITEM2_P4_S0	Mason, Ohio; Gainesville, Georgia; Santa Fe Springs, California.
59527_12_ITEM2_P5_S0	All properties relating to the Company's Cleveland, Ohio headquarters and manufacturing facilities are owned by the Company.
59527_12_ITEM2_P6_S0	Most of the Company's foreign subsidiaries own manufacturing facilities in the country where they are located.
59527_12_ITEM2_P6_S1	The Company believes that its existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.
59527_12_ITEM2_P6_S2	At December 31, 2011, $0.8 million of indebtedness under capital leases was secured by property with a book value of $3.8 million.

59527_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the Notes agreement.
59527_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	The Company repaid the $40,000 Series A Notes and the $30,000 Series B Notes in March 2007 and March 2009, respectively, reducing the balance outstanding of the Notes to $80,000, which is due in March 2012.
59527_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	During March 2002, the Company entered into floating rate interest rate swap agreements totaling $80,000 to convert a portion of the Notes outstanding from fixed to floating rates.
59527_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	These swaps were designated as fair value hedges and, as such, the gains or losses on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, were recognized in earnings.
59527_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	In May 2003, these swap agreements were terminated.
59527_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	The gain of $10,613 on the termination of these swaps was deferred and is being amortized as an offset to "Interest expense" over the remaining life of the Notes.
59527_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	The amortization of this gain reduced "Interest expense" by $206 in 2011, $206 in 2010 and $313 in 2009, and is expected to reduce annual "Interest expense" by $30 in 2012.
59527_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	During July 2003 and April 2004, the Company entered into various floating rate interest rate swap agreements totaling $110,000 to convert a portion of the Notes outstanding from fixed to floating rates based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").
59527_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	These swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges and, as such, the gains or losses on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item, were recognized in earnings.

59527_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	The amortization of this gain reduced "Interest expense" by $1,661 in 2011, $1,661 in 2010 and $1,429 in 2009, and is expected to reduce annual "Interest expense" by $328 in 2012.
59527_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	During March 2009, swaps designated as fair value hedges that converted the $30,000 Series B Notes from fixed to floating interest rates matured with the underlying Notes.
59527_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The Company has no interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2011.
59527_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	The weighted average effective rate on the Notes, net of the impact of swaps, was 4.0% for both 2011 and 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $84,110 and $88,120, respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment.
59527_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.
59527_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	On November 18, 2009, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") for a $150,000 revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes.
59527_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Credit Agreement has a three-year term that is set to expire in November 2012.
59527_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	later than 180 days prior to the last day of the term, the Credit Agreement may be increased, subject to certain conditions, by an additional amount up to $75,000.
59527_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	The interest rate on borrowings is based on either LIBOR or the prime rate, plus a spread based on the Company's leverage ratio, at the Company's election.
59527_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	A quarterly facility fee is payable based upon the daily aggregate amount of commitments and the Company's leverage ratio.
59527_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	The Company expects to replace the Credit Agreement prior to its expiration in November 2012, although there can be no assurances that the Company can replace the Credit Agreement or that satisfactory terms will be reached.
59527_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, transactions with affiliates and a fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio.
59527_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, but had letters of credit outstanding totaling $60, which reduced the availability under the Credit Agreement to $149,940.
59527_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	The Company's short-term borrowings included in "Amounts due banks" were $19,922 and $11,283 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and represent the borrowings of foreign subsidiaries at weighted average interest rates of 11.6% and 17.1%, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The primary reason for the decrease in the weighted average interest rate is the shift during 2011 in short-term borrowings from geographic areas with higher interest rates to areas with lower interest rates.
59527_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	The Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:

59527_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	As of December 31, 2011, there was $26,656 of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits.
59527_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.
59527_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	See Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
59527_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	The Company expects to contribute approximately $30,000 to the U.S. pension plans in 2012.

59527_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	The EPI Plan provides for the granting of options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance-based awards up to an additional 6,000,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	In addition, on April 28, 2006, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended ("Director Plan"), which replaced the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors adopted in 2000.
59527_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	The Director Plan provides for the granting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units up to an additional 600,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_12_ITEM7_P102_S4	At December 31, 2011, there were 3,061,346 common shares available for future grant under all plans.
59527_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 648,561 in 2011, 603,874 in 2010 and 772,610 in 2009.
59527_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Company issued shares of common stock from treasury upon all exercises of stock options and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
59527_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $6,610, $8,213 and $5,432, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	The related tax benefit for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $2,515, $3,112 and $2,058, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	As of December 31, 2011, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $18,898, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 37 months.
59527_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable that would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2011, was $47,467 and $41,192, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during 2011 and 2010 was $15,781 and $5,006, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Product liability costs have been significant particularly with respect to welding fume claims.
59527_12_ITEM7_P108_S1	Costs incurred are volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_12_ITEM7_P108_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	Product liability costs decreased $1,387 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to reduced trial activity.
59527_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	The long-term impact of the welding fume loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims and indemnity payments have been immaterial.
59527_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	In January 2012, the Company and 18 co-defendants entered into an agreement that provides for the dismissal with prejudice of substantially all of the pending manganese claims if certain conditions precedent are satisfied.
59527_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	Lastly, if cost sharing dissipates for some currently unforeseen reason, or the Company's trial experience changes overall, it is possible on a longer term basis that the cost of resolving this loss contingency could materially reduce the Company's operating results, cash flows and restrict capital market access.
59527_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	The objective of ASU 2011-09 is to address concerns regarding the lack of transparency with respect to an employer's participation in a multiemployer pension plan.
59527_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	For employers that participate in multiemployer pension plans, the update will require additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures including: the significant multiemployer plans in which the employer participates; the level of participations in those plans; the financial health of the plans, including funded status and; the nature of the employer commitments to the plan.
59527_12_ITEM7_P111_S2	This standard is effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011.
59527_12_ITEM7_P111_S3	The amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented.
59527_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	ASU 2011-09 was adopted by the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	The objective of ASU 2010-29 is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
59527_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	This standard is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P113_S2	ASU 2010-29 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2011 and did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	This update provides amendments to the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Subtopic 605-25.
59527_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	ASU 2009-13 provides principles for allocating consideration among multiple-elements and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement.
59527_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	ASC 605-25, as amended, introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price is not available and significantly expands related disclosure requirements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	This standard is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P115_S3	Alternatively, adoption may be on a retrospective basis.
59527_12_ITEM7_P115_S4	ASU 2009-13 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2011 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	New Accounting Standards to be Adopted:
59527_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	ASU 2011-11 requires an entity to disclose information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to offsetting, master netting or other similar arrangements, to illustrate the effect or potential effect of those arrangements on the Company's financial position.
59527_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.
59527_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	retrospectively for all prior periods presented.
59527_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2011-11 on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	ASU 2011-08 provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstance leads to the determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
59527_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	If the entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
59527_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	However, if the entity concludes otherwise, it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test.
59527_12_ITEM7_P119_S3	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
59527_12_ITEM7_P119_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	This update provides amendments to ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income.
59527_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	ASU 2011-05 provides an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	Under both options, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income.
59527_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	Further, ASC 2011-05 requires the presentation on the face of the financial statements items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented.
59527_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	All remaining amendments of ASU 2011-05 are unaffected by this update.
59527_12_ITEM7_P121_S4	ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
59527_12_ITEM7_P121_S5	The Company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	ASU 2011-04 amends ASC Topic 820, resulting in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").
59527_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	Consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P122_S2	These amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
59527_12_ITEM7_P122_S3	The Company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_12_ITEM7_P123_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2011.
59527_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos and manganese-induced illnesses.
59527_12_ITEM7_P126_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_12_ITEM7_P126_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S5	See Note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and "Item 3.
59527_12_ITEM7_P128_S6	Legal Proceedings" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of legal contingencies.
59527_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	The Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions.
59527_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	Exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_12_ITEM7_P131_S2	Exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_12_ITEM7_P131_S3	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at monthly exchange rates.
59527_12_ITEM7_P132_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_12_ITEM7_P132_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts, and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in "Selling, general administrative expenses" and were $4,904, $118 and $226 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency (U.S. dollar).
59527_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	A currency control board exists in Venezuela that is responsible for foreign exchange procedures, including approval of requests for exchanges of the Venezuelan currency (the "bolivar") for U.S. dollars at the official (government established) exchange rates.
59527_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	An unregulated parallel market that existed for exchanging bolivars for U.S. dollars through securities transactions was terminated by the Venezuelan government on May 17, 2010 and subsequently established as a regulated market on June 9, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	The official exchange rate in Venezuela had been fixed at 2.15 bolivars to 1 U.S. dollar for several years.
59527_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	On January 8, 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential changed from 2.15 to 2.60 (the "Essential Rate"), while the official exchange rate for other non-essential goods moved to an exchange rate of 4.30 (the "Non-Essential Rate").
59527_12_ITEM7_P137_S2	In remeasuring the financial statements the Non-Essential Rate is used as this is the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations.
59527_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	In December 2010, the Venezuelan government announced the elimination of the Essential Rate effective as of January 1, 2011.
59527_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	The impact of the elimination of the Essential Rate did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
59527_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company's Venezuelan operation's balance sheet.
59527_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $6,826 at December 31, 2011, compared to a net liability position of $4,715 at December 31, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P143_S1	The increased exposure was due to the limited opportunities to convert bolivars into U.S. dollars.
59527_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	If in the future the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, the Company may realize a loss to earnings.
59527_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	In 2010, the Company participated in Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings as a means of converting bolivars to U.S. dollars.
59527_12_ITEM7_P145_S1	The conversion of bolivars to U.S. dollars through Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings generated foreign currency transaction losses as the debt was purchased at the Non-Essential Rate and subsequently sold at a discount.
59527_12_ITEM7_P145_S2	During 2010, the Company acquired $7,672 of Venezuelan sovereign debt at the Non-Essential Rate, which was immediately sold at a discount for $6,022.
59527_12_ITEM7_P145_S3	In 2011, the Company was not successful in utilizing this vehicle as a means of converting bolivars to U.S. dollars.
59527_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	The devaluation of the bolivar and the change to the U.S. dollar as the functional currency resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain of $2,632 in "Selling, general administrative expenses" and higher "Cost of goods sold" of $5,755 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
59527_12_ITEM7_P147_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_12_ITEM7_P147_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_12_ITEM7_P147_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings of $3,776 that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_12_ITEM7_P147_S4	At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately $160,271 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_12_ITEM7_P148_S2	At December 31, 2011, a valuation allowance of $31,713 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_12_ITEM7_P148_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_12_ITEM7_P148_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_12_ITEM7_P149_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_12_ITEM7_P149_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_12_ITEM7_P149_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relates to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_12_ITEM7_P152_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_12_ITEM7_P152_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_12_ITEM7_P152_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 7.9% at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_12_ITEM7_P153_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_12_ITEM7_P153_S3	The amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense.
59527_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	During 2011, investment returns were 4.1% compared with a return of 13.2% in 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,600.
59527_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption to be used, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA- or better.
59527_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	December 31, 2011 and 5.3% at December 31, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,000.
59527_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	Pension expense relating to the Company's defined benefit plans was $26,370, $29,123 and $34,774 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	The Company expects 2012 defined benefit pension expense to increase by approximately $7,000 to $9,000 as a result of actuarial losses.
59527_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $408,000 as of December 31, 2011 and $280,652 as of December 31, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	The increase is primarily the result of an increase in actuarial losses.
59527_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	Actuarial losses arising during 2011 are primarily attributable to a lower discount rate and lower actual return on plan assets compared with the expected return on plan assets.
59527_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $30,000, $41,500 and $45,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
59527_12_ITEM7_P159_S1	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $30,000 to its U.S. plans in 2012.
59527_12_ITEM7_P159_S2	Based on current pension funding rules, the Company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in 2012.
59527_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	An actual valuation of the inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_12_ITEM7_P162_S2	Because these estimates are subject to many factors beyond management's control, annual results may differ from interim results as they are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
59527_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $78,292 at December 31, 2011 and $70,906 at December 31, 2010.
59527_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_12_ITEM7_P164_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_12_ITEM7_P166_S1	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_12_ITEM7_P166_S2	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_12_ITEM7_P169_S1	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_12_ITEM7_P170_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_12_ITEM7_P171_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_12_ITEM7_P172_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_12_ITEM7_P173_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	The fair value of goodwill for all of the Company's operating business units exceeded its carrying value by at least 10% as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of 2011.
59527_12_ITEM7_P174_S1	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_12_ITEM7_P174_S2	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_12_ITEM7_P175_S1	The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company's stock, the expected life of the stock award and the Company's dividend yield.
59527_12_ITEM7_P175_S2	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_12_ITEM7_P175_S3	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management's control could have a direct impact on the Black-Scholes model.

59527_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer's knowledge: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the Report.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and assigning appropriate consideration for such risks.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S10	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S11	The Company's operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Further recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for the Company's products, thereby impacting our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S13	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S14	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S15	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P1_S16	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The availability and prices for raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	The price of steel used to manufacture our products has experienced periods of significant price volatility and has been subject to periodic shortages due to global economic factors.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We have also experienced substantial volatility in prices for other raw materials, including nonferrous metals, chemicals and energy costs.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	At December 31, 2012 , we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 15,050 plaintiffs.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P2_S10	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 41,161 of those claims were dismissed, 20 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts ( two of which are being appealed), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 612 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery, and various other construction projects.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	For example, we have completed and continue to pursue acquisitions in emerging markets including, but not limited to, Brazil, Russia, India and China in order to strategically position resources to increase our presence in growing markets.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S8	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, our revenues and gross margins may suffer.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S10	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S11	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S13	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S14	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S15	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S16	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S17	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S18	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S19	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S20	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S21	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S22	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S23	The loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S24	We have a large and varied customer base due, in part, to our extensive distribution channels in the industries and regions that we serve.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S25	Although no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total Net sales, there are customers to which we sell a large amount of product.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P9_S26	The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our long-term strategy is to continue to increase our market share in growing international markets, particularly Asia (with emphasis in China and India), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia and other developing markets.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	The share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant and growing.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	For example, during 2012 , approximately 8% of our net sales were generated from China and approximately 19% of our property, plant and equipment were located there.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	If the Chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Many developing countries have a significant degree of political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil that may impede our ability to implement and achieve our international growth objectives.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Conducting business internationally subjects us to corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention).
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Failure by the Company or its sales representatives, agents or distributors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified managerial, technical (including research and development), sales and marketing, and customer service personnel.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S8	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Our revenues and results of operations may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S11	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S12	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S15	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S16	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time-consuming and costly.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P12_S17	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	For a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected by significant changes in 2012 , refer to the pension related disclosure under "Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Policies" and Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are subject to changes in the U.S. regulatory environment, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our businesses, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us, our products or the markets in which we operate are newly implemented or changed.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts ) were signed into law.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Acts make broad-based changes to the U.S. health care system, which could significantly affect the U.S. economy and our financial results.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	While the provisions of the Acts are not expected to have any significant short-term impacts, the long-term potential impacts on our business and the consolidated financial statements are currently uncertain.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are currently assessing the potential impact of the Acts.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There is a growing political and scientific belief that emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG") alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the global climate.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These concerns may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Such regulation could result in new or additional regulatory or product standard requirements for the Company's global businesses.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We are unable, at this time, to predict the significance of these requirements as the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standards is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of theorized climate change on the Company's customers, and therefore on the Company's operations, are speculative and highly uncertain, and would be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P24_S7	These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of the Company's operations which we are unable, at this time, to predict.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated locations can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis.
59527_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company has 45 manufacturing facilities, including operations and joint ventures in 19 countries, the locations (grouped by operating segment) of which are as follows: North America Welding:
59527_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Cleveland and Fort Loramie, Ohio; San Diego and Anaheim, California; Reno, Nevada; Baltimore, Maryland; Ladson, South Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee.
59527_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	Shanghai; Jinzhou; Nanjing; Zhengzhou; Luan County.
59527_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	Mason, Ohio; Gainesville, Georgia; Santa Fe Springs, California.
59527_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	All properties relating to the Company's Cleveland, Ohio headquarters and manufacturing facilities are owned by the Company.
59527_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	Most of the Company's foreign subsidiaries own manufacturing facilities in the country where they are located.
59527_13_ITEM2_P5_S1	The Company believes that its existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.
59527_13_ITEM2_P5_S2	At December 31, 2012 , $0.2 million of indebtedness under capital leases was secured by property with a book value of $0.4 million .
59527_13_ITEM2_P5_S3	In addition, the Company maintains operating leases for many of its distribution centers and sales offices throughout the world.
59527_13_ITEM2_P5_S4	See Note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company's lease commitments.
59527_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	At December 31, 2012 , the Company was a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 15,050 plaintiffs, which is a net decrease of three claims from those previously reported.
59527_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	In each instance, the Company is one of a large number of defendants.
59527_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	The asbestos claimants seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified sums.
59527_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	Since January 1, 1995, the Company has been a co-defendant in other similar cases that have been resolved as follows: 41,161 of those claims were dismissed, 20 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts ( two of which are being appealed), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 612 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	In July 2012, the Company received a Notice of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA ) for 2004 to 2011, which would disallow the deductibility of inter-company dividends.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Company disagrees with the position taken by the CRA and believes it is without merit.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company will vigorously contest the assessment through the Tax Court of Canada.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	A trial date has not yet been scheduled.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	In connection with the litigation process, the Company is required to deposit no less than one-half of the tax and interest assessed by the CRA, of which a payment was made in September 2012 and the balance of the tax and interest assessment was made in the quarter ended December 31, 2012.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S4	Any Canadian tax ultimately due will be creditable in the parent company's U.S. federal tax return.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S5	The Company expects to be able to utilize the full amount of foreign tax credits generated in the statutorily allowed carry-back and carry-forward periods.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S6	Accordingly, should the Company not prevail in this dispute, the income statement charge will approximate the deficiency interest, net of tax.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S7	The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the tax position.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S8	In accordance with prescribed recognition and measurement thresholds, no income tax accrual has been made for any uncertain tax positions related to the CRA reassessment.
59527_13_ITEM3_P2_S9	An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements in the period in which a judgment is reached.
59527_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	The total amount of dividends paid in 2012 was $73.1 million .
59527_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	During 2012 , dividends were paid quarterly on January 13, April 13, July 13 and October 15.
59527_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	T he December dividend that the Company would normally pay in January 2013 was paid on December 28, 2012.
59527_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	Quarterly high and low stock prices and dividends declared per share for the last two years were:
59527_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	Issuer purchases of equity securities for the fourth quarter 2012 were:
59527_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	(1) The above share repurchases include the surrender of 18,118 shares of the Company's common stock to satisfy minimum income tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of 45,460 restricted shares granted pursuant to the Company's 2006 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan.
59527_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	(2) The Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 30 million shares of the Company's common stock.
59527_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	Total shares purchased through the share repurchase program were 26,657,627 shares at a cost of $430.1 million for a weighted average cost of $16.13 per share through December 31, 2012 .
59527_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following line graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total shareholder return on the Company's common stock against the cumulative total return of the S P Composite 500 Stock Index ("S P 500") and the S P 400 MidCap Index ("S P 400") for the five-year calendar period commencing January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2012 .
59527_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	This graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2007 in each of the Company's common stock, the S P 500 and the S P 400.
59527_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	A peer-group index for the welding industry, in general, was not readily available because the industry is comprised of a large number of privately held competitors and competitors that are smaller parts of large publicly traded companies.
59527_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	(2) Results for 2011 include rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $282 ($237 after-tax) resulting from rationalization activities primarily initiated in 2009 and a gain of $4,844 related to a favorable adjustment for tax audit settlements.
59527_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	(3) Results for 2010 include rationalization and asset impairment net gains of $384 ($894 after-tax) which include net gains of $3,684 ($3,725 after-tax) related to the sale of property and asset disposals, impairment charges of $883 ($801 after-tax) and $2,417 ($2,030 after-tax) in rationalization charges.

59527_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $23,718 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 37 months .
59527_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable which would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2012 , was $54,178 and $47,464 , respectively.
59527_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $18,776 , $10,028 and $4,270 respectively.
59527_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Product Liability Costs Product liability costs have historically been significant particularly with respect to welding fume claims.
59527_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Costs incurred are volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Product liability costs decreased $2,922 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to reduced trial activity.
59527_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	The long-term impact of the welding fume loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_13_ITEM7_P78_S5	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims.
59527_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	New Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Standards to be Adopted:
59527_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
59527_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
59527_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
59527_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	For other amounts, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.
59527_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	The amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012.
59527_13_ITEM7_P80_S5	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2013-02 on the Company's financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.
59527_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	ASU 2012-02 permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - General Intangibles Other than Goodwill .
59527_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent.
59527_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	In accordance with this update, an entity will have an option not to calculate annually the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset if the entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired.
59527_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
59527_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2012-02 on the Company's financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	ASU 2011-11 requires an entity to disclose information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to offsetting, master netting or other similar arrangements, to illustrate the effect or potential effect of those arrangements on the Company's financial position.
59527_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities , which clarifies the scope of ASU 2011-11.
59527_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.
59527_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	The amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented.
59527_13_ITEM7_P84_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2011-11 on the Company's financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2012 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	The Company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_13_ITEM7_P89_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	The Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	Exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S4	Exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S5	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S6	See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and "Item 3.
59527_13_ITEM7_P91_S7	Legal Proceedings" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of tax contingencies.
59527_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts, and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in "Selling, general administrative expenses" and were $4,608 , $4,904 and $118 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
59527_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP.
59527_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	In remeasuring the financial statements, the official exchange rate for non-essential goods of 4.3 (the "Non-Essential Rate") is used as this is the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations.
59527_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company's Venezuelan operation's balance sheet.
59527_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $31,545 at December 31, 2012 and $6,826 at December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P95_S4	The increased exposure was due to the limited opportunities to convert bolivars into U.S. dollars.
59527_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company's ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors.
59527_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	These include, but are not limited to, the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of any potential devaluation and Venezuelan government price exchange controls.
59527_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	If in the future the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, the Company may realize a loss to earnings.
59527_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	In 2010, the Company participated in Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings as a means of converting bolivars to U.S. dollars.
59527_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The conversion of bolivars to U.S. dollars through Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings generated foreign currency transaction losses as the debt was purchased at the Non-Essential Rate and subsequently sold at a discount.
59527_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	During 2010, the Company acquired $7,672 of Venezuelan sovereign debt at the Non-Essential Rate, which was immediately sold at a discount for $6,022 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	The sale of the Venezuelan sovereign debt resulted in a loss of $1,650 recognized in Selling, general administrative expenses.
59527_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	In 2012 and 2011, the Company was not successful in utilizing this vehicle as a means of converting bolivars to U.S. dollars.
59527_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	The devaluation of the bolivar and the change to the U.S. dollar as the functional currency resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain of $2,632 in "Selling, general administrative expenses" and higher "Cost of goods sold" of $5,755 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2010.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	The Non-Essential Rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to one U.S. dollar.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	The devaluation of the bolivar is expected to result in a foreign currency transaction charge of approximately $8,500 in Selling, general administrative expenses.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	This charge will be recognized during the first quarter of 2013.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S4	The impact of selling inventories carried at the previous exchange rate is expected to decrease gross profit by approximately $4,000 in 2013.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S5	These charges will be recognized during the first half of 2013.
59527_13_ITEM7_P99_S6	The Company also expects that its Venezuelan subsidiary's results of operations will decrease significantly in 2013 due to the new exchange rate.
59527_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_13_ITEM7_P100_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings of $3,776 that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_13_ITEM7_P100_S4	At December 31, 2012 , the Company had approximately $170,175 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	At December 31, 2012 , a valuation allowance of $38,799 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_13_ITEM7_P102_S4	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relates to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 7.7% and 7.9% at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
59527_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_13_ITEM7_P105_S3	The amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense.
59527_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	During 2012 , investment returns were 11.1% compared with a return of 4.1% in 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,800 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption to be used, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA- or better.
59527_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 3.8% at December 31, 2012 and 4.2% at December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P107_S3	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,100 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P107_S4	Pension expense relating to the Company's defined benefit plans was $36,258 , $26,370 and $29,123 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
59527_13_ITEM7_P107_S5	The Company expects 2013 defined benefit pension expense to increase by approximately $200 to $500 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $417,967 as of December 31, 2012 and $408,000 as of December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The increase is primarily the result of an increase in actuarial losses.
59527_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	Actuarial losses arising during 2012 are primarily attributable to a lower discount rate.
59527_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $60,277 , $30,000 and $41,500 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
59527_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $103,000 to its U.S. plans in 2013 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	Based on current pension funding rules, the Company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in 2013 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_13_ITEM7_P112_S2	Actual year-end costs and inventory levels may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.
59527_13_ITEM7_P112_S3	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $72,173 at December 31, 2012 and $78,292 at December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	The fair value of goodwill for all of the Company's operating business units exceeded its carrying value by at least 10% as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of 2012.
59527_13_ITEM7_P121_S3	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM7_P121_S4	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company's stock, the expected life of the stock award and the Company's dividend yield.
59527_13_ITEM7_P122_S2	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_13_ITEM7_P122_S3	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have a direct impact on the Black-Scholes model.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2012 , a 10% change in commodity prices, and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates under the Company's current borrowing arrangements.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at December 31, 2012 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange, commodity price, or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on income before taxes, interest expense, or accumulated other comprehensive loss.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The analysis takes into consideration any offset that would result from changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company's risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	At December 31, 2012 , the Company hedged certain third-party and inter-company purchases and sales.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	At December 31, 2012 , the Company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately $39,597 .
59527_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2012 , a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	These hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices on the Company's open commodity futures at December 31, 2012 would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2012 , the Company had no interest rate swaps outstanding.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Additionally, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, therefore an interest rate increase would have no effect on interest expense.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair value of the Company's Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 approximated carrying value.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company's financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments.
59527_13_ITEM7A_P6_S5	The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.

59527_13_ITEM15_P20_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_13_ITEM15_P20_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
59527_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

59527_13_ITEM15_P22_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM15_P23_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
59527_13_ITEM15_P23_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

59527_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts, and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $4,608 , $4,904 and $118 in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
59527_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
59527_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	In remeasuring the financial statements, the official exchange rate for non-essential goods of 4.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar (the "Non-Essential Rate") is used as this is the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company's Venezuelan operation's balance sheet.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S3	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $31,545 at December 31, 2012 and $6,826 at December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S4	The increased exposure was due to the limited opportunities to convert bolivars into U.S. dollars.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S5	In 2010, the Company participated in Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings as a means of converting bolivars to U.S. dollars.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S6	The conversion of bolivars to U.S. dollars through Venezuelan sovereign debt offerings generated foreign currency transaction losses as the debt was purchased at the Non-Essential Rate and subsequently sold at a discount.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S7	During 2010, the Company acquired $7,672 of Venezuelan sovereign debt at the Non-Essential Rate, which was immediately sold at a discount for $6,022 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S8	The sale of the Venezuelan sovereign debt resulted in a loss of $1,650 recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
59527_13_ITEM15_P36_S9	The devaluation of the bolivar and the change to the U.S. dollar as the functional currency resulted in a foreign currency transaction gain of $2,632 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $5,755 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2010.
59527_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Non-Essential Rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to one U.S. dollar.
59527_13_ITEM15_P37_S2	The devaluation of the bolivar is expected to result in a foreign currency transaction charge of approximately $8,500 in Selling, general administrative expenses.
59527_13_ITEM15_P37_S3	This charge will be recognized during the first quarter of 2013.
59527_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	to decrease gross profit by approximately $4,000 in 2013.
59527_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	These charges will be recognized during the first half of 2013.
59527_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Company also expects that its Venezuelan subsidiary's results of operations will decrease significantly in 2013 due to the new exchange rate.
59527_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
59527_13_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_13_ITEM15_P39_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_13_ITEM15_P39_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
59527_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Equity Investments Investments in businesses in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and holds between a 20% and 50% ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting on a one-month lag basis.
59527_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company's 50% ownership interest in equity investments includes investments in Turkey and Chile.
59527_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of 50% or less owned equity investments was $15,034 at December 31, 2012 and $15,190 at December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment.
59527_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Depreciation and amortization are computed using a straight-line method over useful lives ranging from three to 20 years for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to 50 years for buildings.
59527_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur.
59527_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.
59527_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with long-term construction in progress.
59527_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
59527_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable.
59527_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
59527_13_ITEM15_P50_S3	If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life.
59527_13_ITEM15_P50_S4	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_13_ITEM15_P50_S5	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities, such as the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets and derivative contracts, are valued at fair value using the market and income valuation approaches.
59527_13_ITEM15_P55_S1	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
59527_13_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Company uses the market approach to value similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the income approach that consists of discounted cash flow models that take into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date.
59527_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
59527_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
59527_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
59527_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	If the asset or liability has a specific (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
59527_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
59527_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company accrues for product warranty claims based on historical experience and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty service.
59527_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Warranty services are provided for periods up to three years from the date of sale.
59527_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the customer which generally occurs at point of shipment.
59527_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of Sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.

59527_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps from time to time to hedge changes in the fair value of debt.
59527_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value.
59527_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.
59527_13_ITEM15_P66_S3	For derivative instruments that qualify as a fair value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings.
59527_13_ITEM15_P66_S4	For derivative instruments that qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" with offsetting amounts recorded as "Other current assets," "Other non-current assets," "Other current liabilities" or "Other long-term liabilities" depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	At settlement, the realized gain or loss is reflected in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

59527_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	ASU 2011-08 provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstance leads to the determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
59527_13_ITEM15_P75_S1	If the entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.
59527_13_ITEM15_P75_S2	However, if the entity concludes otherwise, it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test.
59527_13_ITEM15_P75_S3	The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
59527_13_ITEM15_P75_S4	ASU 2011-08 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2012 and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

59527_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	Further, ASU 2011-05 requires the presentation on the face of the financial statements items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented.
59527_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	The amendment to present reclassification adjustments was deferred when the FASB issued ASU 2011-12.
59527_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.

59527_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_13_ITEM15_P207_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_13_ITEM15_P207_S2	Because these estimates are subject to many factors beyond management's control, annual results may differ from interim results as they are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
59527_13_ITEM15_P207_S3	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , approximately 34% and 31% , respectively, of total inventories were valued using the LIFO method.
59527_13_ITEM15_P207_S4	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $72,173 at December 31, 2012 and $78,292 at December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	The Company leases sales offices, warehouses and distribution centers, transportation equipment, office equipment and data processing equipment.
59527_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	Such leases, some of which are noncancelable and, in many cases, include renewals, expire at various dates.
59527_13_ITEM15_P208_S2	The Company pays most insurance, maintenance and taxes relating to leased assets.
59527_13_ITEM15_P208_S3	Rental expense was $17,751 in 2012 , $15,221 in 2011 and $14,155 in 2010 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P208_S4	At December 31, 2012 , total future minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases were $12,624 in 2013 , $9,385 in 2014 , $6,872 in 2015 , $5,695 in 2016 , $4,561 in 2017 and $7,082 thereafter.
59527_13_ITEM15_P208_S5	The following table summarizes assets held under capital leases and included in property, plant and equipment:
59527_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_13_ITEM15_P209_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_13_ITEM15_P209_S2	The claimants in the asbestos cases seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts.
59527_13_ITEM15_P209_S3	The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to contest such suits vigorously.
59527_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	The Company's accrual for contingent liabilities was $5,636 as of December 31, 2012 and $11,312 as of December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P210_S1	The Company also recognized an asset for recoveries from insurance carriers related to the insured claims outstanding of $1,311 as of December 31, 2012 and $4,516 as of December 31, 2011 .
59527_13_ITEM15_P210_S2	The decrease in the accrual for contingent liabilities is primarily due to a payment made in conjunction with the agreement entered into in January 2012 that provides for the dismissal with prejudice of substantially all of the pending manganese claims.
59527_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	The decrease in the asset for recoveries from insurance carriers reflects the collection of insurance receivables.
59527_13_ITEM15_P211_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_13_ITEM15_P211_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_13_ITEM15_P212_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_13_ITEM15_P212_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_13_ITEM15_P212_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_13_ITEM15_P212_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_13_ITEM15_P212_S5	Based on the Company's historical experience in litigating product liability claims, including a significant number of dismissals, summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts, as well as the Company's current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, the Company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_13_ITEM15_P213_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of product warranty accruals for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

59527_13_ITEM15_P214_S1	The quarter ended September 30, 2012 includes rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $3,059 ( $2,704 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America Welding, Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments.
59527_13_ITEM15_P214_S2	The quarter ended June 30, 2012 includes rationalization net charges of $1,258 ( $915 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America Welding, Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments and a charge of $1,381 ( $906 after-tax) related to a change in Venezuelan labor law, which provides for increased employee severance obligations in the South America Welding segment.
59527_13_ITEM15_P214_S3	The quarter ended June 30, 2011 includes rationalization and asset impairment net gains of $75 ( $44 after-tax) primarily related to the gain on sale of assets at rationalized operations in the Asia Pacific Welding segment resulting from actions initiated in 2009.
59527_13_ITEM15_P214_S4	The quarter ended March 31, 2011 includes rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $357 ( $281 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in the Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments resulting from actions initiated in 2009 and a gain of $4,844 related to a favorable adjustment for tax audit settlements in the North America Welding segment.
59527_13_ITEM15_P215_S0	The quarterly earnings per share ("EPS") amounts are each calculated independently.
59527_13_ITEM15_P215_S1	Therefore, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not equal the annual totals.

59527_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2013 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer's knowledge: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the Report.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and assigning appropriate consideration for such risks.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S11	The Company's operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Further recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for the Company's products, thereby impacting our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S11	At December 31, 2013 , we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 14,601 plaintiffs.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P2_S12	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 41,832 of those claims were dismissed, 22 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts ( one of which is being appealed), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 633 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	For example, we have completed and continue to pursue acquisitions in emerging markets including, but not limited to, Brazil, Russia, India and China in order to strategically position resources to increase our presence in growing markets.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S11	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, our revenues and gross margins may suffer.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S12	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S13	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S14	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S15	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S16	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S17	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S18	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S19	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S20	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S21	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S22	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S23	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S24	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P9_S25	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have a large and varied customer base due, in part, to our extensive distribution channels in the industries and regions that we serve.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Although no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total net sales, there are customers to which we sell a large amount of product.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our long-term strategy is to continue to increase our market share in growing international markets, particularly Asia (with emphasis in China and India), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia and other developing markets.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant and growing.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	For example, during 2013 , approximately 8% of our net sales were generated from China and approximately 17% of our property, plant and equipment were located there.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If the Chinese economy were to experience a significant slowdown, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Many developing countries have a significant degree of political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil that may impede our ability to implement and achieve our international growth objectives.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Conducting business internationally subjects us to corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention).
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Failure by the Company or its sales representatives, agents or distributors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In particular, the economic and political environment in Venezuela exposes us to various risks.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Currency exchange restrictions limit our ability to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars, which impacts our ability to repatriate earnings and to purchase goods and services necessary to operate our Venezuelan business.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The restrictions could cause a slowdown, temporary shutdown or complete shutdown of operations at our Venezuelan subsidiary, which could negatively affect our earnings and cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified managerial, technical (including research and development), sales and marketing, and customer service personnel.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S11	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Our revenues and results of operations may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S14	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S15	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S16	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P12_S17	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time-consuming and costly.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected by significant changes in 2013 , refer to the pension related disclosure under "Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Policies" and Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are subject to changes in the U.S. regulatory environment, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our businesses, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us, our products or the markets in which we operate are newly implemented or changed.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	New or revised laws, regulations or standards could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is a growing political and scientific belief that emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG") alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the global climate.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	These concerns may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Such regulation could result in new or additional regulatory or product standard requirements for the Company's global businesses.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	We are unable, at this time, to predict the significance of these requirements as the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standards is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of theorized climate change on the Company's customers, and therefore on the Company's operations, are speculative and highly uncertain, and would be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	These may include changes in weather patterns (including drought and rainfall levels), water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P22_S7	These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of the Company's operations which we are unable, at this time, to predict.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated locations can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis.
59527_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company has 48 manufacturing facilities, including operations and joint ventures in 19 countries, the significant locations (grouped by operating segment) of which are as follows: North America Welding:
59527_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Cleveland and Fort Loramie, Ohio; San Diego and Anaheim, California; Reno, Nevada; Baltimore, Maryland; Ladson, South Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee.
59527_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	Shanghai; Jinzhou; Nanjing; Zhengzhou; Luan County.
59527_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	Mason, Ohio; Gainesville, Georgia; Santa Fe Springs, California.
59527_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	All properties relating to the Company's Cleveland, Ohio headquarters and manufacturing facilities are owned by the Company.
59527_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	Most of the Company's foreign subsidiaries own manufacturing facilities in the country where they are located.
59527_14_ITEM2_P5_S1	The Company believes that its existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.
59527_14_ITEM2_P5_S2	In addition, the Company maintains operating leases for many of its distribution centers and sales offices throughout the world.
59527_14_ITEM2_P5_S3	See Note 16 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company's lease commitments.
59527_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the Company was a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 14,601 plaintiffs, which is a net decrease of 455 claims from those previously reported.
59527_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	In each instance, the Company is one of a large number of defendants.
59527_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	The asbestos claimants seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified sums.
59527_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	Since January 1, 1995, the Company has been a co-defendant in other similar cases that have been resolved as follows: 41,832 of those claims were dismissed, 22 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts ( one of which is being appealed), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 633 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	In July 2012, the Company received a Notice of Reassessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA ) for 2004 to 2011, which would disallow the deductibility of inter-company dividends.
59527_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	These adjustments would increase Canadian federal and provincial tax due.
59527_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Company disagrees with the position taken by the CRA and believes it is without merit.
59527_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	The Company will vigorously contest the assessment through the Tax Court of Canada.
59527_14_ITEM3_P1_S4	A trial date has not yet been scheduled.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	In connection with the litigation process, the Company is required to deposit no less than one-half of the tax and interest assessed by the CRA.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S1	The Company has elected to deposit the entire amount of the dispute in order to suspend the continuing accrual of a 5% interest charge.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S2	Any Canadian tax ultimately due will be creditable in the parent company's U.S. federal tax return.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S3	The Company expects to be able to utilize the full amount of foreign tax credits generated in the statutorily allowed carry-back and carry-forward periods.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S4	Accordingly, should the Company not prevail in this dispute, the income statement charge will approximate the deficiency interest, net of tax.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S5	The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the tax position.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S6	In accordance with prescribed recognition and measurement thresholds, no income tax accrual has been made for any uncertain tax positions related to the CRA reassessment.
59527_14_ITEM3_P2_S7	An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements in the period in which a judgment is reached.
59527_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The total amount of dividends paid in 2013 was $49.3 million .
59527_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	During 2013 , dividends were paid on April 15, July 15 and October 15.
59527_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	The dividend that the Company would normally have paid in January 2013 was paid on December 28, 2012.
59527_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	Quarterly high and low stock prices and dividends declared per share for the last two years were:
59527_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Issuer purchases of equity securities for the fourth quarter 2013 were:
59527_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	(1) The above share repurchases include the surrender of 19,059 shares of the Company's common shares in connection with the vesting of restricted shares granted pursuant to the Company's 2006 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan.
59527_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	(2) On July 26, 2013, the Company announced a new share repurchase program, which increased the total number the Company s common shares authorized to be repurchased to 45 million shares of the Company's common stock.
59527_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	Total shares purchased through the share repurchase program were 29,329,241 shares at a cost of $594.9 million for a weighted average cost of $20.28 per share through December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following line graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total shareholder return on the Company's common stock against the cumulative total return of the S P Composite 500 Stock Index ("S P 500") and the S P 400 MidCap Index ("S P 400") for the five-year calendar period commencing January 1, 2009 and ending December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	This graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2008 in each of the Company's common shares, the S P 500 and the S P 400.
59527_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	A peer-group index for the welding industry, in general, was not readily available because the industry is comprised of a large number of privately held competitors and competitors that are smaller parts of large publicly traded companies.
59527_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	(1) Results for 2013 include rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $8,463 ( $7,573 after-tax) which include $3,658 ( $2,965 after-tax) in rationalization charges and impairment charges net of gains on disposals of $4,805 ( $4,608 after-tax).
59527_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	Results also include a charge of $12,198 ( $12,198 after-tax) related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and a loss of $705 ( $705 after-tax) related to a loss on the sale of land.
59527_14_ITEM6_P0_S2	Associated with the impairment of long-lived assets and loss on the sale of land is an offsetting special item of $1,068 representing portions attributable to non-controlling interests.
59527_14_ITEM6_P0_S3	(3) Results for 2011 include rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $282 ($237 after-tax) resulting from rationalization activities primarily initiated in 2009 and a gain of $4,844 related to a favorable adjustment for tax audit settlements.

59527_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market.
59527_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The Company's financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding.
59527_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Where possible, the Company utilizes operational cash flows and raises capital in the most efficient market, usually the U.S., and then lends funds to the specific subsidiary that requires funding.
59527_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	If additional acquisitions providing appropriate financial benefits become available, additional expenditures may be made.
59527_14_ITEM7_P43_S5	The Company's debt levels decreased from $20,275 at December 31, 2012 to $19,087 at December 31, 2013 .

59527_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Canada - Notice of Reassessment As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in July 2012, the Company received a Notice of Reassessment from the CRA for 2004 to 2011, which would disallow the deductibility of inter-company dividends.
59527_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	These adjustments would increase Canadian federal and provincial tax due by $58,824 plus approximately $16,022 of interest, net of tax.
59527_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company disagrees with the position taken by the CRA and believes it is without merit.
59527_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The Company will vigorously contest the assessment through the Tax Court of Canada.
59527_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	A trial date has not yet been scheduled.
59527_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	In connection with the litigation process, the Company is required to deposit no less than one half of the tax and interest assessed by the CRA.
59527_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The Company has elected to deposit the entire amount of the dispute in order to suspend the continuing accrual of a 5% interest charge.
59527_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Additionally, deposited amounts will earn interest of approximately 1% due upon a favorable outcome.
59527_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	A deposit was made in 2012 and is recorded as a non-current asset as of December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	Although the Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the tax position, the ultimate outcome of the assessment remains uncertain.

59527_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	Pro forma information related to these acquisitions has not been presented because the impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income is not material.
59527_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Acquired companies are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition.
59527_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Debt At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $4,212 and $1,919 , respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment.
59527_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.
59527_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	The Company has a line of credit totaling $300,000 through the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which was entered into on July 26, 2012 .

59527_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	The Credit Agreement has a five -year term and may be increased, subject to certain conditions, by an additional amount up to $100,000 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The interest rate on borrowings is based on either LIBOR or the prime rate, plus a spread based on the Company s leverage ratio, at the Company s election.
59527_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Short-term Borrowings The Company's short-term borrowings included in Amounts due banks were $14,581 and $18,220 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and represent the borrowings of foreign subsidiaries at weighted average interest rates of 11.3% and 11.3% , respectively.

59527_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , there was $25,907 of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits.
59527_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.
59527_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
59527_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute approximately $20,000 to the U.S. pension plans in 2014 .

59527_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	In addition, on April 28, 2006, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended ("Director Plan"), which replaced the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors adopted in 2000.
59527_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	The Director Plan provides for the granting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units up to an additional 600,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	At December 31, 2013 , there were 2,315,239 common shares available for future grant under all plans.
59527_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 357,494 in 2013 , 567,023 in 2012 and 648,561 in 2011 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Company issued shares of common stock from treasury upon all exercises of stock options and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $9,734 , $8,961 and $6,610 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	The related tax benefit for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $3,727 , $3,409 and $2,515 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $21,633 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.3 years .
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S5	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable which would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2013 , was $85,404 and $76,076 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P73_S6	The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $20,297 , $18,776 and $10,028 respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Product Liability Costs Product liability costs have historically been significant particularly with respect to asbestos claims.
59527_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Costs incurred are volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	Product liability costs decreased $767 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to reduced trial activity.
59527_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims.
59527_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	New Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Standards to be Adopted:
59527_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	ASU 2013-11 requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with limited exceptions.
59527_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
59527_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	Early adoption and retrospective application is permitted.
59527_14_ITEM7_P77_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2013-11, but does not expect it will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	ASU 2013-05 clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment under current U.S. GAAP by emphasizing that the accounting for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income for sales or transfers of a controlling financial interest within a foreign entity is the same irrespective of whether the sale or transfer is of a subsidiary or a group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or business.
59527_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	When a reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity, the parent is required to apply the guidance in Subtopic 830-30 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income.
59527_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	The amendments are effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2013.
59527_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2013-05 on the Company's financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P80_S2	The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	Exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	Exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S6	See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements and the "Item 3.
59527_14_ITEM7_P85_S7	Legal Proceedings" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of tax contingencies.
59527_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_14_ITEM7_P86_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $7,759 , $4,608 and $4,904 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP.
59527_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	Effective February 13, 2013 the official rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	The devaluation of the bolivar resulted in a foreign currency transaction loss of $8,081 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $4,117 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate.
59527_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	In January 2014, the Venezuelan government announced the formation of the National Center of Foreign Trade ("CENCOEX") to replace the Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange ("CADIVI").
59527_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	In addition, the government announced the CENCOEX would utilize the rate used in the SICAD auction-based exchange rate program (the "SICAD rate") for certain transactions as opposed to the official rate.
59527_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	Transactions executed at the SICAD rate most recently used a rate of 11.7 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	In February 2014, the government announced a new foreign exchange system, SICAD 2, which is expected to use a currency mechanism based on bond swaps.
59527_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	At this time, the Company expects to continue to use the official rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar to translate its Venezuelan subsidiary's financial results.
59527_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	The Company will continue to assess the information available relative to Venezuelan exchange rates, however, the future impact on the Company's financial statements is uncertain.
59527_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company's Venezuelan operation's balance sheet.
59527_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $38,633 at December 31, 2013 , which includes $50,642 of cash and cash equivalents, and $31,545 at December 31, 2012 , which includes $32,610 of cash and cash equivalents.
59527_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	The increased exposure was due to the limited opportunities to convert bolivars into U.S. dollars.
59527_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The Company's ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors.
59527_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	These include, but are not limited to, the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of any potential devaluation and Venezuelan government price exchange controls.
59527_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	If in the future the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised, the Company may realize a loss to earnings.
59527_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	For example, a future devaluation in the Venezuelan currency to a rate of 12.6 would result in the Company realizing additional charges of approximately $3,000 to Cost of goods sold based on current inventory levels and $20,000 to Selling, general and administrative expenses based upon the current bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position.
59527_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	Additionally, the various restrictions on the distribution of foreign currency by the Venezuelan government could affect the Company's ability to pay obligations and maintain normal production levels in Venezuela.
59527_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings of $8,354 that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_14_ITEM7_P96_S4	At December 31, 2013 , the Company had approximately $102,128 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	At December 31, 2013 , a valuation allowance of $49,684 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_14_ITEM7_P97_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_14_ITEM7_P97_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relates to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 7.4% and 7.7% at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_14_ITEM7_P101_S3	The amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense.
59527_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	During 2013 , investment returns were 12.4% compared with a return of 11.1% in 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,900 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA- or better.
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 4.7% at December 31, 2013 and 3.8% at December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S3	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,100 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S4	Pension expense relating to the Company's defined benefit plans was $29,908 , $36,258 and $26,370 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S5	The Company expects 2014 defined benefit pension expense to decrease by a range of approximately $15,000 to $18,000 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S6	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $256,260 as of December 31, 2013 and $417,967 as of December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S7	The decrease is primarily the result of actuarial gains recorded during the year.
59527_14_ITEM7_P103_S8	Actuarial gains arising during 2013 are primarily attributable to a higher discount rate.
59527_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $75,216 , $60,277 and $30,000 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $20,000 to its U.S. plans in 2014 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	Based on current pension funding rules, the Company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in 2014 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_14_ITEM7_P105_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	Actual year-end costs and inventory levels may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.
59527_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $70,882 at December 31, 2013 and $72,173 at December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_14_ITEM7_P109_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_14_ITEM7_P109_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_14_ITEM7_P113_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_14_ITEM7_P114_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_14_ITEM7_P115_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM7_P116_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_14_ITEM7_P116_S2	The fair value of goodwill for all of the Company's operating business units exceeded its carrying value by at least 20% as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of 2013.
59527_14_ITEM7_P116_S3	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM7_P116_S4	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company's stock, the expected life of the stock award and the Company's dividend yield.
59527_14_ITEM7_P117_S2	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_14_ITEM7_P117_S3	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have a direct impact on the Black-Scholes model.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2013 , a 10% change in commodity prices, and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates under the Company's current borrowing arrangements.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at December 31, 2013 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange, commodity price, or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on income before taxes, interest expense, or accumulated other comprehensive loss.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The analysis takes into consideration any offset that would result from changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company's risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the Company hedged certain third-party and inter-company purchases and sales.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	At December 31, 2013 , the Company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately $36,880 .
59527_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2013 , a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	These hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices on the Company's open commodity futures at December 31, 2013 would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had no interest rate swaps outstanding.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Additionally, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, therefore an interest rate increase would have no effect on interest expense.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The fair value of the Company's Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 approximated carrying value.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company's financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments.
59527_14_ITEM7A_P6_S5	The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
59527_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
59527_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on the 1992 framework in "Internal Control Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
59527_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the Company's evaluation under such framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
59527_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
59527_14_ITEM10_P0_S0	Except for the information set forth within Part I, Item 1C section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K concerning our Executive Officers, the information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the 2014 proxy statement.
59527_14_ITEM12_P0_S0	For further information on the Company's equity compensation plans, see Note 1 and Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P0_S0	The following consolidated financial statement schedule of the Company is included in a separate section of this report following the signature page: Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not required under the related instructions or are inapplicable, and therefore, have been omitted.

59527_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.
59527_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P23_S2	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index as Item 15 (a) (2).

59527_14_ITEM15_P23_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
59527_14_ITEM15_P23_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_14_ITEM15_P23_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
59527_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
59527_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_14_ITEM15_P24_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

59527_14_ITEM15_P24_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	We have audited Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria).
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A.
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
59527_14_ITEM15_P25_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
59527_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	In our opinion, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the COSO criteria.

59527_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	Welding products include arc welding power sources, wire feeding systems, robotic welding packages, fume extraction equipment, consumable electrodes and fluxes.
59527_14_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company's product offering also includes computer numeric controlled ("CNC") plasma and oxy-fuel cutting systems, regulators and torches used in oxy-fuel welding, cutting and brazing and consumables used in the brazing and soldering alloys market.
59527_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $7,759 , $4,608 and $4,904 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
59527_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
59527_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	Effective February 13, 2013 the official rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	The devaluation of the bolivar resulted in a foreign currency transaction loss of $8,081 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $4,117 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate.
59527_14_ITEM15_P40_S3	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company's consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company's Venezuelan operation's balance sheet.
59527_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $38,633 at December 31, 2013 , which includes $50,642 of cash and cash equivalents and $31,545 at December 31, 2012 , which includes $32,610 of cash and cash equivalents.
59527_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	The increased exposure was due to the limited opportunities to convert bolivars into U.S. dollars.
59527_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
59527_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Accounts Receivable The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_14_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_14_ITEM15_P43_S2	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
59527_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	Equity Investments Investments in businesses in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and holds between a 20% and 50% ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
59527_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company's 50% ownership interest in equity investments includes investments in Turkey and Chile.
59527_14_ITEM15_P49_S2	The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of 50% or less owned equity investments was $16,694 at December 31, 2013 and $15,034 at December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment.
59527_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Depreciation and amortization are computed using a straight-line method over useful lives ranging from three to 20 years for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to 50 years for buildings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur.
59527_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.
59527_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with long-term construction in progress.
59527_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
59527_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable.
59527_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
59527_14_ITEM15_P54_S3	If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life.
59527_14_ITEM15_P54_S4	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_14_ITEM15_P54_S5	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities, such as the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets and derivative contracts, are valued at fair value using the market and income valuation approaches.
59527_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
59527_14_ITEM15_P60_S2	The Company uses the market approach to value similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the income approach that consists of discounted cash flow models that take into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date.
59527_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
59527_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
59527_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
59527_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	If the asset or liability has a specific (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
59527_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
59527_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company accrues for product warranty claims based on historical experience and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty service.
59527_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	Warranty services are provided for periods up to three years from the date of sale.
59527_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the customer which generally occurs at point of shipment.
59527_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of Sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including warehousing and freight related to product shipments, are included in Cost of goods sold.
59527_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P70_S2	Common stock issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options is excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the calculation of option equivalent shares is anti-dilutive.
59527_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	Financial Instruments The Company uses forward contracts to hedge exposures to commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations on certain purchase and sales transactions, balance sheet and net investment exposures.
59527_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	Contracts are generally written on a short-term basis but may cover exposures for up to two years and are not held for trading or speculative purposes.
59527_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps from time to time to hedge changes in the fair value of debt.
59527_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value.
59527_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.
59527_14_ITEM15_P72_S3	For derivative instruments that qualify as a fair value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P72_S4	For derivative instruments that qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	At settlement, the realized gain or loss is reflected in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	Any remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P73_S2	For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the instruments is recognized in earnings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to Selling, general administrative expenses as incurred and totaled $42,126 , $37,305 and $32,834 in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.

59527_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	Bonus costs were $123,571 in 2013 , $124,947 in 2012 and $104,361 in 2011 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
59527_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
59527_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to current year classifications.
59527_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	New Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Standards to be Adopted:
59527_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	ASU 2013-11 requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with limited exceptions.
59527_14_ITEM15_P80_S1	The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
59527_14_ITEM15_P80_S2	Early adoption and retrospective application is permitted.
59527_14_ITEM15_P80_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2013-11, but does not expect it will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	ASU 2013-05 clarifies the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment under current U.S. GAAP by emphasizing that the accounting for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income for sales or transfers of a controlling financial interest within a foreign entity is the same irrespective of whether the sale or transfer is of a subsidiary or a group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or business.

59527_14_ITEM15_P180_S6	Accordingly, should the Company not prevail in this dispute, the income statement charge will approximate the deficiency interest, net of tax.
59527_14_ITEM15_P180_S7	The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the tax position.
59527_14_ITEM15_P180_S8	In accordance with prescribed recognition and measurement thresholds, no income tax accrual has been made for any uncertain tax positions related to the CRA reassessment.
59527_14_ITEM15_P180_S9	An unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements in the quarter in which a judgment is reached.
59527_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	NOTE 13 DERIVATIVES The Company uses derivatives to manage exposures to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices arising in the normal course of business.
59527_14_ITEM15_P181_S1	Derivative contracts to hedge currency and commodity exposures are generally written on a short-term basis but may cover exposures for up to two years while interest rate contracts may cover longer periods consistent with the terms of the underlying debt.
59527_14_ITEM15_P181_S2	The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
59527_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	All derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
59527_14_ITEM15_P182_S1	The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
59527_14_ITEM15_P182_S2	The Company formally documents the relationship of the hedge with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy for all designated hedges.
59527_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable.
59527_14_ITEM15_P183_S1	If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued.
59527_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	The cash flows from settled derivative contracts are recognized in operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_14_ITEM15_P184_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial for the three years ended December 31, 2013.
59527_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments.
59527_14_ITEM15_P185_S1	Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions.
59527_14_ITEM15_P185_S2	The Company manages individual counterparty exposure by monitoring the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the counterparty.
59527_14_ITEM15_P185_S3	None of the concentrations of risk with any individual counterparty was considered significant at December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges.
59527_14_ITEM15_P187_S1	The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these short-term contracts was $36,880 at December 31, 2013 and $39,597 at December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P187_S2	The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified to Cost of goods sold or Sales for hedges of purchases and sales, respectively, as the underlying hedged transactions affected earnings.
59527_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	Net investment hedges The Company had a foreign currency forward contract that qualified as a designated net investment hedge.
59527_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	No such contract was outstanding as of December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P188_S2	The effective portion of the fair value gain or loss on these net investment hedges were recognized in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to Selling, general and administrative expenses when the underlying hedged investment was liquidated.
59527_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Company has certain foreign exchange forward contracts which are not designated as hedges.
59527_14_ITEM15_P189_S1	These derivatives are held as economic hedges of certain balance sheet exposures.
59527_14_ITEM15_P189_S2	The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these contracts was $186,158 at December 31, 2013 and $189,259 at December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P189_S3	The fair value gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.

59527_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	The effects of designated cash flow hedges on AOCI and the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of the following:
59527_14_ITEM15_P193_S0	The Company expects a gain of $369 related to existing contracts to be reclassified from AOCI, net of tax, to earnings over the next 12 months as the hedged transactions are realized.
59527_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	The following table provides a summary of fair value assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2013 measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
59527_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	The following table provides a summary of fair value assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
59527_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	The Company's derivative contracts are valued at fair value using the market approach.
59527_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	The Company measures the fair value of foreign exchange contracts using Level 2 inputs based on observable spot and forward rates in active markets.
59527_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	The Company measures the fair value of commodity contracts using Level 2 inputs through observable market transactions in active markets provided by financial institutions.
59527_14_ITEM15_P198_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3.
59527_14_ITEM15_P198_S2	In connection with an acquisition, the Company recorded a contingent consideration fair valued at $5,375 as of December 31, 2013 , which reflects a $481 increase in the liability from December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P198_S3	The contingent consideration is based upon estimated sales for the five -year period ending December 31, 2015 and will be paid in 2016 based on actual sales during the period.
59527_14_ITEM15_P198_S4	The fair value of the contingent consideration is a Level 3 valuation and fair valued using a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis.
59527_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	In connection with an acquisition, the Company obtained a controlling financial interest in the acquired entity and at the same time entered into a contract to obtain the remaining financial interest in the entity over a three -year period.
59527_14_ITEM15_P199_S1	The amount to be paid to obtain the remaining financial interest will be based upon actual financial results of the entity.
59527_14_ITEM15_P199_S2	A liability was recorded for the contract at a fair value of $16,974 as of December 31, 2013 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P199_S3	The fair value of the contract is a Level 3 valuation and is based on the present value of the expected future payments.
59527_14_ITEM15_P199_S4	The expected future payments are based on a multiple of forecast earnings and cash flows over the three-year period ending December 31, 2016, present valued utilizing a risk based discount rate.
59527_14_ITEM15_P199_S5	The present value calculations utilized an average discount rate of 16.3% and annual earnings growth rates ranging from 14.8% to 18.8% .
59527_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	The deferred compensation liability is the Company's obligation under its executive deferred compensation plan.
59527_14_ITEM15_P200_S1	The Company measures the fair value of the liability using the market values of the participants' underlying investment fund elections.
59527_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	The Company has various financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-and long-term debt and forward contracts.
59527_14_ITEM15_P201_S1	While these financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk, the Company has minimized this risk by entering into arrangements with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in several high-quality instruments.
59527_14_ITEM15_P201_S2	The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_14_ITEM15_P202_S0	The fair value of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable," "Amounts due banks" and "Trade accounts payable" approximated book value due to the short-term nature of these instruments at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P202_S1	See Note 8 for the fair value estimate of debt.
59527_14_ITEM15_P203_S0	NOTE 15 INVENTORY For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the LIFO method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the FIFO method.
59527_14_ITEM15_P204_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_14_ITEM15_P204_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_14_ITEM15_P204_S2	Because these estimates are subject to many factors beyond management's control, annual results may differ from interim results as they are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
59527_14_ITEM15_P204_S3	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , approximately 38% and 34% , respectively, of total inventories were valued using the LIFO method.
59527_14_ITEM15_P204_S4	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $70,882 at December 31, 2013 and $72,173 at December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Company leases sales offices, warehouses and distribution centers, transportation equipment, office equipment and information technology equipment.
59527_14_ITEM15_P205_S1	Such leases, some of which are noncancelable and, in many cases, include renewals, expire at various dates.
59527_14_ITEM15_P205_S2	The Company pays most insurance, maintenance and taxes relating to leased assets.
59527_14_ITEM15_P205_S3	Rental expense was $18,642 in 2013 , $17,751 in 2012 and $15,221 in 2011 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P205_S4	At December 31, 2013 , total future minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases were $13,263 in 2014 , $10,391 in 2015 , $8,240 in 2016 , $5,637 in 2017 , $4,071 in 2018 and $6,568 thereafter.
59527_14_ITEM15_P205_S5	The following table summarizes assets held under capital leases and included in property, plant and equipment:
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S0	NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S2	The claimants in the asbestos cases seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts.
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S3	The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to contest such suits vigorously.
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S4	The Company's accrual for contingent liabilities was $2,735 as of December 31, 2013 and $5,636 as of December 31, 2012 .
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S5	The accrual is included in Other current liabilities.
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S6	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_14_ITEM15_P206_S7	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_14_ITEM15_P207_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_14_ITEM15_P207_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_14_ITEM15_P207_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_14_ITEM15_P207_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_14_ITEM15_P207_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_14_ITEM15_P207_S5	Based on the Company's historical experience in litigating product liability claims, including a significant number of dismissals, summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts, as well as the Company's current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, the Company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_14_ITEM15_P208_S0	The changes in product warranty accruals for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 were as follows:
59527_14_ITEM15_P209_S0	The quarter ended December 31, 2013 includes rationalization and impairment net charges of $259 ( $223 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America Welding, Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments and a charge of $705 related to a loss on the sale of land in the Asia Pacific Welding segment.

59527_14_ITEM15_P210_S0	The quarter ended December 31, 2012 includes rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $5,037 ( $3,823 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America Welding, Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments.
59527_14_ITEM15_P210_S1	The quarter ended September 30, 2012 includes rationalization and asset impairment net charges of $3,059 ( $2,704 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America Welding, Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments.
59527_14_ITEM15_P210_S2	The quarter ended June 30, 2012 includes rationalization net charges of $1,258 ( $915 after-tax) primarily related to employee severance and other costs associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations in North America Welding, Europe Welding and Asia Pacific Welding segments and a charge of $1,381 ( $906 after-tax) related to a change in Venezuelan labor law, which provides for increased employee severance obligations in the South America Welding segment.
59527_14_ITEM15_P211_S0	The quarterly earnings per share ("EPS") amounts are each calculated independently.
59527_14_ITEM15_P211_S1	Therefore, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not equal the annual totals.

59527_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2014 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer's knowledge: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the Report.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and allocating appropriate resources to address such risks.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S10	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Further recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thereby impacting our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	At December 31, 2014 , we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 14,634 plaintiffs.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P2_S12	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 42,296 of those claims were dismissed, 22 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts (one of which was vacated on appeal), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 670 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	For example, we have completed and continue to pursue acquisitions in emerging markets including, but not limited to, Brazil, Russia, India and China in order to strategically position resources to increase our presence in growing markets.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S10	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P9_S11	Our ability to complete the divestiture of assets, or interests in assets, may be subject to factors beyond our control, and in certain cases we may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We may identify assets for strategic divestitures that would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets or complete announced divestitures, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the assets on terms and at prices acceptable to us.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Also, as is typical in divestitures, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, our revenues and gross margins may suffer.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P12_S10	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	The loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We have a large and varied customer base due, in part, to our extensive distribution channels in the industries and regions that we serve.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Although no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total net sales, there are customers to which we sell a large amount of product.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P13_S7	The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse affect on our revenue, gross margins and profit.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our long-term strategy is to continue to increase our market share in growing international markets.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If international economies were to experience significant slowdowns, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Many developing countries have a significant degree of political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil that may impede our ability to implement and achieve our international growth objectives.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Conducting business internationally subjects us to corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention).
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Failure by the Company or its sales representatives, agents or distributors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In particular, the economic and political environment in Venezuela exposes us to various risks.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Currency exchange restrictions limit our ability to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars, which impacts our ability to repatriate earnings and to purchase goods and services necessary to operate our Venezuelan business.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The restrictions could cause a slowdown, temporary shutdown or complete shutdown of operations at our Venezuelan subsidiary, which could negatively affect our earnings and cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract, and retain highly qualified managerial, technical (including research and development), sales and marketing, and customer service personnel.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S11	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S13	Our revenues and results of operations may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S14	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S15	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S16	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P16_S17	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time consuming and costly.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	For a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected by significant changes in 2014 , refer to the pension related disclosure under "Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Policies" and Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to changes in the U.S. regulatory environment, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our businesses, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us, our products or the markets in which we operate are newly implemented or changed.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	New or revised laws, regulations or standards could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our ability to operate our business and execute our strategies.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Significant fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	There is a growing political and scientific belief that emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHG") alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the global climate.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, are considering ways to reduce GHG emissions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These concerns may lead to international, national, regional or local legislative or regulatory responses in the future.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Such regulation could result in new or additional regulatory or product standard requirements for the Company's global businesses.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We are unable, at this time, to predict the significance of these requirements as the impact of any future GHG legislative, regulatory or product standards is dependent on the timing and design of the mandates or standards.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of theorized climate change on the Company's customers, and therefore on the Company's operations, are speculative and highly uncertain, and would be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographical regions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	These potential physical effects may adversely impact the cost, production, sales and financial performance of the Company's operations which we are unable, at this time, to predict.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated locations can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis.

59527_15_ITEM7_P55_S5	Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 22,909 in 2014 , 357,494 in 2013 and 567,023 in 2012 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Company issued common shares from treasury upon all exercises of stock options and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $8,416 , $9,734 and $8,961 , respectively with a related tax benefit of $3,222 , $3,727 and $3,409 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $12,452 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.0 years .
59527_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable which would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2014 , was $65,873 and $64,161 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $14,647 , $26,288 and $25,936 respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Product Liability Costs Product liability costs have historically been significant particularly with respect to asbestos claims.
59527_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Costs incurred are volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims.
59527_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
59527_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2014 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	Exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	Exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S5	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_15_ITEM7_P67_S6	See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further discussion of tax contingencies.
59527_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $22,351 , $7,759 and $4,608 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP.
59527_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Effective February 13, 2013 the official rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	In 2013, the devaluation of the bolivar resulted in a foreign currency transaction loss of $8,081 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $4,117 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate.
59527_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced the formation of the National Center of Foreign Trade ( CENCOEX ) to replace the Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange ( CADIVI ).
59527_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Effective January 24, 2014, the exchange rate applicable to the settlement of certain transactions through CENCOEX, including payments of dividends and royalties, changed to utilize the Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration ("SICAD") auction-based exchange rate (the "SICAD I rate") as opposed to the official rate.
59527_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	Further, in January 2014, the Venezuelan government also enacted the "Fair Prices Law" limiting prices and establishing a maximum profit margin on goods and services.
59527_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	In February 2014, the government announced a new market based foreign exchange system, the SICAD II.
59527_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	The exchange rate established through SICAD II fluctuates daily and is significantly higher than both the official rate and the SICAD I rate.
59527_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SICAD I rate as future remittances for dividend payments could be transacted at the SICAD I rate.
59527_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	As of March 31, 2014, the SICAD I rate was 10.7 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a remeasurement loss on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $17,665 which was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2014.
59527_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	Additionally, the Company incurred higher Cost of goods sold of $3,468 during the second quarter of 2014 related to the adoption of the SICAD I rate.
59527_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The SICAD I rate is determined by periodic auctions which may result in additional losses or gains on a remeasurement of the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position.
59527_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ( SIMADI ), which will replace the SICAD II exchange and allow for trading based on supply and demand.
59527_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	An initial exchange rate for the SIMADI market was established at approximately 170.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	While there remains considerable uncertainty as to the nature and volume of transactions that will flow through the various currency exchange mechanisms, the Company determined that the SICAD I rate remained the most appropriate exchange rate for the Company to utilize in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the SICAD I rate was 12.0 bolivars to the U.S dollar.
59527_15_ITEM7_P77_S4	If in the future the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the SICAD I rate the Company may realize additional losses or gains to earnings.
59527_15_ITEM7_P77_S5	At December 31, 2014 , the amount of bolivar requests awaiting government approval to be paid in U.S. dollars at the SICAD I rate include $8,446 for dividend payments, of which $4,386 have been outstanding for more than a year, and $7,904 to be paid at the official rate, of which $7,661 have been outstanding for more than a year.
59527_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	In the 2014 , the Company s Venezuela operations contributed $71,793 to Net sales for the Company.
59527_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Net income included a loss of $8,238 , or $0.10 per diluted share from Venezuela.
59527_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Adjusted net income for the 2014 included $13,279 , or $0.17 per diluted share, from Venezuela.
59527_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the applied currency exchange mechanisms, the movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company s Venezuelan operation s balance sheet.
59527_15_ITEM7_P78_S4	The bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position was $1,264 at December 31, 2014 , which includes $2,124 of cash and cash equivalents and the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $38,633 at December 31, 2013 , which includes $50,642 of cash and cash equivalents.
59527_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company s ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors.
59527_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	In addition to those factors previously mentioned, these include the Company s ability to mitigate the effect of any potential future devaluation and Venezuelan government price or exchange controls.
59527_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	For example, a future devaluation in the Venezuelan currency to the SIMADI rate would result in the Company realizing additional charges of approximately $22,000 to Cost of goods sold based on December 31, 2014 inventory levels and gains of approximately $1,000 to Selling, general and administrative expenses based upon the December 31, 2014 bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position.
59527_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	The various restrictions on the distribution of foreign currency by the Venezuelan government could also affect the Company s ability to pay obligations and maintain normal productions levels in Venezuela.
59527_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_15_ITEM7_P80_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings of $16,032 that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_15_ITEM7_P80_S4	At December 31, 2014 , the Company had approximately $94,797 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	At December 31, 2014 , a valuation allowance of $48,840 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_15_ITEM7_P81_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_15_ITEM7_P82_S4	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 7.3% and 7.4% at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	The amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense.
59527_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	During 2014 , investment returns were 11.5% compared with a return of 12.4% in 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $2,100 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA or an equivalent quality.
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 4.1% at December 31, 2014 and 4.7% at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,200 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S4	Pension expense relating to the Company's defined benefit plans was $12,395 , $29,908 and $36,258 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S5	The Company expects 2015 defined benefit pension expense to increase by a range of approximately $10,000 to $12,000 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S6	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $314,411 as of December 31, 2014 and $256,260 as of December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S7	The increase is primarily the result of actuarial losses recorded during the year.
59527_15_ITEM7_P87_S8	Actuarial losses arising during 2014 are primarily attributable to a lower discount rate and the adoption of new mortality tables.
59527_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $21,175 , $75,216 and $60,277 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $21,000 to the U.S. plans in 2015 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Based on current pension funding rules, the Company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in 2015 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	Actual year-end costs and inventory levels may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.
59527_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $71,311 at December 31, 2014 and $70,882 at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_15_ITEM7_P96_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM7_P97_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_15_ITEM7_P97_S2	The fair value of goodwill for all of the Company's operating business units exceeded its carrying value by at least 10% as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of 2014.
59527_15_ITEM7_P97_S3	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM7_P97_S4	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	During 2014, the Company identified long-lived assets for planned divestiture.
59527_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	In anticipation of the divestiture, the Company reviewed the carrying values and future cash flows of certain long-lived assets for potential impairment.
59527_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	The Company determined that for certain assets, including the planned divestiture, the carrying values of the assets exceeded the fair values resulting in non-cash impairment charges of $32,617 recorded in Rationalization and asset impairment charges.
59527_15_ITEM7_P101_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the assets identified for divestiture were classified as held for sale.
59527_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company's common shares, the expected life of the stock award and the Company's dividend yield.
59527_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have an impact on the Black-Scholes model.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2014 , a 10% change in commodity prices, and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The contractual derivative, borrowing and investment arrangements in effect at December 31, 2014 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange, commodity price, or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on income before taxes, interest expense, or accumulated other comprehensive loss.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The analysis takes into consideration any offset that would result from changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company's risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.

59527_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These hedging arrangements have the effect of fixing for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices on the Company's open commodity futures at December 31, 2014 would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	A hypothetical 1.0% increase in interest rates would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company uses interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk.
59527_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding during 2014 or 2013.

59527_15_ITEM15_P11_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
59527_15_ITEM15_P11_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_15_ITEM15_P11_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
59527_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
59527_15_ITEM15_P12_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
59527_15_ITEM15_P12_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_15_ITEM15_P12_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	We have audited Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A.
59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
59527_15_ITEM15_P13_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
59527_15_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
59527_15_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

59527_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_15_ITEM15_P24_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $22,351 , $7,759 and $4,608 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
59527_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Effective February 13, 2013 the official rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_15_ITEM15_P28_S2	In 2013, the devaluation of the bolivar resulted in a foreign currency transaction loss of $8,081 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $4,117 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate.
59527_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced the formation of the National Center of Foreign Trade ( CENCOEX ) to replace the Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange ( CADIVI ).
59527_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Effective January 24, 2014, the exchange rate applicable to the settlement of certain transactions through CENCOEX, including payments of dividends and royalties, changed to utilize the Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration ("SICAD") auction-based exchange rate (the "SICAD I rate") as opposed to the official rate.
59527_15_ITEM15_P29_S2	Further, in January 2014, the Venezuelan government also enacted the "Fair Prices Law" limiting prices and establishing a maximum profit margin on goods and services.
59527_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	In February 2014, the government announced a new market based foreign exchange system, the SICAD II.
59527_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	The exchange rate established through SICAD II fluctuates daily and is significantly higher than both the official rate and the SICAD I rate.
59527_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	As of March 31, 2014, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SICAD I rate as future remittances for dividend payments could be transacted at the SICAD I rate.
59527_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	As of March 31, 2014, the SICAD I rate was 10.7 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a remeasurement loss on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $17,665 which was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2014.
59527_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	Additionally, the Company incurred higher Cost of goods sold of $3,468 during the second quarter of 2014 related to the adoption of the SICAD I rate.
59527_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	The SICAD I rate is determined by periodic auctions which may result in additional losses or gains on a remeasurement of the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ( SIMADI ), which will replace the SICAD II exchange and allow for trading based on supply and demand.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	An initial exchange rate for the SIMADI market was established at approximately 170.0 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S2	While there remains considerable uncertainty as to the nature and volume of transactions that will flow through the various currency exchange mechanisms, the Company determined that the SICAD I rate remained the most appropriate exchange rate for the Company to utilize in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2014 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the SICAD I rate was 12.0 bolivars to the U.S dollar.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S4	If in the future the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the SICAD I rate the Company may realize additional losses or gains to earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S5	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the applied currency exchange mechanisms, the movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company s Venezuelan operation s balance sheet.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S6	The bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position was $1,264 at December 31, 2014 , which includes $2,124 of cash and cash equivalents and the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $38,633 at December 31, 2013 , which includes $50,642 of cash and cash equivalents.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S7	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S8	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S9	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_15_ITEM15_P33_S10	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
59527_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
59527_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Equity Investments Investments in businesses in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and holds between a 20% and 50% ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
59527_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	The Company's 50% ownership interest in equity investments includes investments in Turkey and Chile.
59527_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of 50% or less owned equity investments was $18,542 at December 31, 2014 and $16,694 at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment.
59527_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Depreciation and amortization are computed using a straight-line method over useful lives ranging from three to 20 years for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to 50 years for buildings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur.
59527_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.
59527_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with long-term construction in progress.
59527_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
59527_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable.
59527_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
59527_15_ITEM15_P44_S3	If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life.
59527_15_ITEM15_P44_S4	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_15_ITEM15_P44_S5	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation multiples and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities, such as the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets and derivative contracts, are valued at fair value using the market and income valuation approaches.
59527_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
59527_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	The Company uses the market approach to value similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the income approach that consists of discounted cash flow models that take into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date.
59527_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
59527_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
59527_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
59527_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	If the asset or liability has a specific (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
59527_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
59527_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company accrues for product warranty claims based on historical experience and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty service.
59527_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	Warranty services are provided for periods up to three years from the date of sale.
59527_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the customer which generally occurs at point of shipment.
59527_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of Sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including warehousing and freight related to product shipments, are included in Cost of goods sold.
59527_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_15_ITEM15_P60_S2	Common stock issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options is excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the calculation of option equivalent shares is anti-dilutive.
59527_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company uses forward contracts to hedge exposures to commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations on certain purchase and sales transactions, balance sheet and net investment exposures.
59527_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	Contracts are generally written on a short-term basis but may cover exposures for up to two years and are not held for trading or speculative purposes.
59527_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps from time to time to hedge changes in the fair value of debt.
59527_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value.
59527_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.
59527_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	For derivative instruments that qualify as a fair value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P62_S4	For derivative instruments that qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	At settlement, the realized gain or loss is reflected in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	Any remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	For derivative instruments that qualify as a net investment hedge (i.e., hedging the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation), the effective portion of the gain or loss on this derivative instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_15_ITEM15_P63_S3	The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified to Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as the underlying hedged investment is liquidated.
59527_15_ITEM15_P63_S4	For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the instruments is recognized in earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to Selling, general administrative expenses as incurred and totaled $43,256 , $42,126 and $37,305 in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	Bonus Included in Selling, general administrative expenses are the costs related to the Company's discretionary employee bonus programs, which for certain U.S.-based employees are net of hospitalization costs.
59527_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	Bonus costs were $128,478 in 2014 , $123,571 in 2013 and $124,947 in 2012 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
59527_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
59527_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to current year classifications.
59527_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
59527_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	To achieve that core principle, the amendment provides five steps that an entity should apply when recognizing revenue.
59527_15_ITEM15_P70_S2	The amendment also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers.
59527_15_ITEM15_P70_S3	An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application.

59527_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	At December 31, 2014 , a valuation allowance of $48,840 was recorded against certain deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_15_ITEM15_P159_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_15_ITEM15_P159_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_15_ITEM15_P160_S1	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P160_S2	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings of $16,032 that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	Unrecognized Tax Benefits Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are classified as "Accrued taxes" non-current unless expected to be paid in one year.
59527_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	Current income tax expense included income of $1,406 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and an expense of $492 for the year ended December 31, 2013 for interest and penalties.
59527_15_ITEM15_P161_S2	For those same years, the Company's accrual for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $8,019 and $10,257 , respectively.
59527_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:
59527_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $9,132 at December 31, 2014 and $13,739 at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S1	With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S2	The Company is currently subject to various U.S. state audits and non-U.S. income tax audits.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S3	The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until after the close of an audit.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S4	The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S5	Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits and closing of statutes of limitations.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S6	Based on information currently available, management believes that additional audit activity could be completed and/or statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits.
59527_15_ITEM15_P164_S7	It is reasonably possible there could be a further reduction of $3,901 in prior years' unrecognized tax benefits in 2015 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	In July 2012, the Company received a Notice of Reassessment (the "Reassessments") from the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA ) in respect to its 2004 to 2010 taxation years to disallow the deductibility of inter-company dividends.
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S1	The Company appealed the Reassessments to the Tax Court of Canada.
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S2	As part of the appeals process to the Tax Court of Canada, the Company had elected to deposit the entire amount of the dispute in order to suspend continuing interest charges.
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S3	In September 2014, the Department of Justice Canada consented to a judgment, wholly in the Company's favor.
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S4	In vacating the reassessment, this tax litigation is concluded.
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S5	In December 2014 the Company received a partial refund of the cash deposit with a value of $50,282 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S6	The Company also received interest on the deposit of $1,236 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P165_S7	The Company expects the balance of the cash deposit of $27,068 , recorded in Other current assets as of December 31, 2014 , plus 1% annual interest to be received in the first quarter of 2015.
59527_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	NOTE 13 DERIVATIVES The Company uses derivatives to manage exposures to currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices arising in the normal course of business.
59527_15_ITEM15_P166_S1	Derivative contracts to hedge currency and commodity exposures are generally written on a short-term basis but may cover exposures for up to two years while interest rate contracts may cover longer periods consistent with the terms of the underlying debt.
59527_15_ITEM15_P166_S2	The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
59527_15_ITEM15_P166_S3	All derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
59527_15_ITEM15_P166_S4	The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
59527_15_ITEM15_P166_S5	The Company formally documents the relationship of the hedge with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy for all designated hedges.
59527_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable.
59527_15_ITEM15_P167_S1	If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued.
59527_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	The cash flows from settled derivative contracts are recognized in operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_15_ITEM15_P168_S1	Hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial for the three years ended December 31, 2014.
59527_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments.

59527_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges.
59527_15_ITEM15_P171_S1	The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these short-term contracts was $27,265 at December 31, 2014 and $36,880 at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and subsequently reclassified to Cost of goods sold or Sales for hedges of purchases and sales, respectively, as the underlying hedged transactions affected earnings.
59527_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	Net investment hedges The Company has foreign currency forward contracts that qualify and are designated as net investment hedges.
59527_15_ITEM15_P173_S1	The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these short-term contracts was $60,734 at December 31, 2014 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P173_S2	The effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these net investment hedges are recognized in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to Selling, general and administrative expenses, as the underlying hedged investment is liquidated.
59527_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Company has certain foreign exchange forward contracts which are not designated as hedges.
59527_15_ITEM15_P174_S1	These derivatives are held as economic hedges of certain balance sheet exposures.
59527_15_ITEM15_P174_S2	The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these contracts was $280,949 at December 31, 2014 and $186,158 at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P174_S3	The fair value gains or losses from these contracts are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
59527_15_ITEM15_P174_S4	The Company has short-term silver and copper forward contracts with notional amounts of 275,000 troy ounces and 375,000 pounds, respectively, at December 31, 2014 and notional amounts of 290,000 troy ounces and 375,000 pounds, respectively, at December 31, 2013 .

59527_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The Company measures the fair value of foreign exchange contracts using Level 2 inputs based on observable spot and forward rates in active markets.
59527_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	The Company measures the fair value of commodity contracts using Level 2 inputs through observable market transactions in active markets provided by financial institutions.
59527_15_ITEM15_P183_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , there were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3.
59527_15_ITEM15_P183_S2	In connection with an acquisition, the Company recorded a contingent consideration fair valued at $6,912 as of December 31, 2014 , which reflects a $1,537 increase in the liability from December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P183_S3	The contingent consideration is based upon estimated sales for the five -year period ending December 31, 2015 and will be paid in 2016 based on actual sales during the period.
59527_15_ITEM15_P183_S4	The fair value of the contingent consideration is a Level 3 valuation and fair valued using a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis.
59527_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	In connection with an acquisition, the Company obtained a controlling financial interest in the acquired entity and at the same time entered into a contract to obtain the remaining financial interest in the entity over a three -year period.
59527_15_ITEM15_P184_S1	The amount to be paid to obtain the remaining financial interest will be based upon actual financial results of the acquired entity.
59527_15_ITEM15_P184_S2	A liability was recorded for the Canadian dollar denominated forward contract at a fair value of $25,268 as of December 31, 2014 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P184_S3	The change in the liability resulted in $8,244 being recognized in interest expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	The fair value of the contract is a Level 3 valuation and is based on the present value of the expected future payments.
59527_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	The expected future payments are based on a multiple of forecast earnings and cash flows over the three-year period ending December 31, 2016, present valued utilizing a risk based discount rates of 3.5% reflective of the Company's cost of debt and 15.9% as a risk adjusted cost of capital and annual earnings before interest and taxes with growth rates ranging from 16.5% to 37.8% .

59527_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	The Company has various financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-and long-term debt and forward contracts.
59527_15_ITEM15_P188_S1	While these financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk, the Company has minimized this risk by entering into arrangements with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in several high-quality instruments.
59527_15_ITEM15_P188_S2	The Company does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	The fair value of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Accounts receivable," "Amounts due banks" and "Trade accounts payable" approximated book value due to the short-term nature of these instruments at both December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P189_S1	See Note 8 for the fair value estimate of debt.
59527_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	NOTE 15 INVENTORY For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the LIFO method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the FIFO method.
59527_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_15_ITEM15_P191_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_15_ITEM15_P191_S2	Because these estimates are subject to many factors beyond management's control, annual results may differ from interim results as they are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation.
59527_15_ITEM15_P191_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , approximately 40% and 38% , respectively, of total inventories were valued using the LIFO method.
59527_15_ITEM15_P191_S4	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $71,311 at December 31, 2014 and $70,882 at December 31, 2013 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	The Company leases sales offices, manufacturing facilities, warehouses and distribution centers, transportation equipment, office equipment and information technology equipment.
59527_15_ITEM15_P192_S1	Such leases, some of which are noncancelable and, in many cases, include renewals, expire at various dates.
59527_15_ITEM15_P192_S2	The Company pays most insurance, maintenance and taxes relating to leased assets.
59527_15_ITEM15_P192_S3	Rental expense was $18,103 in 2014 , $18,642 in 2013 and $17,751 in 2012 .
59527_15_ITEM15_P192_S4	At December 31, 2014 , total future minimum lease payments for noncancelable operating leases were $12,372 in 2015 , $10,672 in 2016 , $7,895 in 2017 , $5,425 in 2018 , $4,126 in 2019 and $3,906 thereafter.
59527_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	Assets held under capital leases are included in property, plant and equipment and are immaterial.
59527_15_ITEM15_P194_S0	NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_15_ITEM15_P194_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_15_ITEM15_P195_S0	The claimants in the asbestos cases seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts.
59527_15_ITEM15_P195_S1	The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to contest such suits vigorously.
59527_15_ITEM15_P196_S0	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_15_ITEM15_P196_S1	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure is provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_15_ITEM15_P197_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_15_ITEM15_P197_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_15_ITEM15_P197_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_15_ITEM15_P197_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_15_ITEM15_P197_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_15_ITEM15_P197_S5	Based on the Company's historical experience in litigating product liability claims, including a significant number of dismissals, summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts, as well as the Company's current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, the Company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_15_ITEM15_P198_S0	The changes in product warranty accruals for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

59527_15_ITEM15_P201_S0	The quarterly earnings per share ("EPS") amounts are each calculated independently.
59527_15_ITEM15_P201_S1	Therefore, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not equal the annual totals.

59527_16_ITEM1_P136_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2015 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer's knowledge: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the Report.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and allocating appropriate resources to address such risks.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S10	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Further recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P1_S13	An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S11	As of December 31, 2015 , we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 8,415 plaintiffs.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P2_S12	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 49,677 of those claims were dismissed, 22 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts (one of which was vacated on appeal), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 748 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Even if we are successful defending such claims or product liability coverage is adequate, claims of this nature could cause customers to lose confidence in our products and our company.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be able to complete our acquisition or divestiture strategies, successfully integrate acquired businesses and in certain cases we may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	For example, we have completed and continue to pursue acquisitions in emerging markets in order to strategically position resources to increase our presence in growing markets.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Additionally, from time to time we may identify assets for strategic divestitures that would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets or complete announced divestitures, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the assets on terms and at prices acceptable to us.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Also, as is typical in divestitures, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenues, gross margins and results of operations may suffer.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time consuming and costly.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S7	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S9	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S10	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions and improve our overall competitiveness.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S12	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S15	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S16	In addition, in certain markets of the world, distributors manufacture and sell arc welding products.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S17	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S18	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S19	Our long-term strategy is to continue to increase our market share in growing international markets.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S20	The share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P12_S21	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If international economies were to experience significant slowdowns, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Many developing countries have a significant degree of political and economic uncertainty and social turmoil that may impede our ability to implement and achieve our international growth objectives.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Conducting business internationally subjects us to corporate governance and management challenges in consideration of the numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings and funds, exchange controls, labor regulations, nationalization, anti-boycott provisions and anti-bribery laws (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention).
59527_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Failure by the Company or its sales representatives, agents or distributors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, all or any of which could negatively impact our business and reputation.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our foreign operations also subject us to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In particular, the economic and political environment in Venezuela exposes us to various risks.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Currency exchange restrictions limit our ability to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars, which impacts our ability to repatriate earnings and to purchase goods and services necessary to operate our Venezuelan business.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	The restrictions could cause a slowdown, temporary shutdown or complete shutdown of operations at our Venezuelan subsidiary, which could negatively affect our earnings and cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the future, the Company may need to deconsolidate its Venezuelan operations as a result of an inability to exchange bolivar-denominated cash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The Company monitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company s ability to manage its Venezuelan operation s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and economic situation within Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2015 , the Company continues to consolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's total investment in Venezuela was approximately $35,000 , which includes intercompany payables.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified managerial and technical (including research and development) personnel.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S8	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P16_S10	For a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected by significant changes in 2015 , refer to the pension related disclosure under "Part II, Item 7 Critical Accounting Policies" and Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are subject to changes in the global regulatory environment, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our businesses, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us, our products or the markets in which we operate are newly implemented or changed.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	New or revised laws, regulations or standards could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our ability to operate our business and execute our strategies.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact our operating income.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Although our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Significant fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividend and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries within a country imposing controls.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Currency devaluations result in diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems, which contain confidential information related to our customers, suppliers and employees and other proprietary business information.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We maintain some of these systems and are also dependent on a number of critical corporate infrastructure services provided by third parties relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and finance functions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Furthermore, a security breach could result in unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any of these could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S6	If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S7	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S8	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P25_S9	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate rationalization actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Throughout 2015, we implemented rationalization plans and incurred employee severance and other related costs totaling $13,719 .
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	For more information regarding our rationalization plans, refer to the rationalization and asset impairment related disclosure under Note 6 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We may take additional actions in the future to further optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but are not be limited to asset impairments, employee severance costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension settlements, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future rationalization plans in full or in part or within the time periods we expect.
59527_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.

59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S6	In the first quarter of 2015, the Company received a refund of $24,976 which was substantially all of the remaining cash deposit.
59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S7	The Company also received interest on the deposit of $1,596 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S8	Rationalization and Asset Impairments In 2015 , the Company recorded net rationalization and asset impairment charges of $19,958 resulting from rationalization activities.
59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S9	The 2015 net charges include $13,719 primarily related to employee severance and other related costs and $6,315 in an impairment charge to the carrying value of goodwill In 2014 , the Company recorded net rationalization and asset impairment charges of $30,053 resulting from rationalization activities.
59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S10	The 2014 net charges include $1,241 primarily related to employee severance and other related costs and $32,742 in asset impairment charges, partially offset by gains from sales of assets of $3,930 .

59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S12	The 2013 net charges include $3,658 primarily related to employee severance and other related costs and $4,961 in asset impairment charges, partially offset by gains from sales of assets $156.
59527_16_ITEM7_P47_S13	Fair values of impaired assets were determined using projected discounted cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Acquisitions Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's recent acquisitions.
59527_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Debt At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $342,602 and $9,323 , respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment.
59527_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.
59527_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Senior Unsecured Notes On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it agreed to issue the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000 through a private placement.
59527_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	At December 31, 2015 , $349,147, net of debt issuance costs of $853, was outstanding and recorded in Long-term debt, less current portion.
59527_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.
59527_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Notes have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.5%, excluding accretion of original issuance costs, and an average tenure of 19 years.
59527_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants.
59527_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
59527_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company has a line of credit totaling $400,000 through the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which was entered into on September 12, 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, transactions with affiliates and a fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio.
59527_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
59527_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	The Credit Agreement has a five -year term and may be increased, subject to certain conditions, by an additional amount up to $100,000 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	The interest rate on borrowings is based on either LIBOR or the prime rate, plus a spread based on the Company s leverage ratio, at the Company s election.
59527_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	Short-term Borrowings The Company's short-term borrowings included in Amounts due banks were $2,822 and $61,155 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	Amounts due banks included the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the borrowings of foreign subsidiaries at weighted average interest rates of 24.1% and 3.1% at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Return on Invested Capital The Company reviews return on invested capital ("ROIC") in assessing and evaluating the Company's underlying operating performance.
59527_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC.
59527_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital.
59527_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Amounts due banks, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity.
59527_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
59527_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a tabular reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted net income.
59527_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:

59527_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , there was $14,332 of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and a $23,201 liability for deferred compensation.
59527_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur.
59527_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	See Note 12 and Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
59527_16_ITEM7_P60_S3	Additionally, in connection with prior acquisitions, there were liabilities with fair values as of December 31, 2015 of $9,184 for a contingent consideration arrangement and $26,484 for a forward contract to acquire an additional ownership interest in a majority owned subsidiary.
59527_16_ITEM7_P60_S4	The amount of future cash flows associated with these liabilities will be contingent upon actual results of the acquired entities.
59527_16_ITEM7_P60_S5	See Note 14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
59527_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $20,000 to the U.S. defined benefit plans in 2016 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	On April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan ("Employee Plan"), which replaced the 2006 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended ("EPI Plan").
59527_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Employee Plan provides for the granting of options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance-based awards up to an additional 5,400,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	In addition, on April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2015 Director Plan"), which replaced the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2006 Director Plan").
59527_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	The 2015 Director Plan provides for the granting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units up to an additional 300,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	At December 31, 2015 , there were 5,600,763 common shares available for future grant under all plans.
59527_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 411,406 in 2015 , 22,909 in 2014 and 357,494 in 2013 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The Company issued common shares from treasury upon all exercises of stock options and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $7,932 , $8,416 and $9,734 , respectively, with a related tax benefit of $3,037 , $3,222 and $3,727 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $15,371 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.9 years .
59527_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable which would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2015 was $30,121 and $30,121 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $6,879 , $14,647 and $26,288 respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Product Liability Costs Product liability costs incurred are volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims.
59527_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
59527_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2015 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_16_ITEM7_P70_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure would be provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_16_ITEM7_P72_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_16_ITEM7_P72_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	The Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	Exposures are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S4	Exposures can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S5	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for income tax exposures; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_16_ITEM7_P74_S6	See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further discussion of tax contingencies.
59527_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $6,023 , $22,351 and $7,759 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP.
59527_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Effective February 13, 2013 the official rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	In 2013, the devaluation of the bolivar resulted in a foreign currency transaction loss of $8,081 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $4,117 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced the formation of the National Center of Foreign Trade ( CENCOEX ) to replace the Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange ( CADIVI ).
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	Effective January 24, 2014, the exchange rate applicable to the settlement of certain transactions through CENCOEX, including payments of dividends and royalties, changed to utilize the Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration ("SICAD") auction-based exchange rate (the "SICAD rate") as opposed to the official rate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	Further, in January 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted the "Fair Prices Law" limiting prices and establishing a maximum profit margin on goods and services.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S3	In February 2014, the government announced a new market based foreign exchange system, the SICAD II.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S4	The exchange rate established through SICAD II fluctuated daily and was significantly higher than both the official rate and the SICAD rate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S5	As of March 31, 2014, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SICAD rate as future remittances for dividend payments could be transacted at the SICAD rate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S6	As of March 31, 2014, the SICAD rate was 10.7 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a remeasurement loss on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $17,665 which was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2014.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S7	Additionally, the Company incurred higher Cost of goods sold of $3,468 during the second quarter of 2014 related to the adoption of the SICAD rate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S8	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government eliminated the SICAD II rate and announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ("SIMADI"), which allows for trading based on supply and demand.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S9	At September 30, 2015, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SIMADI rate as it most appropriately approximates the rates used to transact business in its Venezuelan operations.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S10	At September 30, 2015, the SIMADI rate was 199.4 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a remeasurement charge on the bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position of $4,334 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S11	This foreign exchange loss was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S12	Additionally, the Company recorded lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of $22,880 within Cost of goods sold, related to the adoption of the SIMADI rate.
59527_16_ITEM7_P80_S13	As of December 31, 2015 , the SIMADI rate was 198.7 bolivars to the U.S dollar.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	If the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the SIMADI rate, the Company may realize additional losses or gains to earnings.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	At December 31, 2015 , the amount of bolivar requests awaiting government approval to be paid in U.S. dollars at the SIMADI rate include $1,550 for dividend payments, of which $510 have been outstanding for more than a year, and $7,871 to be paid at the official rate, all of which have been outstanding for more than a year.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	In 2015 , the Company s Venezuela operations contributed $84,662 to Net sales for the Company.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	Net income included a loss of $24,005 , or $0.32 per diluted share from Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S4	Adjusted net income for 2015 included $3,209 , or $0.05 per diluted share, from Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S5	In 2014 , the Company s Venezuela operations contributed $71,793 to Net sales for the Company.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S6	Net income included a loss of $8,238 , or $0.10 per diluted share, from Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S7	Adjusted net income for 2014 included $13,279 , or $0.17 per diluted share, from Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S8	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the applied currency exchange mechanisms, the movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company s Venezuelan operation s balance sheet.
59527_16_ITEM7_P81_S9	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $32 at December 31, 2015 , which includes $642 of cash and cash equivalents and the bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position was $1,264 at December 31, 2014 , which includes $2,124 of cash and cash equivalents.
59527_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company s ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors.
59527_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	In addition to those factors previously mentioned, these include the Company s ability to mitigate the effect of any potential future devaluation and Venezuelan government price or exchange controls.
59527_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	The various restrictions on the distribution of foreign currency by the Venezuelan government could also affect the Company s ability to pay obligations and maintain normal production levels in Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	In the future, the Company may need to deconsolidate its Venezuelan operations as a result of an inability to exchange bolivar-denominated cash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Company monitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company s ability to manage its Venezuelan operation s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing and labor relations; and the current political and economic situation within Venezuela.
59527_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2015 , the Company continues to consolidate its Venezuelan subsidiary.
59527_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's total investment in Venezuela was approximately $35,000 , which includes intercompany payables.
59527_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed permanently reinvested.
59527_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings that are not expected to be permanently reinvested were not significant.
59527_16_ITEM7_P84_S4	At December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately $92,537 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	At December 31, 2015 , a valuation allowance of $51,294 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	The Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_16_ITEM7_P85_S4	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit ("Pension") and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_16_ITEM7_P86_S4	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_16_ITEM7_P88_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 6.3% and 7.3% at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	The amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense.
59527_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	During 2015 , investment returns were 0.9% compared with a return of 11.5% in 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $2,000 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA or an equivalent quality.
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 4.5% at December 31, 2015 and 4.1% at December 31, 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S3	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,500 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S4	Pension expense relating to the Company's defined benefit plans was $162,815 , $12,395 and $29,908 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S5	Pension expense in 2015 includes $142,738 in settlement charges.
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S6	The Company expects 2016 defined benefit pension expense, excluding the effect of settlements, to decrease by a range of approximately $1,000 to $3,000 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S7	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $154,756 as of December 31, 2015 and $314,411 as of December 31, 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S8	The decrease is primarily the result of pension settlement charges recorded in 2015 related to the purchase of a group annuity contract.
59527_16_ITEM7_P91_S9	Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
59527_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $47,124 , $21,175 and $75,216 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	The Company expects to voluntarily contribute $20,000 to the U.S. plans in 2016 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	Based on current pension funding rules, the Company does not anticipate that contributions to the plans would be required in 2016 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
59527_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	Actual year-end costs and inventory levels may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.
59527_16_ITEM7_P95_S3	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $59,765 at December 31, 2015 and $71,311 at December 31, 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_16_ITEM7_P97_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_16_ITEM7_P99_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	Due to the presence of impairment indicators during the third quarter of 2015, the Company performed an impairment test of certain long-lived assets of a business unit.
59527_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	The Company determined that for certain long-lived assets the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value, resulting in a $3,417 non-cash impairment charge.
59527_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	This result was considered a possible indication of goodwill impairment, therefore, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test, using a combination of income and market valuation approaches, resulting in a $6,315 non-cash impairment charge to the carrying value of goodwill.
59527_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	The fair value of goodwill for all of the Company's reporting units exceeded its carrying value by at least 20% as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of 2015.
59527_16_ITEM7_P105_S3	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM7_P105_S4	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company's common shares, the expected life of the stock award and the Company's dividend yield.
59527_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_16_ITEM7_P106_S3	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have an impact on the Black-Scholes model.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2015 , a 10% change in commodity prices, and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The contractual derivative, borrowing and investment arrangements in effect at December 31, 2015 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange, commodity price, or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on income before taxes, interest expense, or accumulated other comprehensive loss.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The analysis takes into consideration any offset that would result from changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company's risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At December 31, 2015 , the Company hedged certain third-party and inter-company purchases and sales.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	At December 31, 2015 , the Company had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately $30,388 .
59527_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	At December 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These hedging arrangements have the effect of fixing for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices on the Company's open commodity futures at December 31, 2015 would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	A hypothetical 1.0% increase in interest rates would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company uses interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The Company had no interest rate derivatives outstanding during 2015 or 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company's return on cash and cash equivalents are also subject to interest rate risk.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had $304,183 in cash and cash equivalents.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S4	A hypothetical change of 1.0% in interest rates would not materially affect the Company's financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S5	The fair value of the Company's Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 approximated carrying value.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S6	The Company's financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S7	The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments.
59527_16_ITEM7A_P6_S8	The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
59527_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
59527_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the 2013 framework in "Internal Control Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
59527_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the Company's evaluation under such framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015 .
59527_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
59527_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.
59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 .
59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S2	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index as Item 15 (a) (2).
59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S3	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_16_ITEM15_P14_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
59527_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM15_P15_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
59527_16_ITEM15_P15_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_16_ITEM15_P15_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_16_ITEM15_P15_S4	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
59527_16_ITEM15_P15_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S1	We have audited Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S2	Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A.
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
59527_16_ITEM15_P16_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
59527_16_ITEM15_P17_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
59527_16_ITEM15_P17_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P17_S4	In our opinion, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on the COSO criteria.
59527_16_ITEM15_P17_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

59527_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_16_ITEM15_P27_S2	Foreign currency transaction losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were $6,023 , $22,351 and $7,759 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
59527_16_ITEM15_P28_S1	As a result, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation are reported under highly inflationary accounting rules as of January 1, 2010.
59527_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company's Venezuelan operation have been remeasured into the Company's reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings.
59527_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
59527_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Effective February 13, 2013 the official rate moved from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar.
59527_16_ITEM15_P30_S2	In 2013, the devaluation of the bolivar resulted in a foreign currency transaction loss of $8,081 in Selling, general administrative expenses and higher Cost of goods sold of $4,117 due to the liquidation of inventory valued at the historical exchange rate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	In January 2014, the Venezuela government announced the formation of the National Center of Foreign Trade ( CENCOEX ) to replace the Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange ( CADIVI ).
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	Effective January 24, 2014, the exchange rate applicable to the settlement of certain transactions through CENCOEX, including payments of dividends and royalties, changed to utilize the Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration ("SICAD") auction-based exchange rate (the "SICAD rate") as opposed to the official rate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S2	Further, in January 2014, the Venezuelan government enacted the "Fair Prices Law" limiting prices and establishing a maximum profit margin on goods and services.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S3	In February 2014, the government announced a new market based foreign exchange system, the SICAD II.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S4	The exchange rate established through SICAD II fluctuated daily and was significantly higher than both the official rate and the SICAD rate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S5	As of March 31, 2014, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SICAD rate as future remittances for dividend payments could be transacted at the SICAD rate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S6	As of March 31, 2014, the SICAD rate was 10.7 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a remeasurement loss on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $17,665 which was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2014.
59527_16_ITEM15_P31_S7	Additionally, the Company incurred higher Cost of goods sold of $3,468 during the second quarter of 2014 related to the adoption of the SICAD rate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government eliminated the SICAD II rate and announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ( SIMADI ), which allows for trading based on supply and demand.
59527_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	At September 30, 2015, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SIMADI rate as it most appropriately approximates the rates used to transact business in its Venezuelan operations.
59527_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	At September 30, 2015, the SIMADI rate was 199.4 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a remeasurement charge on the bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position of $4,334 .
59527_16_ITEM15_P32_S3	This foreign exchange loss was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015.
59527_16_ITEM15_P32_S4	Additionally, the Company recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of $22,880 within Cost of goods sold, related to the adoption of the SIMADI rate.
59527_16_ITEM15_P32_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , the SIMADI rate was 198.7 bolivars to the U.S dollar.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	If the Company were to convert bolivars at a rate other than the SIMADI rate, the Company may realize additional losses or gains to earnings.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela on the Company s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the applied currency exchange mechanisms, the movements in the applicable exchange rates between the bolivar and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in the Company s Venezuelan operation s balance sheet.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	The bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position was $32 at December 31, 2015 , including $642 of cash and cash equivalents and the bolivar-denominated monetary net liability position was $1,264 at December 31, 2014 , including $2,124 of cash and cash equivalents.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S3	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S4	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S5	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_16_ITEM15_P33_S6	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
59527_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	For most domestic inventories, cost is determined principally by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, and for non-U.S. inventories, cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method.
59527_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
59527_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Equity Investments Investments in businesses in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and holds between a 20% and 50% ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
59527_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company's 50% ownership interest in equity investments includes investments in Turkey and Chile.
59527_16_ITEM15_P38_S2	The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of 50% or less owned equity investments was $19,072 at December 31, 2015 and $18,542 at December 31, 2014 .
59527_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment.
59527_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Depreciation and amortization are computed using a straight-line method over useful lives ranging from three to 20 years for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to 40 years for buildings.
59527_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur.
59527_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.
59527_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
59527_16_ITEM15_P42_S1	Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable.
59527_16_ITEM15_P42_S2	Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
59527_16_ITEM15_P42_S3	If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life.
59527_16_ITEM15_P42_S4	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_16_ITEM15_P42_S5	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company that incorporate allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities, such as the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets and derivative contracts, are valued at fair value using the market and income valuation approaches.
59527_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
59527_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	The Company uses the market approach to value similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the income approach that consists of discounted cash flow models that take into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date.
59527_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
59527_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
59527_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
59527_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	If the asset or liability has a specific (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
59527_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
59527_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company accrues for product warranty claims based on historical experience and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty service.
59527_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	Warranty services are generally provided for periods up to three years from the date of sale.
59527_16_ITEM15_P54_S2	The accrual for product warranty claims is included in Accrued expenses.
59527_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs at point of shipment.
59527_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of Sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including warehousing and freight related to product shipments, are included in Cost of goods sold.
59527_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	Common stock issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options is excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the calculation of option equivalent shares is anti-dilutive.
59527_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, commodity prices and currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain purchase and sales transactions, balance sheet and net investment exposures.
59527_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	Derivative contracts to hedge currency and commodity exposures are generally written on a short-term basis but may cover exposures for up to two years while interest rate contracts may cover longer periods consistent with the terms of the underlying debt.
59527_16_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
59527_16_ITEM15_P59_S3	All derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
59527_16_ITEM15_P59_S4	The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
59527_16_ITEM15_P59_S5	The Company formally documents the relationship of the hedge with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy for all designated hedges.
59527_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable.
59527_16_ITEM15_P60_S1	If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued.
59527_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	The cash flows from settled derivative contracts are recognized in operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments.
59527_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions.
59527_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	The Company manages individual counterparty exposure by monitoring the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the counterparty.
59527_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows).
59527_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The effective portion of the fair value unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_16_ITEM15_P62_S2	At settlement, the realized gain or loss is recorded in Cost of goods sold or Sales for hedges of purchases and sales, respectively, in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
59527_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The ineffective portion on cash flow hedges is recognized in current earnings.
59527_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Net investment hedges For derivative instruments that qualify as a net investment hedge (i.e., hedging the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation), the effective portion of the fair value gains or losses are recognized in AOCI with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	The gains or losses are subsequently reclassified to Selling, general, and administrative expenses, as the underlying hedged investment is liquidated.
59527_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Company has certain derivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity price contracts.
59527_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Foreign exchange forward contracts are held as economic hedges of certain balance sheet exposures and qualify as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability).
59527_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The gains or losses on t hese contracts are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
59527_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	Short-term commodity price contracts are not designated as hedges.
59527_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in Costs of goods sold.
59527_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	Research and Development Research and development costs are charged to Selling, general administrative expenses as incurred and totaled $47,182 , $43,256 and $42,126 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
59527_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Bonus Included in Selling, general administrative expenses are the costs related to the Company's discretionary employee bonus programs, which for certain U.S.-based employees are net of hospitalization costs.
59527_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Bonus costs were $98,651 in 2015 , $128,478 in 2014 and $123,571 in 2013 .
59527_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
59527_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
59527_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to current year classifications.

59527_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	To achieve that core principle, the amendment provides five steps that an entity should apply when recognizing revenue.
59527_16_ITEM15_P80_S2	The amendment also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers.
59527_16_ITEM15_P80_S3	An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application.
59527_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date," which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
59527_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
59527_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements.

59527_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_16_ITEM15_P197_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	The claimants in the asbestos cases seek compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts.
59527_16_ITEM15_P198_S1	The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and intends to contest such suits vigorously.
59527_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs, after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_16_ITEM15_P199_S1	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure would be provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_16_ITEM15_P200_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_16_ITEM15_P200_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_16_ITEM15_P200_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_16_ITEM15_P200_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_16_ITEM15_P200_S5	Based on the Company's historical experience in litigating product liability claims, including a significant number of dismissals, summary judgments and defense verdicts in many cases and immaterial settlement amounts, as well as the Company's current assessment of the underlying merits of the claims and applicable insurance, the Company believes resolution of these claims and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

59527_17_ITEM1_P532_S3	The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 5.
59527_17_ITEM1_P532_S4	The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
59527_17_ITEM1_P533_S0	In connection with the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2016 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer's knowledge: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the Report.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and allocating appropriate resources to address such risks.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S10	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or trade laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P1_S13	An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, our competitors' production costs, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S11	As of December 31, 2016 , we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 5,954 plaintiffs.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P2_S12	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 52,281 of those claims were dismissed, 22 were tried to defense verdicts, seven were tried to plaintiff verdicts (one of which was vacated on appeal), one was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 768 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Even if we are successful defending such claims or product liability coverage is adequate, claims of this nature could cause customers to lose confidence in our products and our company.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P6_S9	Warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may not be able to complete our acquisition or divestiture strategies, successfully integrate acquired businesses and in certain cases we may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Depending on the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our current acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Additionally, from time to time we may identify assets for strategic divestitures that would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets or complete announced divestitures, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the assets on terms and at prices acceptable to us.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Also, as is typical in divestitures, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenues, gross margins and results of operations may suffer.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S9	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S10	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S12	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S13	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S14	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time consuming and costly.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P10_S15	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions and improve our overall competitiveness.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our competitive position could also be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, in certain markets of the world, distributors manufacture and sell arc welding products.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S11	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S12	As a growing global enterprise, the share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P11_S13	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If international economies were to experience significant slowdowns, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations, including:
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Significant fluctuations in relative currency values; in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, as well as the imposition of exchange controls, currency devaluations and hyperinflation.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified managerial and technical (including research and development) personnel.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Any interruption of our workforce, including interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	During the fourth quarter 2016, the Company made amendments to freeze all benefit accruals under the Lincoln Electric Retirement Annuity Program and the domestic Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, effective December 31, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	For further details on the plan freeze and a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected, refer to Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems, which contain confidential information related to our customers, suppliers and employees and other proprietary business information.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We maintain some of these systems and are also dependent on a number of critical corporate infrastructure services provided by third parties relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and finance functions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Furthermore, a security breach could result in unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Any of these could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P22_S8	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We may incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate rationalization actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The Company did not implement any new rationalization plans in 2016.
59527_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For more information regarding prior period rationalization plans, refer to the rationalization and asset impairment related disclosure under Note 6 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

59527_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's cash flow from operations can be cyclical.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Operational cash flow is a key driver of liquidity, providing cash and access to capital markets.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	In assessing liquidity, the Company reviews working capital measurements to define areas for improvement.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Management anticipates the Company will be able to satisfy cash requirements for its ongoing businesses for the foreseeable future primarily with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances, borrowings under its existing credit facilities and raising debt in capital markets.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	The Company continues to expand globally and periodically looks at transactions that would involve significant investments.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S4	The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S5	The Company s financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S6	Where possible, the Company utilizes operational cash flows and raises capital in the most efficient market, usually the United States, and then lends funds to the specific subsidiary that requires funding.
59527_17_ITEM7_P40_S7	If additional acquisitions providing appropriate financial benefits become available, additional expenditures may be made.
59527_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table reflects changes in key cash flow measures:
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash and cash equivalents increased 24.7% , or $74,996 , to $379,179 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 , from $304,183 as of December 31, 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	This increase was predominantly due to the cash provided from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of $350,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes (the "2016 Notes") (refer to Note 8 for additional information), offset by cash used in the acquisition of a business, purchases of common shares for treasury and cash dividends paid to shareholders.
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	At December 31, 2016 , $261,547 of Cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $7,455 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 .

59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S6	Anticipated capital expenditures reflect investments for capital maintenance to improve operational effectiveness.
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S7	Management critically evaluates all proposed capital expenditures and expects each project to increase efficiency, reduce costs, promote business growth or improve the overall safety and environmental conditions of the Company's facilities.
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S8	Cash used by financing activities decreased $107,054 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S9	The decrease was predominantly due to higher net payments in 2015 and lower purchases of common shares for treasury in 2016.
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S10	The Company's debt levels increased from $354,625 at December 31, 2015 to $705,593 at December 31, 2016 due to the issuance of the 2016 Notes.
59527_17_ITEM7_P42_S11	Total debt to total invested capital increased to 49.8% at December 31, 2016 from 27.6% at December 31, 2015 .

59527_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	The Company does not expect to contribute to the defined benefit plans in the United States in 2017.
59527_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Canada - Notice of Reassessment In July 2012, the Company received a Notice of Reassessment (the "Reassessments") from the Canada Revenue Agency in respect to its 2004 to 2010 taxation years to disallow the deductibility of inter-company dividends.
59527_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company appealed the Reassessments to the Tax Court of Canada.
59527_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	In September 2014, the Department of Justice Canada consented to a judgment, wholly in the Company's favor.
59527_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	In vacating the reassessment, this tax litigation is concluded.
59527_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	The Company received a partial refund of a cash deposit in December 2014, with substantially all of the remaining cash deposit received in the first quarter of 2015, including interest.
59527_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	(1) Average operating working capital to net sales is defined as the sum of Accounts receivable and Inventories less Trade accounts payable as of period end divided by annualized rolling three months of Net sales.
59527_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Rationalization and Asset Impairments Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's various rationalization plans whose costs were substantially recognized in the prior year.
59527_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	No charges were recorded in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.
59527_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	The Company believes the rationalization actions will positively impact future results of operations and will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital.
59527_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Acquisitions Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's recent acquisitions.
59527_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Debt At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $669,209 and $342,602 , respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment.
59527_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.
59527_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Senior Unsecured Notes On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued senior unsecured notes (the "2015 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000 through a private placement.
59527_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
59527_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	The 2015 Notes, as shown in the table below, have original maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.5% , excluding accretion of original issuance costs, and an initial average tenure of 19 years.
59527_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The 2015 Notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants.
59527_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
59527_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	On October 20, 2016 the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued senior unsecured notes (the "2016 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000 through a private placement.

59527_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	The 2016 Notes, as shown in the table below, have original maturities ranging from 12 to 25 years with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.1% , excluding accretion of original issuance costs, and an initial average tenure of 18 years.
59527_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The 2016 Notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants.
59527_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
59527_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Company's total weighted average effective interest rate and weighted average term, inclusive of the 2015 Notes and 2016 Notes, is 3.3% and 18 years, respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Company has a line of credit totaling $400,000 through the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which was entered into on September 12, 2014 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, transactions with affiliates, a fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio.
59527_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
59527_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Credit Agreement has a five -year term and may be increased, subject to certain conditions, by an additional amount up to $100,000 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The interest rate on borrowings is based on either the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or the prime rate, plus a spread based on the Company s leverage ratio, at the Company s election.
59527_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Short-term Borrowings The Company had short-term borrowings of $1,758 included in Amounts due banks in 2016 and had a balance of $2,822 at December 31, 2015.
59527_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	Amounts due banks the borrowings of subsidiaries at weighted average interest rates of 29.0% and 24.1% at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Return on Invested Capital The Company reviews return on invested capital ("ROIC") in assessing and evaluating the Company's underlying operating performance.
59527_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC.
59527_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital.
59527_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Amounts due banks, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity.
59527_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
59527_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a tabular reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted net income.
59527_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:
59527_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	_ (1) Purchase commitments include contractual obligations for raw materials and services.
59527_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , there were $14,186 of tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and a $25,244 liability for deferred compensation.
59527_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur.
59527_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	Additionally, in connection with prior acquisitions, there were liabilities with fair values as of December 31, 2016 of $8,154 for a contingent consideration arrangement and $15,272 for a forward contract to acquire an additional ownership interest in a majority owned subsidiary.
59527_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	The amount of future cash flows associated with these liabilities will be contingent upon actual results of the acquired entities.
59527_17_ITEM7_P62_S4	See Notes 12 and 14 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
59527_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	On April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan ("Employee Plan"), which replaced the 2006 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended ("EPI Plan").
59527_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The Employee Plan provides for the granting of options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance-based awards up to an additional 5,400,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	In addition, on April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2015 Director Plan"), which replaced the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2006 Director Plan").
59527_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	The 2015 Director Plan provides for the granting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units up to an additional 300,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_17_ITEM7_P63_S4	At December 31, 2016 , there were 4,862,288 common shares available for future grant under all plans.
59527_17_ITEM7_P63_S5	Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 449,415 in 2016 , 411,406 in 2015 and 22,909 in 2014 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	The Company issued common shares from treasury upon all exercises of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_17_ITEM7_P65_S2	Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $10,332 , $7,932 and $8,416 , respectively, with a related tax benefit of $3,955 , $3,037 and $3,222 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P65_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $18,839 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.3 years .
59527_17_ITEM7_P65_S4	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable which would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2016 was $40,803 and $34,666 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P65_S5	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $30,967 , $6,879 and $14,647 respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Product Liability Costs Product liability costs incurred can be volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	The long-term impact of product liability contingencies, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims.
59527_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
59527_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2016 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_17_ITEM7_P71_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The Company accrues its best estimate of the probable costs after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience.
59527_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure would be provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	The Company maintains liabilities for uncertain income tax positions for many jurisdictions.
59527_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Liabilities are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_17_ITEM7_P76_S2	Liabilities can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_17_ITEM7_P76_S3	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for uncertain income tax positions; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_17_ITEM7_P76_S4	See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for further discussion of uncertain income tax positions.
59527_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were gains of $3,741 in 2016 and losses of $6,023 and $22,351 in 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy The Company deconsolidated its subsidiary in Venezuela effective June 30, 2016 and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting.
59527_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	Beginning July 1, 2016, the Company no longer includes the results of the Venezuelan subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	Refer to Note 1 for additional information.
59527_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed indefinitely reinvested.
59527_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	It is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with the remittance of these earnings.
59527_17_ITEM7_P81_S3	Deferred income taxes associated with earnings that are not expected to be indefinitely reinvested were not significant.
59527_17_ITEM7_P81_S4	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $101,655 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	At December 31, 2016 , a valuation allowance of $47,849 was recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	more likely than not that the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit ("Pension") and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plan.
59527_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	In October 2016, the Company amended the Lincoln Electric Retirement Annuity Program ("RAP") and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") to freeze all benefit accruals for participants under the plans effective as of December 31, 2016.
59527_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
59527_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	A substantial portion of the Company's pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the United States.
59527_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The fair value of plan assets is determined at December 31 of each year.
59527_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 6.1% and 6.3% at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_17_ITEM7_P89_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and, for frozen plans, is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	During 2016 , investment returns were 6.6% compared with a return of 0.9% in 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,200 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA or an equivalent quality.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 4.1% at December 31, 2016 and 4.5% at December 31, 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S3	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $800 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S4	The Company's defined benefit plan expense was $13,988 , $162,815 and $12,395 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S5	Pension expense in 2016 includes net curtailment gains of $1,062, 2015 includes $142,738 in settlement charges and 2014 includes $1,773 in settlement charges.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S6	The Company's defined contribution plan expense was $8,361 , $10,082 and $11,088 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S7	Excluding the net curtailment gains in 2016, the Company expects total 2017 expense related to retirement plans to decrease by a range of approximately $6,000 to $8,000.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S8	The decrease is the result of lower amortization of deferred losses related to the defined benefit plan freeze, partially offset by higher defined contribution plan expense because of the new defined contribution plan.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S9	Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S10	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $146,604 as of December 31, 2016 and $154,756 as of December 31, 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S11	The decrease is primarily the result of the amortization of net losses and curtailments in 2016.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S12	The Company made voluntary contributions to its U.S. defined benefit plans of $20,086 , $47,124 and $21,175 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM7_P91_S13	The Company does not expect to contribute to the defined benefit plans in the United States in 2017.
59527_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
59527_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a LIFO basis.
59527_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	LIFO was used for 40% of total inventories at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.
59527_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis.
59527_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	Actual year-end inventory levels and costs may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.
59527_17_ITEM7_P94_S4	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $61,329 at December 31, 2016 and $59,765 at December 31, 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_17_ITEM7_P96_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
59527_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
59527_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	The quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
59527_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Goodwill is tested by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_17_ITEM7_P105_S2	The fair value of goodwill for all of the Company's reporting units exceeded its carrying value by at least 10% as of the testing date during the fourth quarter of 2016.
59527_17_ITEM7_P105_S3	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM7_P105_S4	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs at point of shipment.
59527_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have an impact on the Black-Scholes model.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2016 and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates at December 31, 2016 .
59527_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The derivative, borrowing and investment arrangements in effect at December 31, 2016 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on the Company's current period consolidated financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company's risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the Company hedged certain third-party and inter-company purchases and sales.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The gross notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2016 was $36,385 .
59527_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	At December 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $1,601.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	In addition, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross-border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The gross notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2016 was $261,168 .
59527_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	A hypothetical 10% change in the year-end exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease to Income before income taxes of $19,556 related to these positions.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	However, any loss (or gain) resulting from a hypothetical 10% change would be offset by the associated gain (or loss) on the underlying balance sheet exposure and would ultimately not materially affect the Company s financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	These hedging arrangements have the effect of fixing for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company had no commodity contracts outstanding during 2016 .
59527_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2016 , the Company had various floating interest rate swaps used to convert $100,000 of its outstanding fixed-rate, long-term borrowings into short-term variable interest rates.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The fixed-rate nature of the remaining long-term borrowings limits the Company's exposure to changes in near-term interest rates.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	An increase in interest expense resulting from a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the December 31, 2016 floating rate, would not materially affect the Company s financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P5_S3	A hypothetical 100 basis point increase to effective interest rates would also impact the fair value of interest rate swap.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P5_S4	However, any loss resulting from this hypothetical scenario would be offset by the associated gain on the underlying debt and have no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016 approximated cost due to their short-term duration.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	These financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments.
59527_17_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
59527_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
59527_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the 2013 framework in "Internal Control Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
59527_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the Company's evaluation under such framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016 .
59527_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

59527_17_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P13_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P13_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
59527_17_ITEM15_P13_S4	In our opinion, Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on the COSO criteria.
59527_17_ITEM15_P13_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated February 24, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

59527_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	See notes to these consolidated financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest (the "Company") after elimination of all inter-company accounts, transactions and profits.
59527_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	General Information The Company is a manufacturer of welding, cutting and brazing products.
59527_17_ITEM15_P20_S1	Welding products include arc welding power sources, plasma cutters, wire feeding systems, robotic welding packages, integrated automation systems, fume extraction equipment, consumable electrodes, fluxes and welding accessories and specialty welding consumables and fabrication.

59527_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_17_ITEM15_P21_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_17_ITEM15_P21_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were gains of $3,741 in 2016 and losses of $6,023 and $22,351 in 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
59527_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	Venezuela Deconsolidation Effective June 30, 2016, the Company determined that deteriorating conditions in Venezuela had led the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria for control over its Venezuelan subsidiary.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	The restrictive exchange controls in Venezuela and the lack of access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuela bolivar and the U.S. dollar, and restricted the Venezuela operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	Additionally, other operating restrictions including government controls on pricing, profits, imports and restrictive labor laws significantly impacted the Company s ability to make key operational decisions, including the ability to manage its capital structure, purchasing, product pricing and labor relations.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	Therefore, as of June 30, 2016, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of its subsidiary in Venezuela and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S3	As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $34,348 ( $33,251 after-tax) in the second quarter of 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S4	The pretax charge includes the write-off of the Company s investment in Venezuela, including all inter-company balances and $283 of Cash and cash equivalents.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S5	Additionally, the charge includes foreign currency translation losses and pension losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
59527_17_ITEM15_P25_S6	Beginning July 1, 2016, the Company no longer includes the results of the Venezuelan subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Under the cost method of accounting, if cash were to be received from the Venezuela entity in future periods from the sale of inventory, dividends or royalties, income would be recognized.
59527_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company does not anticipate dividend or royalty payments being made in the foreseeable future and has no outstanding receivables or payables with the Venezuelan entity.
59527_17_ITEM15_P26_S2	The factors that led to the Company s conclusion to deconsolidate at June 30, 2016 continued to exist through December 31, 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P26_S3	The Company expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.
59527_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Subsequent to the deconsolidation under the voting interest consolidation model, the Company determined that the Venezuelan subsidiary is considered to be a variable interest entity ("VIE").
59527_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	As the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Venezuela subsidiary's economic performance, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore would not consolidate the entity under the VIE consolidation model.
59527_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	Additionally, the Company has no remaining financial commitments to the Venezuelan subsidiary and therefore believes the exposure to future losses are not material.
59527_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	Prior to deconsolidation, the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan operation had been reported under highly inflationary accounting rules since January 1, 2010.
59527_17_ITEM15_P28_S2	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan operation had been remeasured into the Company s reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities were reflected in current earnings.
59527_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ( SIMADI ), which allowed for trading based on supply and demand.
59527_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	At September 30, 2015, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SIMADI rate (now known as "DICOM"), as the SIMADI rate most appropriately approximated the rates used to transact business in its Venezuelan operations.
59527_17_ITEM15_P29_S2	At September 30, 2015, the SIMADI rate was 199.4 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a remeasurement charge on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $4,334 .
59527_17_ITEM15_P29_S3	This foreign exchange loss was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015.
59527_17_ITEM15_P29_S4	Additionally, the Company recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of $22,880 within Cost of goods sold, related to the adoption of the SIMADI rate.
59527_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	In January 2014, the exchange rate applicable to the settlement of certain transactions, including payments of dividends and royalties, changed to utilize the Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration ("SICAD") auction-based exchange rate (the "SICAD rate").
59527_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	As of March 31, 2014, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SICAD rate as future remittances for dividend payments could be transacted at the SICAD rate.
59527_17_ITEM15_P30_S2	As of March 31, 2014, the SICAD rate was 10.7 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a remeasurement loss on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $17,665 which was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2014.
59527_17_ITEM15_P30_S3	Additionally, the Company incurred higher Cost of goods sold of $3,468 during the second quarter of 2014 related to the adoption of the SICAD rate.
59527_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
59527_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_17_ITEM15_P31_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_17_ITEM15_P31_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
59527_17_ITEM15_P32_S2	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) basis.
59527_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	LIFO was used for 40% of total inventories at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.
59527_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis.
59527_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	Refer to Note 15 for additional details.
59527_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
59527_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $19,252 and $19,198 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
59527_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Marketable Securities The Company's marketable securities consist of short-term highly liquid investments classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value using quoted market prices for similar assets at the end of the reporting period.
59527_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	The marketable securities are included in Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

59527_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	Equity Investments Investments in businesses in which the Company does not have a controlling interest and holds between a 20% and 50% ownership interest are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
59527_17_ITEM15_P38_S1	The Company's 50% ownership interest in equity investments includes investments in Turkey and Chile.
59527_17_ITEM15_P38_S2	The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of 50% or less owned equity investments was $19,333 at December 31, 2016 and $19,072 at December 31, 2015 .
59527_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment.
59527_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	Depreciation and amortization are computed using a straight-line method over useful lives ranging from three to 20 years for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to 40 years for buildings.
59527_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur.
59527_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.
59527_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with long-term construction in progress.
59527_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Property, plant and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components:
59527_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
59527_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable.
59527_17_ITEM15_P43_S2	Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
59527_17_ITEM15_P43_S3	If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life.
59527_17_ITEM15_P43_S4	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_17_ITEM15_P43_S5	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
59527_17_ITEM15_P44_S1	The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
59527_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	The quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process.
59527_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Goodwill is tested by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.
59527_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value and impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.
59527_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	Refer to Note 4 for additional details.
59527_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_17_ITEM15_P50_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P50_S2	Refer to Notes 4 and 6 for additional details.
59527_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities, such as the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets and derivative contracts, are valued at fair value using the market and income valuation approaches.
59527_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
59527_17_ITEM15_P51_S2	The Company uses the market approach to value similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the income approach that consists of discounted cash flow models that take into account the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date.
59527_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
59527_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
59527_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
59527_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	If the asset or liability has a specific (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
59527_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
59527_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Refer to Notes 11 and 14 for additional details.
59527_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company accrues for product warranty claims based on historical experience and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty service.

59527_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_17_ITEM15_P60_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including warehousing and freight related to product shipments, are included in Cost of goods sold.
59527_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because the recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P62_S2	Common stock issuable upon the exercise of employee stock options is excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the calculation of option equivalent shares is anti-dilutive.
59527_17_ITEM15_P62_S3	Refer to Note 9 for additional details.
59527_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, commodity prices and currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain purchase and sales transactions, balance sheet and net investment exposures.
59527_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	hedge currency and commodity exposures are generally written on a short-term basis but may cover exposures for up to two years while interest rate contracts may cover longer periods consistent with the terms of the underlying debt.
59527_17_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
59527_17_ITEM15_P64_S2	All derivatives are recognized at fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
59527_17_ITEM15_P64_S3	The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.
59527_17_ITEM15_P64_S4	The Company formally documents the relationship of the hedge with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy for all designated hedges.
59527_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness, when applicable.
59527_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued.
59527_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The cash flows from settled derivative contracts are recognized in operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	The Company is subject to the credit risk of the counterparties to derivative instruments.
59527_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	Counterparties include a number of major banks and financial institutions.
59527_17_ITEM15_P66_S3	The Company manages individual counterparty exposure by monitoring the credit rating of the counterparty and the size of financial commitments and exposures between the Company and the counterparty.
59527_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	Cash flow hedges Certain foreign currency forward contracts are qualified and designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows).
59527_17_ITEM15_P67_S1	The effective portion of the fair value unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other assets, Other current liabilities or Other liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_17_ITEM15_P67_S2	At settlement, the realized gain or loss is recorded in Cost of goods sold or sales for hedges of purchases and sales, respectively, in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
59527_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	The ineffective portion on cash flow hedges is recognized in current earnings.
59527_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	Fair value hedges Certain interest rate swap agreements were qualified and designated as fair value hedges.
59527_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	The interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
59527_17_ITEM15_P69_S2	Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.
59527_17_ITEM15_P69_S3	The effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in Other assets or Other liabilities with offsetting amounts recorded as a fair value adjustment to the carrying value of Long-term debt, less current portion.
59527_17_ITEM15_P69_S4	Net investment hedges For derivative instruments that qualify as a net investment hedge (i.e., hedging the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation), the effective portion of the fair value gains or losses are recognized in AOCI with offsetting amounts recorded as Other current assets, Other assets, Other current liabilities or Other liabilities depending on the position and the duration of the contract.
59527_17_ITEM15_P69_S5	The gains or losses are subsequently reclassified to Selling, general and administrative expenses, as the underlying hedged investment is liquidated.
59527_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments The Company has certain derivative instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity price contracts.
59527_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	Foreign exchange forward contracts are held as economic hedges of certain balance sheet exposures and qualify as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability).
59527_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	The gains or losses on t hese contracts are recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses, offsetting the losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
59527_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Short-term commodity price contracts are not designated as hedges.
59527_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in Costs of goods sold.

59527_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
59527_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
59527_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to current year classifications.
59527_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	The following section provides a description of new accounting pronouncements ("Accounting Standard Update" or "ASU") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") that are applicable to the Company.
59527_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	The following ASUs were adopted as of January 1, 2016 and did not have a significant financial impact on the Company's financial statements:
59527_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments , issued September 2015 ASU 2015-16 requires an acquiring entity to: recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined; record the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts; present separately on the face of the statement of operations or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment had been recognized as of the acquisition date.
59527_17_ITEM15_P79_S1	ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share , issued May 2015 ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for these investments.
59527_17_ITEM15_P79_S2	ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , issued February 2015 ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnership and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs and provides scope exceptions.
59527_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted:
59527_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P81_S1	The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.
59527_17_ITEM15_P81_S2	ASU 2016-09 requires prospective recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from stock-based compensation awards vesting and exercises be recognized as a discrete income tax adjustment in the income statement.
59527_17_ITEM15_P81_S3	Previously, these amounts were recognized in Additional paid-in capital.
59527_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	The impact of the tax adjustment will vary depending on the amount and timing of stock options.
59527_17_ITEM15_P82_S1	In addition, ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be prospectively excluded from the assumed future proceeds in the calculation of diluted shares.
59527_17_ITEM15_P82_S2	The Company expects this change to increase the number of diluted shares in subsequent periods, but not have a material impact on diluted earnings per share.
59527_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	ASU 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits from share based compensation awards be reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	Previously, this activity was included in financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P83_S2	The Company has elected to apply this change on a retrospective basis.
59527_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	activities to increase by the amount reported as Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P84_S1	ASU 2016-09 requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes be reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on a retrospective basis.
59527_17_ITEM15_P84_S2	Previously, this activity was included in operating activities.
59527_17_ITEM15_P84_S3	The Company expects the impact of this change to be immaterial to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P84_S4	The Company has elected to continue to estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, as permitted by ASU 2016-09, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur.
59527_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
59527_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	The amendment also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers.
59527_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ," which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
59527_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	To evaluate the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a scoping analysis of revenue streams against the requirements of the standard.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	In addition, the Company is in the process of reviewing customer contracts, as well as identifying and implementing changes to processes and controls to meet the standard s reporting and disclosure requirements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	ASU 2014-09 will accelerate the timing of when certain transactions are recognized as revenue upon adoption of the guidance s control model.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S3	The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S4	The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements of the following ASUs: Standard Description ASU No. 2017-04, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , issued January 2017.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S5	ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S6	Under this ASU, an entity should perform the Step 1 annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S7	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
59527_17_ITEM15_P87_S8	An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary.
59527_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The ASU is effective January 1, 2020, early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied prospectively.
59527_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows(Topic 230): Restricted Cash, issued November 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	ASU 2016-18 requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P89_S2	The ASU is effective January 1, 2018, early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied retrospectively.
59527_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	ASU No. 2016-16 , Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, issued October 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
59527_17_ITEM15_P90_S2	The ASU is effective January 1, 2018, early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings, as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
59527_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, issued August 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	ASU 2016-15 reduces existing diversity in practice by addressing eight specific cash flow issues related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
59527_17_ITEM15_P91_S2	The ASU is effective January 1, 2018, early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied retrospectively (or prospectively as of earliest date practicable).
59527_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , issued February 2016.
59527_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	ASU 2016-02 aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing agreements.
59527_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	Entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.
59527_17_ITEM15_P93_S1	The ASU is effective January 1, 2019, early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied using either a modified retrospective or modified retrospective with practical expedients approach.
59527_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
59527_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , common shares subject to equity-based awards of 774,502 , 522,471 and 260,090 , respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of their exercise would be anti-dilutive.
59527_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	NOTE 3 ACQUISITIONS During May 2016, the Company acquired Vizient Manufacturing Solutions ("Vizient").

59527_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	During 2015, the Company determined that for certain long-lived assets of a business unit, the carrying value of the assets exceeded the fair value resulting in impairment (see Note 6 for additional details).
59527_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	This result was considered a possible indication of goodwill impairment, therefore, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test, using a combination of income and market valuation approaches resulting in a $6,315 non-cash impairment charge to the carrying value of goodwill.
59527_17_ITEM15_P101_S2	The adjustments to goodwill include the tax benefit attributable to the amortization of tax deductible goodwill in excess of goodwill recorded for financial reporting purposes.

59527_17_ITEM15_P179_S1	Total income tax payments, net of refunds, were $72,965 in 2016 , $101,939 in 2015 and $119,102 in 2014 .

59527_17_ITEM15_P220_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_17_ITEM15_P220_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_17_ITEM15_P220_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_17_ITEM15_P220_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.

(the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2017 , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Report"), each of the undersigned officers of the Company certifies, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that, to such officer's knowledge: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as of the dates and for the periods expressed in the Report.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process seeks to identify and address significant risks.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ERM process is a company-wide initiative that is designed with the intent of prioritizing risks and allocating appropriate resources to address such risks.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We use the integrated risk framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations to assess, manage and monitor risks.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Management has identified and prioritized critical risks based on the severity and likelihood of each risk and assigned an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to monitor and mitigate risks, where possible.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and systematically reviews identified critical risks.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	The Audit Committee also reviews major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control them.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our goal is to pro-actively manage risks in a structured approach and in conjunction with the strategic planning process, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	However, these and other risks and uncertainties could cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The risk factors and uncertainties described below, together with information incorporated by reference or otherwise included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S10	General economic and market conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital markets.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S11	Our operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S12	Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher labor costs, trade barriers in the world markets, financial turmoil related to sovereign debt and changes in tax laws or trade laws or other economic factors affecting the countries and industries in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P1_S13	An adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations, collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Economic and supply disruptions associated with events beyond our control, such as war, acts of terror, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes or natural disasters could adversely affect our supply chain and distribution channels or result in loss of sales and customers.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our facilities and operations, and the facilities and operations of our suppliers and customers, could be disrupted by events beyond our control, such as war, political unrest, pandemic, labor disputes or natural disasters.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Any such disruption could cause delays in the production and distribution of our products and the loss of sales and customers.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate the Company for the losses.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Availability of and volatility in energy costs or raw material prices may adversely affect our performance.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to the availability of and price fluctuations in the purchase of energy and commodities used in the manufacture of our products (primarily steel, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, electronic components, electricity and natural gas).
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	The availability and prices for energy costs and raw materials, including steel, nonferrous metals and chemicals, are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute materials, currency exchange rates, anticipated or perceived shortages, government trade practices and regulations and other factors.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Increases in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to pass along to our customers these cost increases in the form of price increases or otherwise reduce our cost of goods sold.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Although most of the raw materials and components used in our products are commercially available from a number of sources and in adequate supply, any disruption in the availability of such raw materials and components, our inability to timely or otherwise obtain substitutes for such items, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers could adversely affect our business.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S9	We are a co-defendant in litigation alleging asbestos induced illness.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Liabilities relating to such litigation could reduce our profitability and impair our financial condition.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S11	As of December 31, 2017 , we were a co-defendant in cases alleging asbestos induced illness involving claims by approximately 3,613 plaintiffs.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P2_S12	In each instance, we are one of a large number of defendants.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The asbestos claimants allege that exposure to asbestos contained in welding consumables caused the plaintiffs to develop adverse pulmonary diseases, including mesothelioma and other lung cancers.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Since January 1, 1995, we have been a co-defendant in asbestos cases that have been resolved as follows: 54,732 of those claims were dismissed, 23 were tried to defense verdicts, 7 were tried to plaintiff verdicts (one of which was appealed by defendants and was remanded to the trial court for a new trial), 1 was resolved by agreement for an immaterial amount and 776 were decided in favor of the Company following summary judgment motions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The long-term impact of the asbestos loss contingency, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and we benefit significantly from cost-sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	While we intend to contest these lawsuits vigorously, and believe we have applicable insurance relating to these claims, there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect our liability for personal injury claims relating to exposure to asbestos, including the future impact of changing cost sharing arrangements or a change in our overall trial experience.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Asbestos use in welding consumables in the U.S. ceased in 1981.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and application of our products and the products of third-party suppliers that we utilize or resell.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our products are used in a variety of applications, including infrastructure projects such as oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges and power generation facilities, the manufacture of transportation and heavy equipment and machinery and various other construction projects.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We face risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that accidents or failures on these projects result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Further, our products are designed for use in specific applications, and if a product is used inappropriately, personal injury or property damage may result.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In certain cases, we design automated welding systems for use in a customer s production facilities (including automotive production facilities), which could expose us to financial losses or professional liability.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The occurrence of defects in or failures of our products, or the misuse of our products in specific applications, could cause termination of customer contracts, increased costs and losses to us, our customers and other end users.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We cannot be assured that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend those claims.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Further, we cannot be assured that our product liability insurance coverage will be adequate for any liabilities that we may ultimately incur or that product liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Even if we are successful defending such claims or product liability coverage is adequate, claims of this nature could cause customers to lose confidence in our products and our company.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The cyclical nature and maturity of the arc welding and cutting industry in developed markets may adversely affect our performance.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and the welding industry has historically experienced contraction during periods of slowing industrial activity.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If economic, business and industry conditions deteriorate, capital spending in those sectors may be substantially decreased, which could reduce demand for our products, our revenues and our results of operations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may not be able to complete our acquisition or divestiture strategies, successfully integrate acquired businesses and in certain cases we may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Part of our business strategy is to pursue targeted business acquisition opportunities, including foreign investment opportunities.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We cannot be certain that we will be successful in pursuing potential acquisition candidates or that the consequences of any acquisition would be beneficial to us.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Future acquisitions may expose us to unexpected liabilities and involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Integration efforts may include significant rationalization activities that could be disruptive to the business.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our current operational cash flow is sufficient to fund our acquisition plans, but a significant acquisition could require access to the capital markets.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Additionally, from time to time we may identify assets for strategic divestitures that would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets or complete announced divestitures, including the receipt of approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the interests or purchase the assets on terms and at prices acceptable to us.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Also, as is typical in divestitures, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result, after a divestiture, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demands, continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenues, gross margins and results of operations may suffer.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to meet our customers' needs for welding and cutting products through the introduction of innovative new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We must remain committed to product research and development and customer service in order to remain competitive.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We cannot be assured that new products or product improvements, once developed, will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to our operating results, or that we will be able to continue our product development efforts at a pace to sustain future growth.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Further, we may lose customers to our competitors if they demonstrate product design, development or manufacturing capabilities superior to ours.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S9	We rely upon patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in foreign countries, as well as agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S10	However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to provide a competitive advantage.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Further, the laws and their application in certain foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Accordingly, in certain countries, we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could impact our competitive position.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Further, third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Even if we believe that those claims are without merit, defending those claims and contesting the validity of patents can be time consuming and costly.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing, marketing or selling certain of our products.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margins and prospects.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We operate in a highly competitive global environment and compete in each of our businesses with other broad-line manufacturers and numerous smaller competitors specializing in particular products.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We compete primarily on the basis of brand, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We have previously initiated, and may in the future initiate significant rationalization activities to align our business to market conditions and improve our overall competitiveness, including with respect to the integration of acquired businesses.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Such rationalization activities could fail to deliver the desired competitive cost structure and could result in disruptions in customer service.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of the criteria listed above, our operations, results and prospects could suffer.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Further, in the past decade, the arc welding industry in the United States and other developed countries has been subject to increased levels of foreign competition as low cost imports have become more readily available.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Our competitive position could be harmed if new or emerging competitors become more active in the arc welding business.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S11	For example, while steel manufacturers traditionally have not been significant competitors in the domestic arc welding industry, some foreign integrated steel producers manufacture selected consumable arc welding products and robotic arm manufacturers compete in the automated welding and cutting space.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S12	In addition, in certain markets of the world, distributors manufacture and sell arc welding products.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Our sales and results of operations, as well as our plans to expand in some foreign countries, could be adversely affected by this practice.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S14	We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and maintain manufacturing facilities in a number of foreign countries, which subjects us to risks associated with doing business outside the United States.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S15	As a growing global enterprise, the share of sales and profits we derive from our international operations and exports from the United States is significant.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P12_S16	This trend increases our exposure to the performance of many developing economies in addition to the developed economies outside of the United States.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If international economies were to experience significant slowdowns, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	There are a number of risks in doing business internationally, which may impede our ability to achieve our strategic objectives relating to our foreign operations, including:
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Significant fluctuations in relative currency values; in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition, as well as the imposition of exchange controls, currency devaluations and hyperinflation.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce, and any interruption in our workforce could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly qualified managerial and technical (including research and development) personnel.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not succeed in identifying, attracting or retaining qualified personnel.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	With our strategy to expand internationally into developing markets, we may incur additional risks as some developing economies lack a sufficiently trained labor pool.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Any interruption of our workforce, including rationalization efforts related to the integration of acquired businesses, interruptions due to unionization efforts, changes in labor relations or shortages of appropriately skilled individuals could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market trends, such as changes in discount rates and actual investment return on pension assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Significant changes in discount rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our benefit obligations and adversely impact our results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows through our annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	During the fourth quarter 2016, the Company made amendments to freeze all benefit accruals under the Lincoln Electric Retirement Annuity Program and the domestic Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, effective December 31, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	For further details on the plan freeze and a discussion regarding how the financial statements have been affected, refer to Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our business is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowances of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The conduct and management of our business relies extensively on information technology systems, which contain confidential information related to our customers, suppliers and employees and other proprietary business information.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We maintain some of these systems and are also dependent on a number of critical corporate infrastructure services provided by third parties relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and finance functions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a significant cyber security breach, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Furthermore, a security breach could result in financial loss, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any of these could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations inside and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We also face increasing complexity in our products design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the design, production and labeling of our products that are sold worldwide in multiple jurisdictions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We may incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate rationalization actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We may take additional actions in the future to further optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but are not be limited to asset impairments, employee severance costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension settlements, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future rationalization plans in full or in part or within the time periods we expect.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	For more information regarding rationalization plans, refer to the rationalization and asset impairment related disclosure under Note 6 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company has 63 manufacturing facilities, including operations and joint ventures in 23 countries, the significant locations (grouped by operating segment) of which are as follows: Americas Welding:
59527_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	Cleveland and Fort Loramie, Ohio; San Diego and Anaheim, California; Reno, Nevada; Ladson, South Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Detroit, Michigan; Fort Collins, Colorado; Bettendorf, Iowa.
59527_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	Shanghai; Nanjing; Zhengzhou; Luan County; Hangzhou.
59527_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	Corsalone; Due Carrere; Ardenno; Verona; Storo.
59527_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	Sheffield and Chertsey, England; Port Talbot, Wales.
59527_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	All properties relating to the Company's Cleveland, Ohio headquarters and manufacturing facilities are owned by the Company.

59527_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's cash flow from operations can be cyclical.
59527_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Operational cash flow is a key driver of liquidity, providing cash and access to capital markets.
59527_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	In assessing liquidity, the Company reviews working capital measurements to define areas for improvement.
59527_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Management anticipates the Company will be able to satisfy cash requirements for its ongoing businesses for the foreseeable future primarily with cash generated by operations, existing cash balances, borrowings under its existing credit facilities and raising debt in capital markets.
59527_18_ITEM7_P47_S3	The Company continues to expand globally and periodically looks at transactions that would involve significant investments.
59527_18_ITEM7_P47_S4	The Company can fund its global expansion plans with operational cash flow, but a significant acquisition may require access to capital markets, in particular, the long-term debt market, as well as the syndicated bank loan market.
59527_18_ITEM7_P47_S5	The Company s financing strategy is to fund itself at the lowest after-tax cost of funding.
59527_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	If additional acquisitions providing appropriate financial benefits become available, additional expenditures may be made.
59527_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The following table reflects changes in key cash flow measures:
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) Cash provided by operating activities increased $22,288 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .

59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	Cash used by investing activities increased $74,594 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 predominantly due to an increase in cash paid for the acquisition of a business and the purchase of marketable securities.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	The Company anticipates capital expenditures of $60,000 to $70,000 in 2018 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S5	Anticipated capital expenditures reflect investments for capital maintenance to improve operational effectiveness.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S6	Management critically evaluates all proposed capital expenditures and expects each project to increase efficiency, reduce costs, promote business growth or improve the overall safety and environmental conditions of the Company's facilities.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S7	(3) Cash used by financing activities increased $63,029 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S8	The increase was due to higher proceeds from long-term borrowings in 2016 partially offset by higher purchases of common shares for treasury in 2016.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S9	Cash used by financing activities decreased in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared with the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 predominantly due to higher net borrowings in 2015 and lower purchases of common shares for treasury in 2016.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S10	(4) Cash and cash equivalents decreased 13.8% , or $52,478 , to $326,701 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 , from $379,179 as of December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S11	This decrease was predominantly due to the purchase of marketable securities.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S12	Cash and cash equivalents increased 24.7% , or $74,996 , to $379,179 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 , from $304,183 as of December 31, 2015 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S13	The increase was predominantly due to cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from borrowings, offset by cash used in the acquisition of a business, purchase of common shares for treasury and cash dividends paid to shareholders.
59527_18_ITEM7_P49_S14	At December 31, 2017 , $272,433 of Cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to U.S. income taxes, local country taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the U.S.

59527_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	(1) Average operating working capital to net sales is defined as the sum of Accounts receivable and Inventories less Trade accounts payable as of period end divided by annualized rolling three months of Net sales.
59527_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Rationalization and Asset Impairments Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's rationalization plans.
59527_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Company believes the rationalization actions will positively impact future results of operations and will not have a material effect on liquidity and sources and uses of capital.
59527_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Acquisitions Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's recent acquisitions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Debt At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $687,428 and $669,209 , respectively, which was determined using available market information and methodologies requiring judgment.
59527_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Since judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the debt is not necessarily the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.
59527_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Senior Unsecured Notes On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued senior unsecured notes (the "2015 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000 through a private placement.

59527_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The 2015 Notes have original maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.5% , excluding accretion of original issuance costs, and an initial average tenure of 19 years.
59527_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The 2015 Notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants.
59527_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
59527_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	On October 20, 2016 the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued senior unsecured notes (the "2016 Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $ 350,000 through a private placement.
59527_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes.
59527_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	The 2016 Notes have original maturities ranging from 12 to 25 years with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.1% , excluding accretion of original issuance costs, and an initial average tenure of 18 years.
59527_18_ITEM7_P56_S3	The 2016 Notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants.
59527_18_ITEM7_P56_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
59527_18_ITEM7_P56_S5	The Company's total weighted average effective interest rate and weighted average term, inclusive of the 2015 Notes and 2016 Notes, is 3.3% and 18 years, respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company has a line of credit totaling $400,000 through the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ).
59527_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Credit Agreement has a five -year term and may be increased, subject to certain conditions, by an additional amount up to $100,000 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	The interest rate on borrowings is based on either the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or the prime rate, plus a spread based on the Company s leverage ratio, at the Company s election.
59527_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company amended and restated the Credit Agreement on June 30, 2017 , extending the maturity of the line of credit to June 30, 2022 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, transactions with affiliates, a fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio.
59527_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.
59527_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	Short-term Borrowings The Company had short-term borrowings included in Amounts due banks of $ 2,020 and $1,758 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.

59527_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Return on Invested Capital The Company reviews return on invested capital ("ROIC") in assessing and evaluating the Company's underlying operating performance.
59527_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC.
59527_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	ROIC is defined as rolling 12 months of Adjusted net income excluding tax-effected interest income and expense divided by invested capital.
59527_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Invested capital is defined as total debt, which includes Amounts due banks, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt, less current portions, plus Total equity.
59527_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	ROIC for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were as follows:
59527_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a tabular reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted net income.
59527_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The Company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:

59527_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, the Company is unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur.
59527_18_ITEM7_P66_S4	Additionally, in connection with prior acquisitions, there were liabilities with total fair values as of December 31, 2017 of $7,086 for contingent consideration arrangements.
59527_18_ITEM7_P66_S5	The amount of future cash flows associated with these liabilities will be contingent upon actual results of the acquired entities.
59527_18_ITEM7_P66_S6	Refer to Notes 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
59527_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	On April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan ("Employee Plan"), which replaced the 2006 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended ("EPI Plan").
59527_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Employee Plan provides for the granting of options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and performance-based awards up to an additional 5,400,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, on April 23, 2015, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2015 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2015 Director Plan"), which replaced the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("2006 Director Plan").
59527_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	The 2015 Director Plan provides for the granting of options, restricted shares and restricted stock units up to an additional 300,000 of the Company's common shares.
59527_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	At December 31, 2017 , there were 4,324,951 common shares available for future grant under all plans.
59527_18_ITEM7_P67_S5	Under these plans, options, restricted shares and restricted stock units granted were 341,770 in 2017 , 449,415 in 2016 and 411,406 in 2015 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	The Company issued common shares from treasury upon all exercises of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and the granting of restricted stock awards in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Expense is recognized for all awards of stock-based compensation by allocating the aggregate grant date fair value over the vesting period.
59527_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	No expense is recognized for any stock options, restricted or deferred shares or restricted stock units ultimately forfeited because recipients fail to meet vesting requirements.
59527_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $12,698 , $10,332 and $7,932 , respectively, with a related tax benefit of $4,861 , $3,955 and $3,037 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted shares and restricted stock units was $20,022 , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years years.
59527_18_ITEM7_P69_S4	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable which would have been received by the optionees had all awards been exercised at December 31, 2017 was $45,139 and $37,169 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P69_S5	The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $19,328 , $30,967 and $6,879 respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Product Liability Costs Product liability costs incurred can be volatile and are largely related to trial activity.
59527_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	The long-term impact of product liability contingencies, in the aggregate, on operating results, operating cash flows and access to capital markets is difficult to assess, particularly since claims are in many different stages of development and the Company benefits significantly from cost sharing with co-defendants and insurance carriers.
59527_18_ITEM7_P70_S3	Moreover, the Company has been largely successful to date in its defense of these claims.
59527_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Company utilizes letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations.
59527_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreement.
59527_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
59527_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically by management and compared to historical trends to determine the accuracy of estimates and assumptions used.
59527_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	If warranted, these estimates and assumptions may be changed as current trends are assessed and updated.
59527_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Historically, the Company's estimates have been determined to be reasonable.
59527_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	No material changes to the Company's accounting policies were made during 2017 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	The Company believes the following accounting policies are some of the more critical judgment areas affecting its financial condition and results of operations.
59527_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Legal and Tax Contingencies The Company, like other manufacturers, is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
59527_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Such claims and litigation include, without limitation, product liability claims, administrative claims, regulatory claims and health, safety and environmental claims, some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos induced illnesses.
59527_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	The costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs, which are recognized in the periods incurred.
59527_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	Insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and, where reimbursements are probable, they are recognized in the applicable period.
59527_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	With respect to costs other than defense costs (i.e., for liability and/or settlement or other resolution), reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome.
59527_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	If an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable, or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, disclosure would be provided for material claims or litigation.
59527_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Many of the current cases are in differing procedural stages and information on the circumstances of each claimant, which forms the basis for judgments as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions, varies greatly.
59527_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Therefore, in many situations a range of possible losses cannot be made.
59527_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	Reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change.
59527_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	Moreover, reserves only cover identified and/or asserted claims.
59527_18_ITEM7_P78_S4	Future claims could, therefore, give rise to increases to such reserves.
59527_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The Company is subject to taxation from U.S. federal, state, municipal and international jurisdictions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	The calculation of current income tax expense is based on the best information available and involves significant management judgment.
59527_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can in some instances be ultimately determined several years after the financial statements are published.
59527_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	In accordance with SAB 118, the Company's financial results reflect provisional amounts for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act for which accounting analysis under ASC 740 is ongoing.
59527_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The amounts recorded are based on reasonable estimates and may require further adjustments as additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury is provided, the Company's assumptions change or as further information and interpretations become available.
59527_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	The Company maintains liabilities for uncertain income tax positions for many jurisdictions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	Liabilities are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation.
59527_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Liabilities can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate.
59527_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for uncertain income tax positions; however, actual results may materially differ from these estimates.
59527_18_ITEM7_P82_S4	Refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of uncertain income tax positions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were gains of $5,654 and $3,741 in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and a loss of $6,023 in 2015 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Venezuela Highly Inflationary Economy The Company deconsolidated its subsidiary in Venezuela effective June 30, 2016 and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting.
59527_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Beginning July 1, 2016, the Company no longer includes the results of the Venezuelan subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the GAAP and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	During December 2017, the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of passage of the U.S Tax Act.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	The provisional amount recorded for the remeasurement is a tax benefit of $14,532.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	The Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the U.S. Tax Act and refining calculations that could potentially affect the measurement of deferred income tax balances, including law changes surrounding deferred compensation.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S4	The Company previously considered the earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S5	As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, the Company determined it will repatriate earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are subject to foreign withholding taxes.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S6	The Company has estimated the associated tax to be $6,667.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S7	The Company considers remaining earnings in all other non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and has not recorded any deferred taxes as such estimate is not practicable.
59527_18_ITEM7_P87_S8	At December 31, 2017 , the Company had approximately $118,412 of gross deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carry-forwards which may reduce taxable income in future years.
59527_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
59527_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
59527_18_ITEM7_P88_S2	At December 31, 2017 , a valuation allowance of $68,694 was recorded against certain deferred tax assets based on this assessment.
59527_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized.
59527_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the Company's assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes.
59527_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Pensions The Company maintains a number of defined benefit ("Pension") and defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits for employees.
59527_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	These plans are maintained and contributions are made in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), local statutory law or as determined by the Board of Directors.
59527_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	The plans generally provide benefits based upon years of service and compensation.
59527_18_ITEM7_P90_S3	Pension plans are funded except for a domestic non-qualified pension plan for certain key employees and certain foreign plans.
59527_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	In October 2016, the Company amended the Lincoln Electric Retirement Annuity Program ("RAP") and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") to freeze all benefit accruals for participants under the plans effective as of December 31, 2016 and November 30, 2016, respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
59527_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	A significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the expected return on plan assets.
59527_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	At the end of each year, the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the weighted average expected return of the various asset classes in the plan's portfolio and the targeted allocation of plan assets.
59527_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	The asset class return is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and equity market performance.
59527_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	The Company determined this rate to be 5.8% and 6.1% at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	The assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets.
59527_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	This produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense.
59527_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	The difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and, for frozen plans, is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants expected to receive benefits under the plan.
59527_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	During 2017 , investment returns were 14.8% compared with a return of 6.6% in 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	A 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $1,300 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Another significant element in determining the Company's pension expense is the discount rate for plan liabilities.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S1	To develop the discount rate assumption, the Company refers to the yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available non-callable bonds rated AA or an equivalent quality.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S2	The Company determined this rate to be 4.1% at December 31, 2017 and 4.3% at December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S3	A 10 basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately $100 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S4	The Company's defined benefit plan expense was $2,517 , $13,988 and $162,815 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S5	Pension expense includes $8,252 and $142,738 in settlement charges in 2017 and 2015, respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S6	The Company's defined contribution plan expense was $25,285 , $8,361 and $10,082 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S7	Excluding the pension settlement charges in 2017, the Company expects total 2018 expense related to retirement plans to increase by a range of approximately $2,000 to $3,000.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S8	The increase is the result of lower expected return on assets.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S9	Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S10	The Accumulated other comprehensive loss, excluding tax effects, recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $116,690 as of December 31, 2017 and $146,604 as of December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S11	The increase is primarily the result of the amortization of net losses and settlements in 2017.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S12	The Company made contributions to its defined benefit plans of $1,739 , $21,373 and $50,468 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P95_S13	The Company does not expect to make significant contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2018.
59527_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
59527_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a LIFO basis.
59527_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	LIFO was used for 32% and 40% of total inventories at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis.
59527_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	The valuation of LIFO inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time.
59527_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.
59527_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	Actual year-end inventory levels and costs may differ from interim LIFO inventory valuations.
59527_18_ITEM7_P98_S4	The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was $68,641 at December 31, 2017 and $61,329 at December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Company reviews the net realizable value of inventory on an on-going basis with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors.
59527_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, and the Company's estimates prove to be inaccurate, write-downs of inventory values and adjustments to Cost of goods sold may be required.
59527_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Accounts Receivable The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	The fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
59527_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
59527_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	No. 2017-04, " Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.".
59527_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	As such, the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is now a one-step process.
59527_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company compared the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount.
59527_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
59527_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	As a result of 2017 testing, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,091 to the carrying value of goodwill for one reporting unit.
59527_18_ITEM7_P110_S3	The fair value of goodwill for all other reporting units exceeded its carrying value by at least 10%.
59527_18_ITEM7_P110_S4	Key assumptions in estimating the reporting unit's fair value include assumed market participant assumptions of revenue growth, operating margins and the rate used to discount future cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM7_P110_S5	Actual revenue growth and operating margins below the assumed market participant assumptions or an increase in the discount rate would have a negative impact on the fair value of the reporting unit that could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
59527_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	Acquisitions Upon acquisition of a business, the Company uses the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the valuation as appropriate.
59527_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	The valuation inputs in these models and analyses are based on market participant assumptions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	Market participants are considered to be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
59527_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	Fair value estimates are based on a series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	Management values properties using the cost approach supported where available by observable market data, which includes consideration of obsolescence.
59527_18_ITEM7_P114_S1	Management values acquired intangible assets using the relief from royalty method, a form of the income approach supported by observable market data for peer companies.
59527_18_ITEM7_P114_S2	Acquired inventories are marked to fair value.
59527_18_ITEM7_P114_S3	For certain items, the carrying value is determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on information available to the Company.
59527_18_ITEM7_P114_S4	Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
59527_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	Revenue Recognition Substantially all of the Company's revenues are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs at point of shipment.
59527_18_ITEM7_P115_S1	The Company recognizes any discounts, credits, returns, rebates and incentive programs based on reasonable estimates as a reduction of sales to arrive at Net sales at the same time the related revenue is recorded.
59527_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	For contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete.
59527_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	The cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change, including anticipated losses.
59527_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
59527_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Black-Scholes model requires assumptions regarding the volatility of the Company's common shares, the expected life of the stock award and the Company's dividend yield.
59527_18_ITEM7_P117_S2	The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
59527_18_ITEM7_P117_S3	An increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management's control could have an impact on the Black-Scholes model.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Included below is a sensitivity analysis based upon a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2017 and a 100 basis point increase in effective interest rates at December 31, 2017 .
59527_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The derivative, borrowing and investment arrangements in effect at December 31, 2017 were compared to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on the Company's current period consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting the Company's risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	At December 31, 2017 , the Company hedged certain third-party and intercompany purchases and sales.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The gross notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2017 was $35,489 .
59527_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	At December 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the U.S. dollar would have changed Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $1,341 .
59527_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	In addition, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross-border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The gross notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2017 was $340,884 .
59527_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A hypothetical 10% change in the year-end exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease to Income before income taxes of $9,983 related to these positions.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	However, any loss (or gain) resulting from a hypothetical 10% change would be offset by the associated gain (or loss) on the underlying balance sheet exposure and would ultimately not materially affect the Company s financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Commodity Price Risk From time to time, the Company uses various hedging arrangements to manage exposures to price risk from commodity purchases.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	These hedging arrangements have the effect of fixing for specified periods the prices the Company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company had no commodity contracts outstanding during 2017 .
59527_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2017 , the Company had various floating interest rate swaps used to convert $100,000 of its outstanding fixed-rate, long-term borrowings into short-term variable interest rates.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The fixed-rate nature of the remaining long-term borrowings limits the Company's exposure to changes in near-term interest rates.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	An increase in interest expense resulting from a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the December 31, 2017 floating rate, would not materially affect the Company s financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P5_S4	A hypothetical 100 basis point increase to effective interest rates would also impact the fair value of interest rate swap.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P5_S5	However, any loss resulting from this hypothetical scenario would be offset by the associated gain on the underlying debt and have no impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 approximated cost due to the short-term duration.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	These financial instruments are subject to concentrations of credit risk.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company has minimized this risk by entering into investments with a number of major banks and financial institutions and investing in high-quality instruments.
59527_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company does not expect any counter-parties to fail to meet their obligations.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on the 2013 framework in "Internal Control Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Based on the Company's evaluation under such framework, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 .
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Air Liquide Welding.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	The results of operations are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and constituted 14% of total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 7% of revenues for the year then ended.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S5	As permitted by guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has elected to exclude Air Liquide Welding from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S6	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In July 2017, the Company acquired Air Liquide Welding.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S7	The acquired business operated under its own set of systems and internal controls and the Company is currently maintaining those systems and much of that control environment until it is able to incorporate its processes into the Company's own systems and control environment.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S8	The Company expects to complete the incorporation of the acquired business' operations into the Company's systems and control environment in fiscal year 2018.
59527_18_ITEM9A_P1_S9	Except for changes in connection with the Company's acquisition of the Air Liquide Welding business noted above, there have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
59527_18_ITEM10_P0_S0	Except for the information set forth within Part I, Item 1C section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K concerning our Executive Officers, the information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the 2018 proxy statement.
59527_18_ITEM12_P0_S0	For further information on the Company's equity compensation plans, see Note 1 and Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P0_S0	The following consolidated financial statement schedule of the Company is included in a separate section of this report following the signature page: Schedule II Valuation and Qualifying Accounts All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not required under the related instructions or are inapplicable, and therefore, have been omitted.

59527_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.
59527_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index as Item 15 (a) (2) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").
59527_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_18_ITEM15_P26_S2	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations or the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	Basis for Opinion These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S5	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S6	Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S7	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S8	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_18_ITEM15_P27_S9	We have served as the Company's auditor since at least 1923, but we are unable to determine the specific year.
59527_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.
59527_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	We have audited Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

59527_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Air Liquide Welding, which is included in the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 14% of total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 7% of revenues for the year then ended.
59527_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Air Liquide Welding.
59527_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 , and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index as Item 15(a)(2), and our report dated February 27, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
59527_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
59527_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
59527_18_ITEM15_P32_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
59527_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
59527_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
59527_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
59527_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
59527_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
59527_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P36_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
59527_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	See notes to these consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	See notes to these consolidated financial statements.

59527_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	See notes to these consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	See notes to these consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest (the "Company") after elimination of all inter-company accounts, transactions and profits.
59527_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	General Information The Company is a manufacturer of welding, cutting and brazing products.
59527_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	Welding products include arc welding power sources, plasma cutters, wire feeding systems, robotic welding packages, integrated automation systems, fume extraction equipment, consumable electrodes, fluxes and welding accessories and specialty welding consumables and fabrication.
59527_18_ITEM15_P43_S2	The Company's product offering also includes computer numeric controlled ("CNC") plasma and oxy-fuel cutting systems and regulators and torches used in oxy-fuel welding, cutting and brazing.
59527_18_ITEM15_P43_S3	In addition, the Company has a leading global position in the brazing and soldering alloys market.
59527_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	Translation of Foreign Currencies Asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the dates of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates.
59527_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of Total equity.
59527_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, both historical and current exchange rates are used in translating balance sheet accounts and translation adjustments are included in Net income.
59527_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	The translation of assets and liabilities originally denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is for consolidation purposes, and does not necessarily indicate that the Company could realize or settle the reported value of those assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars.
59527_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Additionally, such a translation does not necessarily indicate that the Company could return or distribute the reported U.S. dollar value of the net equity of its foreign operations to shareholders.
59527_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Selling, general administrative expenses and were gains of $5,654 and $3,741 in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and a loss of $6,023 in 2015 .
59527_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	Venezuela Deconsolidation Effective June 30, 2016, the Company determined that deteriorating conditions in Venezuela had led the Company to no longer meet the accounting criteria for control over its Venezuelan subsidiary.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	The restrictive exchange controls in Venezuela and the lack of access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange mechanisms resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuela bolivar and the U.S. dollar, and restricted the Venezuela operations ability to pay dividends and satisfy other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	Additionally, other operating restrictions including government controls on pricing, profits, imports and restrictive labor laws significantly impacted the Company s ability to make key operational decisions, including the ability to manage its capital structure, purchasing, product pricing and labor relations.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S2	Therefore, as of June 30, 2016, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of its subsidiary in Venezuela and began reporting the results under the cost method of accounting.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S3	As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $34,348 ( $33,251 after-tax) in the second quarter of 2016.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S4	The pretax charge includes the write-off of the Company s investment in Venezuela, including all inter-company balances and $283 of Cash and cash equivalents.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S5	Additionally, the charge includes foreign currency translation losses and pension losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
59527_18_ITEM15_P48_S6	Beginning July 1, 2016, the Company no longer includes the results of the Venezuelan subsidiary in its consolidated financial statements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Under the cost method of accounting, if cash were to be received from the Venezuela entity in future periods from the sale of inventory, dividends or royalties, income would be recognized.
59527_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company does not anticipate dividend or royalty payments being made in the foreseeable future and has no outstanding receivables or payables with the Venezuelan entity.
59527_18_ITEM15_P49_S2	The factors that led to the Company s conclusion to deconsolidate at June 30, 2016 continued to exist through December 31, 2017.
59527_18_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.
59527_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Subsequent to the deconsolidation under the voting interest consolidation model, the Company determined that the Venezuelan subsidiary is considered to be a variable interest entity ("VIE").
59527_18_ITEM15_P50_S1	As the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Venezuela subsidiary's economic performance, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore would not consolidate the entity under the VIE consolidation model.
59527_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	Additionally, the Company has no remaining financial commitments to the Venezuelan subsidiary and therefore believes the exposure to future losses are not material.
59527_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	Prior to deconsolidation, the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan operation had been reported under highly inflationary accounting rules since January 1, 2010.
59527_18_ITEM15_P51_S2	Under highly inflationary accounting, the financial statements of the Company s Venezuelan operation had been remeasured into the Company s reporting currency and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities were reflected in current earnings.
59527_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	In February 2015, the Venezuelan government announced a new exchange market called the Marginal Currency System ( SIMADI ), which allowed for trading based on supply and demand.
59527_18_ITEM15_P52_S1	At September 30, 2015, the Company determined that the rate used in remeasuring the Venezuelan operation's financial statements into U.S. dollars would change to the SIMADI rate (now known as "DICOM"), as the SIMADI rate most appropriately approximated the rates used to transact business in its Venezuelan operations.
59527_18_ITEM15_P52_S2	At September 30, 2015, the SIMADI rate was 199.4 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a remeasurement charge on the bolivar-denominated monetary net asset position of $4,334 .
59527_18_ITEM15_P52_S3	This foreign exchange loss was recorded in Selling, general administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015.
59527_18_ITEM15_P52_S4	Additionally, the Company recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of $22,880 within Cost of goods sold, related to the adoption of the SIMADI rate.
59527_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
59527_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered.
59527_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	The Company estimates this allowance based on the age of the related receivable, knowledge of the financial condition of customers, review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information.
59527_18_ITEM15_P53_S3	If the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future, additional allowances may be required.
59527_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	Historically, the Company's reserves have approximated actual experience.
59527_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	Marketable Securities The Company's marketable securities consist of short-term highly liquid investments classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value using quoted market prices for similar assets at the end of the reporting period.
59527_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
59527_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	Fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to inventory based on normal production capacity and abnormal manufacturing costs are recognized as period costs.
59527_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	Cost for a substantial portion of U.S. inventories is determined on a last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) basis.
59527_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , approximately 32% and 40% of total inventories, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method.
59527_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Cost of other inventories is determined by costing methods that approximate a first-in, first-out ( FIFO ) basis.
59527_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	Refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
59527_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	Reserves are maintained for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
59527_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $27,544 and $19,252 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
59527_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Prepaid Expenses Prepaid expenses include prepaid insurance, prepaid rent, prepaid service contracts and other prepaid items.
59527_18_ITEM15_P60_S1	Prepaid expenses are included in Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $15,599 at December 31, 2017 and $12,139 at December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	Equity Investments Investments in businesses which the Company does not own a majority interest and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method.
59527_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company's 50% ownership interest in equity investments includes investments in Turkey and Chile.
59527_18_ITEM15_P61_S2	The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of 50% or less owned equity investments was $19,670 at December 31, 2017 and $19,333 at December 31, 2016 .
59527_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and include improvements which significantly increase capacities or extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment.
59527_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	Depreciation and amortization are computed using a straight-line method over useful lives ranging from three to 20 years for machinery, tools and equipment, and up to 40 years for buildings.
59527_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	Net gains or losses related to asset dispositions are recognized in earnings in the period in which dispositions occur.
59527_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	Routine maintenance, repairs and replacements are expensed as incurred.
59527_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with long-term construction in progress.
59527_18_ITEM15_P65_S1	Property, plant and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is comprised of the following components:
59527_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	Goodwill and Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
59527_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at fair value at the time acquired or at cost, if applicable.
59527_18_ITEM15_P66_S2	Intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
59527_18_ITEM15_P66_S3	If the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, the intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the legal or estimated life.
59527_18_ITEM15_P66_S4	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter using the same dates each year or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment.
59527_18_ITEM15_P66_S5	In performing the annual impairment test, the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
59527_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	For goodwill, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
59527_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	The quantitative test is required only if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
59527_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	No. 2017-04, " Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.".
59527_18_ITEM15_P68_S1	As such, the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is now a one-step process.
59527_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company compared the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount.
59527_18_ITEM15_P69_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
59527_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	Fair values are determined using established business valuation techniques and models developed by the Company, estimates of market participant assumptions of future cash flows, future growth rates and the applicable discount rates to value estimated cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in asset impairments in future periods.
59527_18_ITEM15_P70_S2	Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
59527_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
59527_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists.
59527_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	If an asset is determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value.
59527_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	Fair value is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available.
59527_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM15_P73_S2	Refer to Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
59527_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	Fair Value Measurements Financial assets and liabilities, such as the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets and derivative contracts, are valued at fair value using the market and income valuation approaches.
59527_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
59527_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
59527_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology include:
59527_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
59527_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	If the asset or liability has a specific (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
59527_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
59527_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	Refer to Notes 11 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
59527_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	The Company accrues for product warranty claims based on historical experience and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty service.
59527_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	Warranty services are generally provided for periods up to three years from the date of sale.

59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	ASU 2016-09 amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S2	The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S3	ASU 2016-09 requires prospective recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from stock-based compensation award vesting and exercises as a discrete income tax adjustment in the income statement.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S4	Previously, these amounts were recognized in Additional paid-in capital.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S5	Net excess tax benefits of $6,276 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S6	Earnings per share increased by $0.09 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 , respectively, as a result of this change.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S7	In addition, ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be prospectively excluded from the assumed future proceeds in the calculation of diluted shares.
59527_18_ITEM15_P104_S8	This change results in an insignificant increase in diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 .
59527_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	ASU 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards be reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	Previously, this activity was included in financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
59527_18_ITEM15_P105_S2	The Company has elected to apply this change on a retrospective basis.
59527_18_ITEM15_P105_S3	As a result, excess tax benefits of $6,276 are reported as Net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $9,154 of excess tax benefits were reclassified from Net cash used by financing activities to Net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .

59527_18_ITEM15_P106_S3	The Company has elected to continue to estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, as permitted by ASU 2016-09, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur.
59527_18_ITEM15_P106_S4	ASU 2017-09 provides updated guidance about which changes to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting.
59527_18_ITEM15_P106_S5	Under this ASU, an entity should account for the effects of an award modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions and equity or liability classification of the modified award are the same as the original award.
59527_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	The Company elected early adoption and ASU 2017-09 is effective for the Company as of October 1, 2017.
59527_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test.
59527_18_ITEM15_P107_S2	Under this ASU, an entity should perform the first step in the annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
59527_18_ITEM15_P107_S3	If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
59527_18_ITEM15_P107_S4	An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary.
59527_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	The ASU is effective January 1, 2020, early adoption is permitted and the ASU should be applied prospectively.
59527_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	The Company elected early adoption and ASU 2017-09 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2017.

59527_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
59527_18_ITEM15_P109_S1	The standard also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers.
59527_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ," which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
59527_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	An entity can either adopt this amendment retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application.
59527_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	To evaluate the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a scoping analysis of revenue streams against the requirements of the standard.
59527_18_ITEM15_P111_S1	In addition, the Company completed a review of customer contracts and implemented changes to processes and controls to meet the standard s reporting and disclosure requirements.
59527_18_ITEM15_P111_S2	Upon adoption of the guidance s control model, ASU 2014-09 will change the timing of when revenue is recognized for certain customized products and deliverables.

59527_18_ITEM15_P113_S3	Additionally, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets.
59527_18_ITEM15_P113_S4	The ASU should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost in the income statement and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component.

59527_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	NOTE 3 ACQUISITIONS During July 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Air Liquide Welding, a subsidiary of Air Liquide.
59527_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	The agreed upon purchase price was $135,123 , which was adjusted for certain debt like obligations, for a net purchase price of $61,953 , net of cash acquired.

59527_18_ITEM15_P126_S3	The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.
59527_18_ITEM15_P126_S4	The funding of the cash portion of the purchase price and acquisition costs was provided for with available cash.
