1023313_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those set forth in forward-looking statements made by us.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A Decline in Renewals for Our Membership-Based Research Services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our research products and services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our Business may be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If conditions in the United States and global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our research and advisory services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We have clients in over 60 countries and approximately 28% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients of the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research analysts, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research to meet the changing information needs of our clients.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We compete in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We may also face increased competition from Internet-based research firms.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, information-gathering, and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies, survey-based general market research firms and general business consulting firms.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Trends in technology spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our research services from clients.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The timing of revenue-generating Events sponsored by us.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The hiring and training of new analysts and sales personnel.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Changes in demand for our research and advisory services.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the technologies services industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We May Realize Losses on Our Investments or Be Unable to Liquidate These Investments at Desired Times and in Desired Amounts.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $9.1 million of long-term marketable investments in municipal notes with an auction reset feature.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In February 2008, auctions had begun to fail for these securities and have continued to fail, which means that the parties wishing to sell securities in the normal auction process could not.
1023313_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist.
1023313_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We have not received written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission that remain unresolved.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our headquarters are located in approximately 145,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, substantially all of which is currently occupied by the Company.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates research, marketing, sales, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease term of this facility expires in September 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	On September 29, 2009, we entered into a build-to-suit net lease ( Lease ) with BHX, LLC, as trustee of Acorn Park I Realty Trust and predecessor to 200 Discovery Park, LLC ( Landlord ) pursuant to which the Landlord will build a new corporate headquarters building for the Company in an office park in the Alewife section of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Pursuant to the Lease, as amended, the Landlord will construct an approximately 190,000 square foot building ( Building ) and lease the Building and parcel to us for an initial term of 15 years.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	During construction, we will continue to occupy our current corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts under the existing lease for such premises.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	Presently, we expect to commence using the facility on or about August 15, 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	We also rent office space in Foster City and San Francisco, California, New York City, Dallas, McLean Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	In 2010, we entered into new leases for, and completed the fit-up of and moved into, office space in London and New York.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	The New York lease is for an initial term of ten years for approximately 15,200 square feet.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	The London lease is for a term of eleven years for approximately 17,800 square feet.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P2_S4	We also entered into a new lease for approximately 15,600 feet of office space in San Francisco, with a 63-month term expected to commence during the first half of 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P2_S5	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe and Asia.
1023313_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
1023313_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	regarding an amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Company s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, that relates to a substantive amendment or material departure from a provision of the Code, by posting such information on our Internet website at www.forrester.com .
1023313_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	We also intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market regarding waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our Internet website at www.forrester.com .
1023313_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The remainder of the response to this item is contained in our Proxy Statement for our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the 2011 Proxy Statement ) under the captions Election of Directors and Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance , all of which is incorporated herein by reference.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data presented below is derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read in connection with those statements.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Cash dividends declared in 2010 represents a special dividend of $3.00 per common share declared and paid in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	The 2009 operating income amount includes a $5.4 million reorganization charge for facility consolidations and a reduction-in-force of approximately 50 employees.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	The results of JupiterResearch, LLC, and its parent company, JUPR Holdings, Inc. ( JupiterResearch ) are included in our consolidated results beginning July 31, 2008, the date of acquisition.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	The 2008 other income amount includes a net foreign exchange loss of approximately $1.6 million ($1.2 million after tax) resulting primarily from the remeasurement of certain intercompany payables and receivables.
1023313_11_ITEM6_P5_S1	Of the net $1.6 million loss, approximately $1.9 million related to periods prior to 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	We derive revenues from memberships to our research products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our research.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S6	Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S7	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P0_S8	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Agreement value excludes amounts in excess of the first year value for multiple year contracts signed in 2009 and beyond.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from 2009 to 2010 is primarily due to increased demand for our products and services due to the improvement in the economy and an increase in the number of sales people during 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The increase in agreement value was partially offset by a change in the calculation to exclude agreement value in excess of the first year for multiple year contracts signed in 2009 and beyond, which reduced the growth rate in 2010 by approximately 6% .
1023313_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Client retention and enrichment metrics increased in 2010 which is consistent with an improved economic environment and is also due to increased sales performance in 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The increase in deferred revenue from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to increased demand for our products due to the improvement in the economy in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 2008 as well as the effect of the JupiterResearch and Strategic Oxygen acquisitions completed in July 2008 and December 2009, respectively.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	See Note 2 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The decrease in agreement value from 2008 to 2009 is reflective of the economic downturn in the second half of 2008 through the majority of 2009 which resulted in a lower number of clients and lower enrichment rates in 2009 compared to 2008 and also is due to the exclusion in 2009 of agreement value in excess of the first year value for multiple year contracts signed in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Client and dollar retention amounts were essentially flat in 2009 compared to 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, services have been provided to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research, which include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Teleconferences, and the right to attend one event, are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	Annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We offer our clients a service guarantee, which gives our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Furthermore, our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives and forfeiture rates.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	We are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	In addition, for our performance-vested restricted stock units, we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned and/or the vesting period of the award.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	If our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimate, the actual stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $7.4 million at December 31, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had $76.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2010 and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S5	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P28_S6	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships, technology, research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Investments.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The assessment of the fair value of certain of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these debt instruments.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P39_S3	Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and would be recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we held municipal bonds with a fair value of $9.1 million ($11.0 million at par value) with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The fair value of the ARS was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow approach.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates, based on data available at December 31, 2010, of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change, which may lead us in the future to recorded additional losses for these securities.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	We classified these ARS as available-for-sale securities and determined that the losses were not considered other-than-temporary and were not due to credit losses.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S5	Accordingly, changes in the market value of the ARS have been recorded in other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S6	If the market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record unrealized losses in other comprehensive loss or impairment charges within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P40_S7	We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The increase in total revenues in 2010 is principally the result of increased demand for our products and services and the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009, which accounted for approximately 1.9% of revenue growth.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The effects of foreign exchange resulted in an approximate 1% decrease in total revenues during 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Revenue growth in 2010 was driven by a 12% increase in the technology industry client group (approximately 6.7% due to Strategic Oxygen), a 12% increase in the marketing and strategy client group and a 16% increase for events.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	Revenue in the information technology group was essentially flat for the year.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	Overall revenue growth was due in part to the improvement in the economy and an increase in the number of sales personnel in 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	increase in deferred revenue of approximately 12% at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 and the increase in the number of sales personnel in 2010, we anticipate that revenue growth will accelerate in 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The increase in the dollar amount of cost of services and fulfillment during 2010 is primarily the result of increased compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and an increase in incentive compensation, increased travel-related costs and costs resulting from the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	This increase was partially offset by stock-based compensation expense in 2009 from the accelerated vesting of performance-based stock options.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	We expect facility lease costs to increase by approximately $5.0 million in 2011, of which approximately $2.2 million will be recorded as cost of services and fulfillment in 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	The increase in facility lease costs will primarily result from our move into our new corporate headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the third quarter of 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P44_S4	Of the $5.0 million increase, approximately $3.6 million represents lease costs for the period in 2011 for which we have access to our new Cambridge headquarters for construction purposes until the time that we occupy the facility for operations.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2010 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees and an increase in sales commissions and bonuses.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The increase is also attributable to increased travel-related costs.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Subject to the business environment for our products and services, we have an ongoing initiative to expand our sales force by 15% to 20% annually.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Increased sales of our syndicated research services products attributable to an expanding sales force are generally recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	As noted above under costs of services and fulfillment, we expect facility lease costs to increase by approximately $5.0 million in 2011, of which approximately $2.0 million will be recorded as selling and marketing expense in 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2010 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in the number of general and administrative employees to support our growth plan and an increase in bonuses.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase is also attributable to increased investments in customer facing technology.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	As noted above under costs of services and fulfillment, we expect facility lease costs to increase by approximately $5.0 million in 2011, of which approximately $0.8 million will be recorded as general and administrative expenses in 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The decrease in depreciation expense during 2010 is primarily due to lower amortization of leasehold improvements due to facility consolidations in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	We expect depreciation expense to increase substantially in the second half of 2011 due to our new corporate headquarters and customer facing technologies that will be implemented during 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	The increase in amortization expense during 2010 is primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	We expect amortization expense to decrease by approximately $1.8 million in 2011 as certain intangible assets relating to Strategic Oxygen become fully amortized in the first quarter of 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Reorganization costs in 2009 consist of $3.1 million incurred in the first quarter of 2009 primarily for severance and related benefit costs in connection with the termination of approximately 50 positions and approximately $2.3 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 for costs related to facility consolidations primarily in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The decrease in other income, net during 2010 is primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower returns on invested capital.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Gains (losses) on investments primarily represent our share of our equity method investment gains and losses from our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in gains during 2010 is primarily due to increased valuations of certain assets within the funds in 2010 as compared to net decreases in valuations during 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2010 is primarily due to a non-cash foreign exchange rate gain on the remeasurement of a euro-denominated deferred tax liability in 2010 as compared to a loss in 2009 and to a reduction in a valuation allowance during 2010 primarily related to the utilization of credits.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Such amounts were partially offset by a reduction in tax exempt interest income in 2010 due primarily to lower interest rates.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	The decrease in total revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to lower demand for our advisory and other services and the adverse effect of foreign exchange during 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The effects of foreign exchange resulted in an approximate 2% decrease in total revenues during 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The increase in revenue from research services in 2009 is due in part to our objective to drive a higher percentage of our revenue from research services, which was accomplished in part through greater alignment of our sales compensation plan with this objective, as well as the acquisition of JupiterResearch in July 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	These increases were offset in part by a decline in the number of clients in 2009 due to the global economic slowdown.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P55_S4	The decrease in advisory services and other revenue is reflective of the global economic slowdown in 2009 as well as our objective to drive a higher percentage of revenue from research services.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P55_S5	No single client company accounted for more than 2% of revenues during 2009 or 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The decrease in the dollar amount of cost of services and fulfillment in 2009 compared to 2008 is largely due to lower salary and benefit costs resulting from a lower number of employees in 2009, a decrease in discretionary spending due to management s focus on expense management in light of the global economic downturn, a decrease in outsourced costs and a general freeze in salary increases in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The decrease in the dollar amount of selling and marketing expenses in 2009 is primarily due to a decrease in compensation resulting from lower headcount and lower sales commissions due to lower sales volume in 2009, reduced discretionary spending and a general salary freeze in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The decrease in the dollar amount of general and administrative expenses in 2009 is primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees as approximately $0.9 million of fees were incurred in 2008 related to our historical stock option investigation.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in 2009 is also attributable to lower discretionary spending, lower hiring costs and a general salary freeze in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	The increase in depreciation expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to leasehold improvements completed in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in amortization expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of JupiterResearch on July 31, 2008 and Strategic Oxygen on December 1, 2009, partially offset by a decrease in amortization from an acquisition in 2003 that became fully amortized in 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Reorganization costs in 2009 consist of $3.1 million incurred in the first quarter of 2009 primarily for severance and related benefit costs in connection with the termination of approximately 50 positions and approximately $2.3 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 for costs related to facility consolidations primarily in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Other income, net, which consists primarily of interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses, declined in 2009 primarily due to a decline in interest income resulting from a significant decrease in the rates of return on our investments.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	In 2008 we sold the remainder of our investment in comScore, Inc. and received proceeds of approximately $2.3 million resulting in a gain of approximately $2.0 million.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	In 2009 and 2008, we recognized net losses from our non-marketable investments of approximately $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	remeasurement of a euro-denominated deferred tax liability.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate was reduced by a reduction in a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets that did not recur in 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	We have financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Memberships for research services, which constituted approximately 67% of our revenues during 2010, are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $38.7 million during 2010 and $43.1 million during 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	The decrease in cash provided from operations is primarily attributable to a lower amount of cash generated from working capital in 2010 of $1.9 million compared to $5.4 million in 2009, primarily due to the timing of income tax payments.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	During 2010, we generated $15.6 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $28.9 million in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable investments, which was partially offset by $13.4 million of property and equipment purchases.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Property and equipment purchases in 2010 primarily consisted of leasehold improvements for new facilities as well as purchases of software and computer equipment.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	During 2011, we anticipate spending between $30 million and $35 million for property and equipment purchases, a majority of which will be utilized for the build-out and equipping of our new headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had $15.5 million in escrow, recorded as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which will be utilized to pay for a portion of the build-out of our new headquarters.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	During 2009, we used $59.5 million of cash in investing activities, consisting primarily of $33.5 million used for net purchases of marketable investments and a $16.8 million increase in restricted cash.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	The restricted cash was composed of $14.8 million placed in escrow under a lease signed in 2009 for leasehold improvements for our new headquarters, as well as $2.0 million of the purchase price placed in escrow in connection with our acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009 and which was fully released in the first quarter of 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S5	Investing activities in 2009 also included $5.6 million for acquisitions of businesses and $4.3 million for purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P67_S6	We regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations of investment grade.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	During 2010, we used $61.8 million of cash in financing activities as we paid a special cash dividend in December 2010 of $68.4 million, which represented a payment of $3.00 per share to our common stockholders.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	We do not currently intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	Also in 2010, we used $21.3 million for repurchases of our common stock and received $27.9 from proceeds and related tax benefits from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2010, our board of directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by $60.0 million.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P68_S4	As of December 31, 2010, we had $97.4 remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during 2011.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P68_S5	During 2009, we used $20.4 million to repurchase stock and received approximately $4.3 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we held $9.1 million ($11.0 million at par value) of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and have continued to fail throughout 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	As a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	Based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources, we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on our ARS investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $86.9 million and marketable investments of $129.1 million.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	We do not have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	We plan to continue to introduce new products and services and expect to make the requisite investments in our infrastructure during the next 12 months.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Amount represents a commitment to construct approximately $15.3 million of leasehold improvements under the terms of a build-to-suit lease.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2010, we held approximately $9.1 million ($11.0 million at par value) of municipal notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In February 2008, auctions for these securities began to fail and continued to fail throughout 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	These ARS may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions and have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P6_S3	Based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P6_S4	If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS, based on data available at December 31, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The assumptions used in valuing these ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change, which could result in significant changes to the fair value of these ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	ARS are shown based upon their contractual maturity dates between 2024 and 2034.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Principal amounts by maturity dates in U.S. dollars (dollars in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $1.4 million, $1.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements.
1023313_11_ITEM7A_P12_S1	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro or other foreign currencies.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements listed in the following Index to Financial Statements are filed as a part of this 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audit.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S6	Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Forrester Research, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P5_S2	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P5_S3	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2009 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	( Forrester or the Company ) is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	Forrester s products and services are targeted to 19 specific roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and information technology at $1 billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P11_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P11_S3	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P12_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P12_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P12_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The classification of certain costs within the line items costs of services and fulfillment and selling and marketing has changed from the prior year s consolidated financial statements to properly reflect the nature of those costs.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	The change in classification resulted in an increase to cost of services and fulfillment with a corresponding decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $3.6 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and did not have an effect on total operating expenses or income from operations.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company s investments with an auction reset feature and for which the Company does not have the ability to sell within one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company s investments are composed of securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes some of which contain an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ), corporate notes and bonds and money market funds.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Forrester accounts for all marketable investments, except for ARS that were subject to the right offering with UBS as discussed further in Note 4, as available-for-sale securities and as such are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P20_S3	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P21_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P21_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P21_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company reclassified ARS held by UBS from available-for-sale to trading securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Investments that the Company designates as trading securities are reported at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in gain (losses) on investments, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P24_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	The functional currency of the majority of Forrester s wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currencies.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	These subsidiary financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	Gains and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P30_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Forrester recorded $1.4 million and $1.1 million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P30_S4	Forrester recorded net foreign exchange losses in other income, net related to remeasurement of intercompany transactions of $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, of which $1.9 million related to prior years.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P30_S5	In addition, Forrester s German holding companies, for which the functional currency is the United States dollar, recognized $0.4 million, $(0.6) million and $0.6 million of remeasurement gains (losses) on its deferred tax liability in income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	The components of comprehensive income are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Forrester generates revenues from licensing research, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Forrester executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, services have been provided to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P34_S2	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues, which are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	Losses on consulting project contracts, if any, would be recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P36_S2	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research, which include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Teleconferences, and the right to attend one event, are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P36_S3	Annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Clients are offered a service guarantee, which gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Forrester recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee, which generally equals the vesting period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	Cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock-based awards are classified as financing cash flows.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company is required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P38_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P38_S5	Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the following expense categories (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	The options granted under the equity incentive plans and shares subject to the employee stock purchase plan were valued utilizing the Black Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values:
1023313_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that Forrester had never paid cash dividends until the board of directors approved a special dividend of $3.00 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Company has no present intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forrester s common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P41_S1	The risk-free interest rate used is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P41_S2	Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the award s expected term.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P41_S3	The expected term calculation is based upon Forrester s historical experience of exercise patterns.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of December 31, 2010 was $5.6 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 1.7 years.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P43_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment terms.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	Forrester provides for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, computed using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives of assets as follows:
1023313_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Forrester provides for amortization of intangible assets, computed using an accelerated method according to the expected cash flows to be received from the underlying assets, over the respective lives as follows:
1023313_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	Forrester recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	Forrester s provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P51_S2	The weighted average number of common equivalent shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury-stock method.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Basic and diluted weighted average common shares are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, options to purchase approximately 0.4 million, 2.0 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the diluted weighted average common share calculation as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

1023313_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P55_S3	In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P55_S4	ASU 2009-13 will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P55_S5	The Company will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2011 for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P55_S6	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Effective January 1, 2010 the Company adopted ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	According to the guidance, a reporting entity should provide additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements, and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 fair value measurements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	The adoption of the additional disclosures for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements did not have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	The disclosures regarding Level 3 fair value measurements do not become effective until January 1, 2011 and will not have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted ASU No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	The amendments in this update replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	An approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P57_S3	The amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities, which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P57_S4	The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	On December 1, 2009, Forrester acquired the Strategic Oxygen business to further support Forrester s syndicated business model and the Company s role-based strategy.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	The total purchase price was approximately $7.3 million, of which approximately $4.6 million was paid on the acquisition date, $0.5 million was paid in February 2010 and $0.4 million is payable in June 2011, subject to reduction for indemnification claims.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	The remaining purchase price of $1.8 million represented contingent purchase price valued as of December 1, 2009, which was subject to adjustment based on the achievement of certain financial metrics related to the acquired business.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P58_S3	Of the $1.8 million contingent purchase price, $0.2 million was paid in December 2009 and $1.2 million was paid in February 2010 as full consideration.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P58_S4	At December 31, 2009, the Company maintained approximately $2.0 million in an escrow account classified as restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the contingent purchase price.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P58_S5	The balance of the escrow was fully released in the first quarter of 2010.

1023313_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	The results of Strategic Oxygen, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forrester s consolidated financial statements since December 1, 2009 in the Technology Industry Client Group segment.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	An agreement existed between an employee of Strategic Oxygen, who became an employee of Forrester upon the closing of the acquisition, and the seller of Strategic Oxygen that provided for an allocation of a portion of the contingent consideration from the seller to the employee.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	The contingent consideration was earned by the seller based upon the financial performance of Strategic Oxygen for a short period of time subsequent to the acquisition.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	Forrester was not a party to this agreement; however, this payment in the amount of $0.2 million paid to Forrester s employee by the seller is considered to have resulted in services that benefited Forrester, and therefore the payment was required to be recorded as a non-cash compensation expense, within general and administrative expense, by Forrester and as a capital contribution to Forrester by the seller in 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	On January 22, 2009, Forrester acquired all of the outstanding share capital of Forrester Middle East FZ-LLC (FME), a Dubai, UAE based reseller of Forrester s products that also offered consulting services to local customers, to expand the Company s direct geographical presence in the area.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	The total purchase price was approximately $1.1 million of which approximately $0.6 million was paid on the acquisition date, $0.2 million was paid in 2009 and $0.3 million was contingent upon the acquired company meeting certain financial metrics, which were not met and accordingly the final $0.3 million was not required to be paid by Forrester.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	The results of FME s operations, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forrester s consolidated financial statements since January 22, 2009, with the revenue included within the client group segment to which it relates.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P61_S3	Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.

1023313_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	On July 31, 2008, Forrester acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of JUPR Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings ), the parent company of JupiterResearch, LLC ( JupiterResearch ).
1023313_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	JupiterResearch provided business professionals with syndicated research, analysis, and advice backed by proprietary data.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	The acquisition supported the Company s role-based strategy and added greater depth and breadth to the marketing and strategy syndicated product offering, increased the number of client companies and was expected to reduce operating expenses of the combined entity through economies of scale.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P65_S3	The total consideration was $22.0 million, which consisted of initial cash consideration of $23.0 million less a working capital adjustment of $1.0 million which was received in the fourth quarter of 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P65_S4	The aggregate purchase price of $22.6 million consisted of $22.0 million for the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Holdings common stock, $0.4 million of direct acquisition costs and $0.2 million for severance related to 14 employees of JupiterResearch terminated as a result of the acquisition.

1023313_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The following table summarizes the maturity periods of the marketable securities in the Company s portfolio as of December 31, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	In February 2008, certain ARS that Forrester held experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	The following table reflects the ARS at their contractual maturity dates of between 2024 and 2034 (in thousands).
1023313_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and market value of Forrester s available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporary, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	In November 2008, the Company accepted an offer (the Right ) from UBS AG ( UBS ), one of its investment advisors, entitling the Company to sell at par value auction-rate securities originally purchased from UBS ($29.6 million fair value and $31.7 million par value at December 31, 2009) at any time during a two-year period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012 ( UBS ARS ).
1023313_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	In accepting the Right, the Company also granted UBS the authority to sell or auction the UBS ARS at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released UBS from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of the UBS ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P79_S2	As the Company intended to exercise the Right during 2010, it classified the UBS ARS in current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P79_S3	During 2010, UBS repurchased all of the UBS ARS outstanding at par value.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The enforceability of the Right resulted in a put option that was recognized as a separate freestanding asset and was accounted for separately from the ARS investment.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of the Right was approximately $2.1 million, which is classified as a marketable investment in current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	The Company made an election to measure the Right at fair value in order to match the changes in the fair value of the ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P80_S3	The Company valued the Right using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates and timing and amount of cash flow, based on data available as of December 31, 2009 and adjusted for any bearer risk associated with UBS s financial ability to repurchase the UBS ARS beginning June 30, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	In connection with the acceptance of the UBS offer in November 2008, the Company reclassified its ARS subject to the Right from available-for-sale to trading securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	The transfer to trading securities reflected the Company s intent to exercise its put option during the period June 30, 2010 to July 3, 2012.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	Prior to its agreement with UBS, the Company s intent was to hold the UBS ARS until the earlier of an anticipated recovery in market value or maturity.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	Upon transfer to trading securities, the Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately $6.9 million, included in gains (losses) on investments, net for the year ended December 31, 2008, for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	This amount offset a $6.9 million gain recognized for the initial value of the Right for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company holds additional ARS ($9.1 million fair value and $11.0 million par value at December 31, 2010) with another investment advisor who has not made an offer similar to UBS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	These ARS will continue to be held as available-for-sale and are classified as a long-term asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company intends to retain its investment in these ARS until the earlier of an anticipated recovery in market value or maturity and as a result has not recorded an other-than-temporary loss on these ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	Realized gains or losses on sales of the Company s federal obligations, state and municipal bonds and corporate bonds were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	The following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets (cash equivalents and marketable investments) measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	Included in cash and cash equivalents.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	Level 2 assets consist of the Company s entire portfolio of federal, municipal and corporate bonds, excluding those municipal bonds described below with an auction reset feature.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	Level 2 assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P87_S2	The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P87_S3	These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Level 3 assets at December 31, 2010 consist entirely of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature and at December 31, 2009 also include the UBS Right.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	Prior to 2008, the fair value of the ARS investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	At December 31, 2010, the Company held ARS with one investment advisor that provided a valuation of the ARS at par value, which Forrester considered to be a Level 3 input based on the limited market activity.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P89_S2	In addition to the valuation provided by the investment advisor, Forrester completed a valuation of the securities using a discounted cash flow model that included estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums and expected holding periods of the securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P89_S3	Forrester relied most heavily on its own valuation, based primarily on the lack of market activity in these securities, which resulted in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $1.9 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P89_S4	The Company believes that the loss is temporary due to the strong underlying credit rating of the securities and the fact that the Company does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	Through July 1, 2010, the Company also held ARS with UBS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	Historically, UBS provided a valuation utilizing Level 3 inputs for the ARS investments.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	UBS utilized a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at its valuation, which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared by the Company.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P91_S3	The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates, based on data available at each balance sheet date, of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company valued the UBS Right as an asset using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with UBS s financial ability to repurchase the ARS beginning June 30, 2010, based on data available at each balance sheet date.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	The combined fair value of the Right and the UBS ARS historically equaled the par value of the UBS ARS.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P92_S2	The remaining $5.4 million of par value UBS ARS at June 30, 2010 were sold to UBS at par under the Right on July 1, 2010.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of the Company s non-marketable investments, which were composed primarily of interests in technology-related private equity funds, were $7.4 million and $5.5 million, respectively.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments are limited partnerships and Forrester has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, Forrester records its share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded gains (losses) from its non-marketable investments of approximately $2.3 million, $(1.0) million and $(0.6) million, respectively, which are included in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, gross distributions of $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively, were received from the funds.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	In June 2010, the Company extended the expiration date of a cash bonus plan, originally adopted in 2000, that would pay a bonus, after the return of invested capital from certain of the Company s non-marketable investments, to certain key employees.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	To date, no bonuses have been paid under the plan and no amounts are accrued as of December 31, 2010 as payments under the plan were not considered probable.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P97_S2	The plan will now automatically expire on June 30, 2013, subject to earlier expiration as provided in the plan in the event that prior to such date there are less than 10 participants in the plan or all of the Company s invested capital (as defined in the plan) has been returned to the Company.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	Income from continuing operations before income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 consists of the following (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	The components of the income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to Forrester s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:
1023313_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P102_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P102_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $2.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition, foreign tax credit carryforwards and U.S. capital losses.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $17.1 million obtained from acquired businesses.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	If unused, these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019 through 2028.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $32.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	Approximately $5.6 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P105_S2	The Company has a German net operating loss against which it had provided a full valuation allowance in prior years.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P105_S3	During 2010 the Company reconsidered its position and determined that the ability of the Company to benefit from the net operating loss did not meet the more likely than not standard.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P105_S4	Accordingly, the deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance for the German net operating loss have been removed from the components of deferred taxes with no effect to the Company s overall tax provision.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $2.2 million, of which $1.0 million expires in 2012 and $1.2 million expires in 2014.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table provides a summary of the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
1023313_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, the Company recognized approximately $5.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively, of tax benefits from excess tax deductions resulting from employee stock option exercises.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	The tax benefit was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P108_S2	Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized in the year that the deduction reduces the amount of cash payable for taxes.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P108_S3	No such tax benefits were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2009.
1023313_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	Undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $0.8 million as of December 31, 2010.

1023313_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

1023313_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those set forth in forward-looking statements made by us.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties include: A Decline in Renewals for Our Membership-Based Research Services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our research products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Business may be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If conditions in the United States and global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our research and advisory services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We have clients in over 60 countries and approximately 30% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients of the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research analysts, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research to meet the changing information needs of our clients.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches that could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We compete in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We may also face increased competition from Internet-based research firms.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, information-gathering, and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies, survey-based general market research firms and general business consulting firms.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P8_S8	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Trends in technology spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our research services from clients.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The hiring and training of new analysts and sales personnel.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Changes in demand for our research and advisory services.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	We May Realize Losses on Our Investments or Be Unable to Liquidate These Investments at Desired Times and in Desired Amounts.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $9.6 million of long-term marketable investments in municipal notes with an auction reset feature.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In February 2008, auctions had begun to fail for these securities and have continued to fail, which means that the parties wishing to sell securities in the normal auction process could not.
1023313_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	In August 2011, we moved into a new corporate headquarters building, comprised of approximately 190,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, substantially all of which is currently occupied by the Company.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates research, marketing, sales, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	In 2011, we entered into a new lease for approximately 15,600 square feet in San Francisco, with a 63-month term that commenced April 1, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	15,200 square feet, with an initial term of ten years until December 31, 2020.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	The London lease is for approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term of eleven years until September 24, 2021.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	In December 2010 we paid a one-time special cash dividend of $3.00 per share to holders of shares of our common stock.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	We did not declare or pay any dividends during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P0_S3	In February 2012 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share payable on March 21, 2012 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to begin paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 6, 2012 there were approximately 41 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 6, 2012 the closing price of our common stock was $32.00 per share.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	The following table represents the ranges of high and low sale prices of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: Through 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an aggregate $260.0 million to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program (first announced in 2002), including $60.0 million authorized in 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P1_S3	During the quarter ended December 31, 2011 we did not purchase any shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2011 we had repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $181.0 million.
1023313_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2011 with the cumulative return during the same period for the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S. Companies) and the Russell 2000, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were reinvested.
1023313_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	Cash dividends declared in 2010 represent a special dividend of $3.00 per common share declared and paid in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	The 2009 operating income amount includes a $5.4 million reorganization charge for facility consolidations and a reduction-in-force of approximately 50 employees.
1023313_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1023313_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	The results of JupiterResearch, LLC, and its parent company, JUPR Holdings, Inc. ( JupiterResearch ) are included in our consolidated results beginning July 31, 2008, the date of acquisition.
1023313_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	The 2008 other income amount includes a net foreign exchange loss of approximately $1.6 million ($1.2 million after tax) resulting primarily from the remeasurement of certain intercompany payables and receivables.
1023313_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	Of the net $1.6 million loss, approximately $1.9 million related to periods prior to 2008.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to our research products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting events.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our research.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S6	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P1_S7	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Deferred revenue and agreement value have increased consistently on an annual basis during 2010 and 2011 due to increased demand for our products and services as the economy has improved during those periods and as we have increased the number of sales personnel during both 2010 and 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase in agreement value during 2010 was partially offset by a change in the calculation to exclude agreement value in excess of the first year for multiple year contracts signed in 2009 and beyond, which reduced the growth rate in 2010 by approximately 6%.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Client retention, dollar retention, enrichment, and the number of clients have all increased from 2009 levels, which is consistent with an improved economic environment, and our retention metrics are near historic highs at December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Effective January 1, 2011 we adopted Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13).
1023313_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	ASU 2009-13 updates the previous multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Issue 00-21 by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research (including our data products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the discount is applied ratably to the research and data products only (which commence delivery on the first day of the contract), as the undelivered products in the contract (advisory services or events) would be refundable to the customer at list price.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	We obtain the selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Teleconferences, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Contracts for RoleView research entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January 1, 2011, were accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Contracts for RoleView research entered into or significantly modified after January 1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of determining selling prices as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in our case.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We offer our clients a service guarantee, which gives our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Furthermore, our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives and forfeiture rates.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	We are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	In addition, for our performance-vested restricted stock units, we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	If our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimates, or if our estimates of forfeitures or performance outcomes are modified in a future period, the actual stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	For example, during 2011 we modified our estimates of the performance outcome for RSUs issued during 2009 and 2010 that resulted in a credit of $0.9 million being recorded in 2011 related to expense recognized in prior periods related to these RSUs.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $7.9 million at December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had $81.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2011 and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S5	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P32_S6	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships, technology, research content, and trademarks, and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P38_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P38_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Investments.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The assessment of the fair value of certain of the debt securities (e.g. those containing an auction reset feature) can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these debt instruments.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements, we have classified our marketable investments as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we held municipal bonds with a fair value of $9.6 million ($11.0 million at par value) with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	The fair value of the ARS was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, which is considered a Level 3 valuation.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates, based on data available at December 31, 2011, of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change, which may lead us in the future to record additional losses for these securities.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	We classified these ARS as available-for-sale securities and determined that the losses were not considered other-than-temporary and were not due to credit losses.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	Accordingly, changes in the market value of the ARS have been recorded in other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S6	If market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record unrealized losses in other comprehensive loss or impairment charges within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P41_S7	We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	At December 31, 2011, we held $138.0 million of marketable investments that were valued using Level 2 inputs.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Level 2 investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, by our investment managers utilizing third party pricing services, which consists of one price per instrument.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	We do not obtain pricing or quotes from brokers directly and historically we have not adjusted prices obtained from our investment managers for our non-ARS portfolio.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	We verify the pricing information obtained from our investment managers by obtaining an understanding of the pricing methodology and inputs utilized by the pricing services to value our particular investments, as well as an understanding of the controls and procedures utilized by our investment managers to both ensure the accurate recording and to validate the pricing of our investments obtained from the pricing services on an annual basis.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	Our marketable investments consist solely of high credit quality corporate and municipal bonds with a weighted average credit rating AA and do not include difficult to value features.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	The majority of our marketable investments are in large corporate notes.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P42_S6	We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The increase in total revenues in 2011 is principally the result of increased demand for our products and services and the acquisition of Springboard Research in May 2011, which accounted for approximately 1% of revenue growth.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The effects of foreign exchange resulted in an approximate 1% increase in total revenues during 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Revenue growth in 2011 was driven by a 20% increase in the marketing and strategy client group, a 14% increase in the technology industry client group (approximately 2% due to Springboard Research), and a 7% increase in the business technology client group.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	economy and an increase in the number of sales personnel in 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Revenue growth outside of the U.S. outpaced the growth in the U.S., due in part to faster growth in the Asia Pacific region.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Including the effect of foreign exchange, revenue earned outside of the U.S. increased by 2% as a percent of total revenues in 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	We count co-located events, which enable our clients to attend multiple events with one event ticket, as a single event in the table above.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment in dollars during 2011 is primarily the result of increased compensation and benefits principally due to an increase in research and fulfillment employees, increased facility costs, and increased travel and entertainment expense due in part to an all-employee meeting in the first quarter of 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	These increases were partially offset by a reduction of approximately $3.9 million of incentive compensation earned with respect to the third and fourth quarters of 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Facility costs recorded in costs of services and fulfillment increased approximately $2.9 million during 2011 primarily due to us incurring lease costs for both our new corporate headquarters and our previous headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and also due to a higher level of costs for our new corporate headquarters.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	We recognized approximately eight months of lease costs in 2011 for our new headquarters during the construction period as we had access to the facility for construction purposes prior to our occupancy at the end of August 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	Our lease at our prior headquarters expired on September 30, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P50_S5	The decrease in cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues during 2011 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the reduction in the amount of incentive bonus earned with respect to the current year.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2011 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees and an increase in sales commissions.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	Increased sales of our syndicated research services products are generally recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	The increase is also attributable to increased travel and entertainment expense and increased facility costs.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	Facility costs recorded in selling and marketing increased approximately $2.1 million during 2011 primarily due to us incurring duplicate lease costs as described above under cost of services and fulfillment .
1023313_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	In the first quarter of 2012, we realigned our sales force to simplify the selling process to our customers and to increase the productivity of our sales organization.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The realignment resulted in the elimination of approximately 11 sales and marketing positions in the first quarter of 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	The decrease in general and administrative expense in dollars and as percent of total revenue during 2011 is primarily due a reduction of approximately $1.6 million of incentive compensation earned with respect to the third and fourth quarters of 2011, the capitalization of approximately $1.6 million of internal information technology salary costs in 2011 for the build of our new client-facing website that was launched in 2012, and a decrease of approximately $0.6 million in stock compensation expense.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	These decreases were partially offset by an increase in facility costs, an increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in the number of general and administrative employees and salary increases during 2011, and acquisition and integration costs for Springboard Research of approximately $0.7 million.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	Facility costs recorded in general and administrative expense increased approximately $0.8 million during 2011 primarily due to us incurring duplicate lease costs as described above under cost of services and fulfillment .
1023313_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	The increase in depreciation expense during 2011 is primarily due to the initiation of depreciation for our new corporate headquarters in August 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	We expect depreciation expense in future periods to increase from the current period level due to our new corporate headquarters and the launch of our website and other customer facing technologies in 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	The decrease in amortization expense during 2011 is primarily due to certain intangible assets from the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009 becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of 2011, partially offset by an increase in amortization from the acquisition of Springboard Research in May 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In the first quarter of 2012 we realigned our sales force to simplify the selling process to our customers and to increase the productivity of our sales force.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The reorganization costs incurred in 2011 consist of severance and related benefits for three employees located outside of the U.S. based on statutory termination benefits in their country of employment and the fact that termination was considered probable at December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	We expect to incur approximately $1.3 million to $1.5 million of additional costs in the first half of 2012 for severance and related costs for the termination of approximately 17 additional employees related to the sales realignment and other related cost reduction initiatives.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	Other Income, Net The decrease in other income, net during 2011 is primarily due to lower interest income from lower returns on our investments.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Gains (losses) on investments primarily represent our share of equity method investment gains and losses from our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in gains during 2011 is primarily due to a smaller increase in the valuations of certain assets within the funds in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The effective tax rate has remained relatively consistent from 2010 to 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The increase in total revenues in 2010 is principally the result of increased demand for our products and services and the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009, which accounted for approximately 1.9% of revenue growth.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The effects of foreign exchange resulted in an approximate 1% decrease in total revenues during 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	Revenue growth in 2010 was driven by a 12% increase in the technology industry client group (approximately 6.7% due to Strategic Oxygen), a 12% increase in the marketing and strategy client group and a 16% increase for events.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Revenue in the business technology client group was essentially flat for the year.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	Overall revenue growth was due in part to the improvement in the economy and an increase in the number of sales personnel in 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P58_S5	Revenue growth in the U.S. outpaced the growth in Europe, due in part to a stronger economy in the U.S. relative to Europe, resulting in a decrease of 2% in the percentage of revenue earned outside of the U.S.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	We count co-located events, which enable our clients to attend multiple events with one event ticket, as a single event in the table above.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in the dollar amount of cost of services and fulfillment during 2010 is primarily the result of increased compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and an increase in incentive compensation, increased travel-related costs and costs resulting from the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	This increase was partially offset by stock-based compensation expense in 2009 from the accelerated vesting of performance-based stock options.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Selling and Marketing The increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2010 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees and an increase in sales commissions and bonuses.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase is also attributable to increased travel-related costs.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Increased sales of our syndicated research services products are generally recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2010 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in the number of general and administrative employees to support our growth plan, and to an increase in bonuses.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase is also attributable to increased investments in customer facing technology.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	The decrease in depreciation expense during 2010 is primarily due to lower amortization of leasehold improvements due to facility consolidations in 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	The increase in amortization expense during 2010 is primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Reorganization costs in 2009 consist of $3.1 million incurred in the first quarter of 2009 primarily for severance and related benefit costs in connection with the termination of approximately 50 positions and approximately $2.3 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 for costs related to facility consolidations primarily in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	The decrease in other income, net during 2010 is primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower returns on invested capital.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Gains (losses) on investments primarily represent our share of equity method investment gains and losses from our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase in gains during 2010 is primarily due to increased valuations of certain assets within the funds in 2010 as compared to net decreases in valuations during 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	Provision for Income Taxes The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2010 is primarily due to a non-cash foreign exchange rate gain on the remeasurement of a euro-denominated deferred tax liability in 2010 as compared to a loss in 2009 and to a reduction in a valuation allowance during 2010 primarily related to the utilization of credits.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	Such amounts were partially offset by a reduction in tax exempt interest income in 2010 due primarily to lower interest rates.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Memberships for research services, which constituted approximately 68% of our revenues during 2011, are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $55.4 million, $38.7 million and $43.1 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S3	The increase in cash provided from operations in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to both a reduction in the amount of income taxes paid during 2011 of $10.7 million, primarily due to a deferral of payments, and to an increase in net income of $2.5 million.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S4	The decrease in cash provided from operations in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable a lower amount of cash generated from working capital in 2010 of $1.9 million compared to $5.4 million in 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S5	During 2011 we used $53.0 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $20.8 million of net purchases of marketable investments, $39.8 million of purchases of property and equipment and $7.5 million for acquisitions.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S6	The property and equipment purchases were partially funded by $14.5 million of restricted cash that had been placed in escrow in 2009 for such purchases.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S7	Property and equipment purchases during 2011 consisted primarily of leasehold improvements for new facilities and also included purchases of software and computer equipment.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P69_S8	During 2010, we generated $15.6 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $28.9 million of proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable investments, which was partially offset by $13.4 million of property and equipment purchases.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Property and equipment purchases in 2010 primarily consisted of leasehold improvements for new facilities as well as purchases of software and computer equipment.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	We expect property and equipment purchases to be in a range of $5.0 million to $8.0 million in 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	We used $6.3 million of cash from financing activities during 2011 resulting from $18.4 million of purchases of our common stock, partially offset by $11.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we had $79.0 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during 2012, as market conditions warrant.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	During 2010, we used $61.8 million of cash in financing activities as we paid a special cash dividend in December 2010 of $68.4 million, which represented a payment of $3.00 per share to our common stockholders.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	Also in 2010, we used $21.3 million for purchases of our common stock and received $27.9 million from proceeds and related tax benefits from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S6	In February 2012 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share payable on March 21, 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P70_S7	We intend to begin paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we held $9.6 million ($11.0 million at par value) of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	securities and have continued to fail throughout 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	As a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	Based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources, we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity with our ARS investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $81.0 million and marketable investments of $146.6 million.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	Cash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were $31.4 million at December 31, 2011, of which $1.4 million represents undistributed earnings that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S5	We do not have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S6	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years.
1023313_12_ITEM7_P72_S7	As of December 31, 2011, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

1023313_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2011, we held approximately $9.6 million ($11.0 million at par value) of municipal notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	In February 2008, auctions for these securities began to fail and continued to fail throughout 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	These ARS may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions and have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P5_S3	If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS, based on data available at December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The assumptions used in valuing these ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change, which could result in significant changes to the fair value of these ARS.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	ARS are shown based upon their contractual maturity dates between 2024 and 2034.

1023313_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P10_S2	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $1.3 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements.
1023313_12_ITEM7A_P12_S1	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro or other foreign currencies.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Forrester Research, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P0_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1023313_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P7_S1	Forrester s products and services are targeted to specific roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and information technology principally at $1 billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P7_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P7_S3	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P8_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P8_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P8_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	Certain line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been combined to conform to the current period presentation.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P10_S2	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P10_S3	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company s investments with an auction reset feature and for which the Company does not have the ability to sell within one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The Company s investments are composed of securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes some of which contain an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ), corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P13_S1	Forrester accounts for all marketable investments as available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P13_S2	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P13_S3	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P14_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P19_S2	Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P20_S1	To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P20_S2	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as non-current liabilities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	Non-current deferred rent liability at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $6.7 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and primarily results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Company s facility leases.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	The portion of the deferred rent corresponding to rent payments that will be paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date is classified as a current liability.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The functional currency of the majority of Forrester s wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currencies.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	These subsidiary financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	Gains and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Forrester recorded $1.3 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	In addition, Forrester s German holding companies, for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, recognized $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $(0.6) million of remeasurement gains (losses) on its deferred tax liability in income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P22_S5	The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	The components of comprehensive income are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2011 the Company adopted Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13) for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	Issue 00-21 by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	Forrester generates revenues from licensing research (including our data products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Forrester executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P28_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Revenue contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products and services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company obtains the selling prices of its products and services based on an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues, which are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Teleconferences, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S6	Contracts for RoleView research entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January 1, 2011 are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S7	Contracts for RoleView research entered into or significantly modified after January 1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period, based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of determining selling price as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in this case.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P30_S8	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each of these elements based upon their relative selling prices, which is based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	Clients are offered a service guarantee, which gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee, which generally equals the vesting period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock-based awards are classified as financing cash flows.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company is required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P33_S3	The Company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	In addition, for performance-vested restricted stock units, the Company makes estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P34_S2	Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the following expense categories (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	The options granted under the equity incentive plans and shares subject to the employee stock purchase plan were valued utilizing the Black Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values: The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that Forrester had never paid cash dividends until the board of directors approved a special dividend of $3.00 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forrester s common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The risk-free interest rate used is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the award s expected term.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	The expected term calculation is based upon Forrester s historical experience of exercise patterns.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of December 31, 2011 was $5.2 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 1.5 years.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment terms.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Depreciation and Amortization Forrester provides for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, computed using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives of assets as follows:
1023313_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Shorter of asset life or lease term Forrester provides for amortization of intangible assets, computed using an accelerated method according to the expected cash flows to be received from the underlying assets, over the respective lives as follows:
1023313_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	1 Year Income Taxes Forrester recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Forrester s provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P44_S3	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P44_S4	The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P44_S5	The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	The weighted average number of common equivalent shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury-stock method.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Basic and diluted weighted average common shares are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, options to purchase approximately 0.3 million, 0.4 million and 2.0 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the diluted weighted average common share calculation as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	The new guidance clarifies the concepts applicable for fair value measurement of non-financial assets and requires the disclosure of quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and will be applied prospectively.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	In June 2011, the FASB amended its accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI) in an entity s financial statements.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	The amended guidance eliminates the option to present the components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and provides two options for presenting OCI: in a statement included in the income statement or in a separate statement immediately following the income statement.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	The amendments do not change the guidance for the items that have to be reported in OCI or when an item of OCI has to be moved into net income.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S3	This guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S4	The Company does not anticipate that its adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated results.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S5	In September 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S6	The updated guidance gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S7	The amendment is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S8	The updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P50_S9	The Company does not anticipate that its adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated results.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	(2) Acquisitions Springboard Research On May 12, 2011, Forrester acquired Springboard Research ( Springboard ), a provider of research and advisory services focused on Asia Pacific and emerging markets.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	Springboard was a former division of Knowledge Platform, Inc.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	The acquisition of the Springboard business further supports Forrester s role-based strategy and expands Forrester s coverage in the Asia Pacific region.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P51_S3	The total purchase price was approximately $9.0 million, of which approximately $6.7 million was paid on the acquisition date and $2.3 million (the Holdback ) is payable at various times through June 1, 2013, subject to possible reduction to satisfy indemnification claims and specified contingencies.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	retained by the Company if certain key employees do not remain with the Company through May 12, 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, up to $0.5 million of the Holdback could have been retained by the Company if a certain Springboard facility lease had not been extended through September 15, 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	As of December 31, 2011, $0.5 million of the Holdback had been paid by the Company and $0.9 million and $0.9 million of the Holdback are recorded in accrued expenses and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	The results of Springboard, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forrester s consolidated financial statements since May 12, 2011 in the Technology Industry Client Group segment.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P52_S4	Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P52_S5	A summary of the purchase price allocation for Springboard is as follows (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	Approximately $2.1 million of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company believes the goodwill reflects its expectations of synergistic revenue opportunities from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Intangible assets are amortized according to the expected cash flows to be received.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	The following are the identifiable intangible assets acquired and their respective weighted average lives (dollars in thousands): Strategic Oxygen On December 1, 2009, Forrester acquired the Strategic Oxygen business to further support the Company s role-based strategy.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P54_S2	The total purchase price was approximately $7.3 million, of which approximately $4.6 million was paid on the acquisition date, $0.5 million was paid in 2010 and $0.4 million was paid in June 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P54_S3	The remaining purchase price of $1.8 million represented contingent purchase price valued as of December 1, 2009, which was subject to adjustment based on the achievement of certain financial metrics related to the acquired business.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	and $1.2 million was paid in February 2010 as full consideration.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company recorded a credit of approximately $0.5 million within general and administrative expense during 2010 as a result of a reduction in the estimated amount of contingent purchase price from December 31, 2009 to the final calculation date.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	The results of Strategic Oxygen, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forrester s consolidated financial statements since December 1, 2009 in the Technology Industry Client Group segment.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	An agreement existed between an employee of Strategic Oxygen, who became an employee of Forrester upon the closing of the acquisition, and the seller of Strategic Oxygen that provided for an allocation of a portion of the contingent consideration from the seller to the employee.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	The contingent consideration was earned by the seller based upon the financial performance of Strategic Oxygen for a short period of time subsequent to the acquisition.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	Forrester was not a party to this agreement; however, this payment in the amount of $0.2 million paid to Forrester s employee by the seller is considered to have resulted in services that benefited Forrester, and therefore the payment was required to be recorded as a non-cash compensation expense, within general and administrative expense, by Forrester and as a capital contribution to Forrester by the seller in 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Forrester Middle East FZ-LLC On January 22, 2009, Forrester acquired all of the outstanding share capital of Forrester Middle East FZ-LLC (FME), a Dubai, UAE based reseller of Forrester s products that also offered consulting services to local customers, to expand the Company s direct geographical presence in the area.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The total purchase price was approximately $1.1 million of which approximately $0.6 million was paid on the acquisition date, $0.2 million was paid in 2009 and $0.3 million was contingent upon the acquired company meeting certain financial metrics, which were not met and accordingly the final $0.3 million was not required to be paid by Forrester.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	The Company recorded a credit of $0.3 million within general and administrative expense during 2009 as a result of the reduction in the contingent purchase price.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	The results of FME s operations, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forrester s consolidated financial statements since January 22, 2009, with the revenue included within the client group segment to which it relates.

1023313_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The following table summarizes the maturity periods of the marketable securities in the Company s portfolio as of December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	In February 2008, certain ARS that Forrester held experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	These auction failures have continued throughout 2011 and based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	The following table reflects the ARS at their contractual maturity dates of between 2024 and 2034 (in thousands).
1023313_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and market value of Forrester s available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporary, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company holds ARS with a fair value of $9.6 million and a par value of $11.0 million at December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	These ARS will continue to be held as available-for-sale and are classified as a long-term asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P68_S2	The Company intends to retain its investment in these ARS until the earlier of an anticipated recovery in market value or maturity and as a result has not recorded an other-than-temporary loss on these ARS.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Realized gains or losses on sales of the Company s federal obligations, state and municipal bonds and corporate bonds were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	The following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets (cash equivalents and marketable investments) measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

1023313_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	(2) $1.0 million included in cash and cash equivalents.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	Level 2 assets consist of the Company s entire portfolio of federal, state, municipal and corporate bonds, excluding those municipal bonds described below with an auction reset feature.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P71_S2	Level 2 assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P71_S3	The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation methods, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P71_S4	These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Level 3 assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 consist entirely of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (ARS).
1023313_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	Prior to 2008, the fair value of the ARS investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P72_S2	While the Company continues to earn interest on its ARS investments at the contractual rate, these investments trade infrequently and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P72_S3	Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P72_S4	At December 31, 2011, the Company held ARS with one investment advisor.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Company values the ARS using a discounted cash flow model that includes estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums and expected holding periods of the securities, which is considered a Level 3 valuation.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	The valuation resulted in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $1.4 million at December 31, 2011 and $1.9 million at December 31, 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	temporary due to the strong underlying credit rating of the securities and the fact that the Company does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	Through July 1, 2010, the Company also held ARS with UBS AG (UBS).
1023313_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	Historically, UBS provided a valuation utilizing Level 3 inputs for the ARS investments.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P76_S2	UBS utilized a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at its valuation, which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared by the Company.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P76_S3	The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates, based on data available at each balance sheet date, of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	In November 2008, the Company accepted an offer (the Right ) from UBS entitling the Company to sell at par value ARS originally purchased from UBS at any time during a two-year period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Company valued the Right as an asset using a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest rates and timing and amount of cash flows, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with UBS s financial ability to repurchase the ARS beginning June 30, 2010, based on data available at each balance sheet date.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P77_S2	The combined fair value of the Right and the UBS ARS historically equaled the par value of the UBS ARS.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P77_S3	The remaining $5.4 million of par value UBS ARS at June 30, 2010 were sold to UBS at par under the Right on July 1, 2010.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P77_S4	The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1023313_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	(5) Non-Marketable Investments At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value of the Company s non-marketable investments, which were composed primarily of interests in technology-related private equity funds, were $7.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	One of the Company s investments, with a book value of $1.5 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is being accounted for using the cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments are limited partnerships and Forrester has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, Forrester records its share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	are included in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, gross distributions of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were received from the funds.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	In June 2010, the Company extended the expiration date of a cash bonus plan, originally adopted in 2000, that would pay a bonus, after the return of invested capital from certain of the Company s non-marketable investments, to certain key employees.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	To date, no bonuses have been paid under the plan and no amounts are accrued as of December 31, 2011 as payments under the plan were not considered probable.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P80_S2	The plan will now automatically expire on June 30, 2013, subject to earlier expiration as provided in the plan in the event that prior to such date there are less than 10 participants in the plan or all of the Company s invested capital (as defined in the plan) has been returned to the Company.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	(6) Income Taxes Income from continuing operations before income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 consists of the following (in thousands):

1023313_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to Forrester s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:
1023313_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands): Current net deferred tax assets and long-term net deferred tax assets were $0 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and $4.1 million and $7.8 million as of December 31, 2010, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	Current net deferred tax liabilities and long-term net deferred tax liabilities were $0.4 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and $0 and $5.5 million as of December 31, 2010, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $3.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition and U.S. capital losses.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $12.8 million obtained from acquired businesses.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S2	These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S3	If unused, these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019 through 2028.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S4	The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $31.6 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S5	Approximately $5.8 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S6	The Company has a German net operating loss against which it had provided a full valuation allowance in prior years.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S7	During 2010 the Company reconsidered its position and determined that the ability of the Company to benefit from the net operating loss did not meet the more likely than not standard.
1023313_12_ITEM8_P85_S8	Accordingly, the deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance for the German net operating loss have been removed from the components of deferred taxes with no effect to the Company s overall tax provision.

1023313_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) of the Treadway Commission.
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1023313_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ending December 31, 2011 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

1023313_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	GRANT OF OPTIONS Each person who is a Participant on the first day of an Option Period will as of such day be granted an Option for such Option Period.
1023313_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	Such Option will be for the number of whole shares (not in excess of the share maximum as hereinafter defined) of Stock to be determined by dividing (i) the balance in the Participant s withholding account on the last day of the Option Period, by (ii) the option price per share of the Stock determined under Section 7.

1023313_12_ITEM15_P15_S3	A good faith determination by the Board of Directors as to fair market value shall be final and binding.
1023313_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	EXERCISE OF OPTIONS; ISSUANCE OF STOCK Subject to the limitations in Section 18, each Eligible Employee who is a Participant in the Plan on the last day of an Option Period shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option on such date and thereby to have purchased from Forrester such number of full shares of Stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan, as the Participant s accumulated payroll deductions will purchase at the Option Price, subject to the limitation described in Sections 3(b) and 6.
1023313_12_ITEM15_P16_S1	Upon such exercise, the balance of the Participant s withholding account shall be applied to the purchase of the number of whole shares of Stock determined under Section 6 and as soon as practicable thereafter a book entry shall be made in the stock ledger of the Company to evidence the issuance of shares to the Participant.
1023313_12_ITEM15_P16_S2	Shares of Stock purchased upon exercise of an Option shall be issued only in the name of the Participant.

1023313_12_ITEM15_P16_S4	In the event that the balance of the Participant s withholding account following an Option Period is in excess of the total purchase price of the shares so issued, the balance of the withholding account shall be returned to the Participant; provided , however , that if the balance left in the withholding account consists solely of an amount equal to the value of a fractional share, it shall be retained in the withholding account and carried over to the next succeeding Option Period, but no other amounts may be carried forward.
1023313_12_ITEM15_P16_S5	The entire balance of the Participant s withholding account following the final Option Period shall be returned to the Participant.

1023313_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	Any shares of Stock issued under this Plan to a Participant pursuant to the exercise of an Option granted on or after March 1, 2012 may not be sold, assigned, pledged, encumbered, or otherwise transferred by such Participant for a period of one (1) year after the exercise date of the applicable Option.
1023313_12_ITEM15_P17_S1	By purchasing Stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option, the Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions on the transferability of shares of Stock.

1023313_12_ITEM15_P17_S3	In the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the Stock or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Forrester, or a merger or similar transaction in which Forrester is not the surviving corporation or which results in the acquisition of Forrester by another person, the Board in its sole discretion will (a) if Forrester is merged with or acquired by another corporation, provide that each Option will be assumed or a substitute Option granted by the acquiror or successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the acquiror or successor corporation, (b) cancel each Option and return the balances in Participants withholding accounts to the Participants, (c) pursuant to Section 17, accelerate the exercise date of each Option to a date on or before the date of the proposed sale or merger, or (d) permit each Option to continue unchanged.

1023313_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 3.

1023313_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	These risks and uncertainties include: A Decline in Renewals for Our Membership-Based Research Services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our Business may be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If conditions in the United States and global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our research and advisory services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We have clients in approximately 60 countries and approximately 28% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients of the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research analysts, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We have also experienced challenges with effectively implementing changes to our sales organization, and our future success will depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research to meet the changing information needs of our clients.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We compete in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We may also face increased competition from Internet-based research firms.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, information-gathering, and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies, survey-based general market research firms and general business consulting firms.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P10_S8	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Trends in technology spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our research services from clients.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The hiring and training of new analysts and sales personnel.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Changes in demand for our research and advisory services.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As disclosed in Item 9A of this report, we have identified a material weakness as of December 31, 2012 in our internal control over financial reporting because we did not maintain effective controls over revenue related to our advisory services and consulting projects.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our management has taken action to begin remediating this material weakness, but we cannot be certain when remediation will have been completed.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In future periods, we may identify additional deficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting that may require remediation.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	There can be no assurances that any such future deficiencies identified may not be material weaknesses that would be required to be reported in future periods.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We May Realize Losses on Our Investments or Be Unable to Liquidate These Investments at Desired Times and in Desired Amounts.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $9.0 million of long-term marketable investments in municipal notes with an auction reset feature.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In February 2008, auctions had begun to fail for these securities and have continued to fail, which means that the parties wishing to sell securities in the normal auction process could not.
1023313_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters building is comprised of approximately 190,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, substantially all of which is currently occupied by the Company.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates research, marketing, sales, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Paris and New Delhi.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	In 2012 we entered into a new lease for approximately 14,000 square feet in New Delhi, with a nine-year term (cancellable after three years) that expires July 12, 2021.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our San Francisco lease is for approximately 19,000 square feet, with a 63-month term that expires June 30, 2016.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S6	Our New York lease is for approximately 15,200 square feet, with an initial term of ten years until December 31, 2020.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S7	The London lease is for approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term of eleven years until September 24, 2021.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S8	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_13_ITEM2_P0_S9	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR .
1023313_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	We did not declare or pay any dividends during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	In February 2012 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per that was paid on March 21, 2012, and quarterly dividends of $0.14 per share were subsequently declared and paid in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	On February 13, 2013, we announced an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 13, 2013 there were approximately 42 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 13, 2013 the closing price of our common stock was $29.32 per share.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table represents the ranges of high and low sale prices of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011: Through 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an aggregate $310.0 million to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program, including $50.0 million authorized in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2012 we had repurchased approximately 9.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $210.8 million.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	During the quarter ended December 31, 2012 we repurchased the following shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) All purchases of our common stock were made under the stock repurchase program first announced in 2001.
1023313_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2012 with the cumulative return during the same period for the Nasdaq Stock Market (U.S. Companies) and the Russell 2000, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were reinvested.
1023313_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	The 2009 operating income amount includes a $5.4 million reorganization charge for facility consolidations and a reduction-in-force of approximately 50 employees.
1023313_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	The results of JupiterResearch, LLC, and its parent company, JUPR Holdings, Inc. ( JupiterResearch ) are included in our consolidated results beginning July 31, 2008, the date of acquisition.
1023313_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	The 2012 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes $0.8 million ($0.5 million after tax) of losses on investments of which $1.4 million of losses ($0.8 million after tax) relate to 2011 and $0.6 million ($0.3 million after tax) of gains relate to prior periods.
1023313_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	The 2008 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes a net foreign exchange loss of approximately $1.6 million ($1.2 million after tax) resulting primarily from the remeasurement of certain intercompany payables and receivables.
1023313_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	Of the net $1.6 million loss, approximately $1.9 million related to periods prior to 2008.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to our research products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting events.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S4	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our research.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S7	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P0_S8	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention, enrichment and number of clients are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Clients we count as a single client the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent and we also aggregate separate instrumentalities of the federal, state, and provincial governments as single clients.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Agreement value at December 31, 2012 showed a decline of less than 1% from December 31, 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The year-over-year growth rates in agreement value trended downward during each consecutive quarter of 2012 primarily due to a continuing decrease in our enrichment rates, which, at 95% for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2012, represents a 6% decrease from the prior period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	We attribute the decline in the enrichment rate to the challenges associated with the implementation of the sales reorganization in January 2012 combined with high sales employee attrition during 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	Client retention, dollar retention and number of clients at December 31, 2012 remain near historical levels.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Deferred revenue and agreement value increased significantly at December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 due to increased demand for our products and services due to the improvements in the economy during this period and as we increased the number of sales personnel during both 2010 and 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	Effective in 2012, we modified our calculation of the number of clients in accordance with an automated system that counts as a single client the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent and also aggregates separate instrumentalities of federal, state, and provincial governments.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	The number of clients as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 has been recalculated to conform to the current methodology; however 2011 and 2010 client and dollar retention and enrichment are not recalculated.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P11_S7	Accordingly, the client and dollar retention and enrichment percentages at December 31, 2012 are directionally but not absolutely indicative of the actual change from the comparable period in 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Effective January 1, 2011 we adopted Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	ASU 2009-13 updates the previous multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	Issue 00-21 by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research (including our data products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the discount is applied ratably to the research and data products only (which commence delivery on the first day of the contract), as the undelivered products in the contract (advisory services or events) would be refundable to the customer at list price.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We obtain the selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Contracts for RoleView research entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January 1, 2011, were accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Contracts for RoleView research entered into or significantly modified after January 1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of determining selling prices as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in our case.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	For contracts entered into through January 2013, we offered our clients a service guarantee, which gives our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Furthermore, our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, dividend yields and forfeiture rates.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Expected dividend yields are based on expectations of current and future dividends, if any.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	We are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S3	We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S4	In addition, for our performance-vested restricted stock units, we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S5	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S6	If our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimates, or if our estimates of forfeitures or performance outcomes are modified in a future period, the actual stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P26_S7	For example, during 2011 we modified our estimates of the performance outcome for RSUs issued during 2009 and 2010 that resulted in a credit of $0.9 million being recorded in 2011 related to expense recognized in prior periods related to these RSUs.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $6.9 million at December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had $86.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	November 30, 2012 and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships, technology, research content, and trademarks, and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Investments.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	The assessment of the fair value of certain of the debt securities (e.g. those containing an auction reset feature) can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these debt instruments.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements, we have classified our marketable investments as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we held municipal bonds with a fair value of $9.0 million ($11.0 million at par value) with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	The fair value of the ARS was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow approach, which is considered a Level 3 valuation.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates, based on data available at December 31, 2012, of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change, which may lead us in the future to record additional losses for these securities.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	We classified these ARS as available-for-sale securities and determined that the losses were not considered other-than-temporary and were not due to credit losses.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	Accordingly, changes in the market value of the ARS have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	If market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) or impairment charges within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	We may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	At December 31, 2012, we held $167.0 million of marketable investments that were valued using Level 2 inputs.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S7	Level 2 investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, by our investment managers utilizing third party pricing services, which consists of one price per instrument.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S8	We do not obtain pricing or quotes from brokers directly and historically we have not adjusted prices obtained from our investment managers for our non-ARS portfolio.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S9	We verify the pricing information obtained from our investment managers by obtaining an understanding of the pricing methodology and inputs utilized by the pricing services to value our particular investments, as well as an understanding of the controls and procedures utilized by our investment managers to both ensure the accurate recording and to validate the pricing of our investments obtained from the pricing services on an annual basis.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S10	Our marketable investments consist solely of high credit quality corporate and municipal bonds with a weighted average credit rating AA and do not include difficult to value features.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S11	The majority of our marketable investments are in large corporate notes.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P41_S12	We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2012 included in this report differ from those included in our earnings release issued February 13, 2013 in that they reflect an additional $750,000 ($450,000 after tax) loss on investments related to one of our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	After the issuance of our earnings release we received updated financial results from one of our investment funds indicating an increase in unrealized investment losses for the fund as of December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	We record a portion of the fund s operating results, based on our ownership interest in the fund, as investment gains (losses) in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	This resulted in (1) a decrease in our net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 from the previously announced $4.7 million to $4.3 million and a corresponding decrease in diluted and basic income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 from the previously announced $0.21 to $0.19, and (2) a decrease in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 from the previously announced $26.0 million to $25.6 million and a corresponding decrease in diluted and basic income per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 from the previously announced $1.13 to $1.12 and from $1.16 to $1.14, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	This charge did not result in a change in our pro forma income from operations or pro forma diluted income per share as reported in our earnings release as we exclude investment gains and losses from pro forma results.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	compared to 2011 Revenues The 3% increase in revenues during 2012 as compared to 2011 was driven by a 6% increase in research services revenue while advisory services and other revenue decreased by 2%.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Foreign exchange fluctuations from the prior year had the effect of reducing revenue growth by approximately 1% while the effect of the Springboard Research acquisition in May 2011 had an insignificant impact on revenue growth in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Revenues from customers outside the U.S. in 2012 compared to the prior year declined by 2% as a percent of total revenues due to both the effect of foreign currency rates and to a decline in revenue from the European region.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The general economic conditions in Europe have contributed to a difficult selling environment in that region.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Revenue growth trended downward during the second half of 2012 as compared to the first half of 2012, reflecting a trend downward in the year-over year growth in contract bookings during this period.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Accordingly, we expect a continued downward trend in year-over-year research services revenue growth in the first half of 2013.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	Revenue from advisory services and other decreased 2% during 2012 due to a $0.4 million decrease in event revenues and a $1.7 million decline in advisory and consulting revenue as compared to the prior year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	The decline in event revenue resulted principally from the smaller scope of events in 2012 as compared to the prior year which led to lower event ticket revenue in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	We count co-located events, which enable our clients to attend multiple events with one event ticket, as a single event in the tables above.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The decline in advisory and consulting revenue was due primarily to lower productivity during the year and to higher attrition of research analysts in 2012 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and direct margin results by segment.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment expenses during 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of increased salary and benefit costs resulting from annual pay increases, higher incentive bonuses and a full year of the Springboard Research employee costs from the May 2011 acquisition.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Average headcount during 2012 was essentially flat with 2011 levels.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	credit to expense in the 2011 period resulting from a change in estimate for the amount of performance-based RSUs that would vest.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses were essentially flat in 2012 compared to the prior year resulting from a decrease in total compensation costs which were offset primarily by increased travel and entertainment costs resulting from an increase in the average number of employees in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	The decrease in compensation costs in 2012 resulted from lower sales commissions principally due to modifications to our sales commission plan in 2012 and lower than planned contract bookings.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	The decrease in commissions was partially offset by an increase in incentive bonuses and salary and benefits resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Subject to the business environment, we intend to expand our sales force by approximately 10% in 2013 as compared to 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	Increased sales of our research services are generally recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in professional services costs of approximately $2.6 million principally related to information technology projects, including our updated website and new customer relationship management software and an increase in salary and benefit costs of approximately $1.6 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	The increase in salary and benefits costs in 2012 was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of salary costs capitalized in 2012 as compared to 2011 principally for the Company s website in the amount of $1.2 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	These increases were partially offset by a reduction in travel and entertainment costs in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	Depreciation Depreciation expense increased by $3.6 million during 2012 compared to the prior year primarily due to the initiation of depreciation for our new corporate headquarters in August 2011 and our new website in March 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P53_S6	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense has remained essentially consistent during 2012 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	In the first quarter of 2012 we realigned our sales force to simplify the selling process to our customers.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	that termination was considered probable at December 31, 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	We incurred an additional $1.4 million of severance and related costs during 2012 for the termination of 17 additional employees related to the sales reorganization and other cost reduction initiatives.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Essentially all of the termination costs were paid during 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P55_S3	In February 2013 the Company announced a reduction of approximately 30 jobs or 2.5% of its workforce worldwide to streamline its operations.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P55_S4	The Company anticipates incurring approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million of severance and related benefit costs in the first quarter of 2013 related to the reduction.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P55_S5	Other Income, Net Other income, net, increased by $0.7 million in 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses in 2012 as compared to the prior year, which was partially offset by lower interest income earned in 2012 from lower returns on our investments.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Gains (Losses) on Investments, Net Gains (losses) on investments primarily represent our share of equity method investment gains (losses) from our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	The decrease in gains of $1.5 million in 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily due to $0.8 million of losses recorded in 2012, of which $1.4 million of losses related to 2011 and $0.6 million of gains related to prior years.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	The additional losses for the 2011 period resulted from a lower valuation of certain investments in the funds from the valuations previously reported to us in 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S3	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2012 as compared to the prior year is principally due to the benefits recognized from the settlement of a tax audit during 2012 at one of our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in an approximate 20 percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate, principally from the ability to recognize net operating losses at this subsidiary.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S4	compared to 2010 Revenues The increase in total revenues in 2011 is principally the result of increased demand for our products and services and the acquisition of Springboard Research in May 2011, which accounted for approximately 1% of revenue growth.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S5	The effect of foreign exchange resulted in an approximate 1% increase in total revenues during 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P56_S6	Overall revenue growth was due in part to the growth in the economy and an increase in the number of sales personnel in 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	growth in the Asia Pacific region.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Including the effect of foreign exchange, revenue earned outside of the U.S. increased by 2% as a percent of total revenues in 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	We count co-located events, which enable our clients to attend multiple events with one event ticket, as a single event in the table above.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and direct margin results by segment.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment in dollars during 2011 is primarily the result of increased compensation and benefits principally due to an increase in research and fulfillment employees, increased facility costs, and increased travel and entertainment expense due in part to an all-employee meeting in the first quarter of 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	These increases were partially offset by a reduction of approximately $3.9 million of incentive compensation earned with respect to the third and fourth quarters of 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	Facility costs recorded in costs of services and fulfillment increased approximately $2.9 million during 2011 primarily due to us incurring lease costs for both our new corporate headquarters and our previous headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts and also due to a higher level of costs for our new corporate headquarters.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P59_S3	We recognized approximately eight months of lease costs in 2011 for our new headquarters during the construction period as we had access to the facility for construction purposes prior to our occupancy at the end of August 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P59_S4	Our lease at our prior headquarters expired on September 30, 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P59_S5	The decrease in cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues during 2011 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the reduction in the amount of incentive bonus earned with respect to the current year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2011 is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees and an increase in sales commissions.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Increased sales of our syndicated research services products are generally recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	The increase is also attributable to increased travel and entertainment expense and increased facility costs.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	Facility costs recorded in selling and marketing increased approximately $2.1 million during 2011 primarily due to us incurring duplicate lease costs as described above under cost of services and fulfillment .
1023313_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The decrease in general and administrative expense in dollars and as percentage of total revenue during 2011 is primarily due a reduction of approximately $1.6 million of incentive compensation earned with respect to the third and fourth quarters of 2011, the capitalization of approximately $1.6 million of internal information technology salary costs in 2011 for the build of our new client-facing website that was launched in 2012, and a decrease of approximately $0.6 million in stock compensation expense.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	These decreases were partially offset by an increase in facility costs, an increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in the number of general and administrative employees and salary increases during 2011, and acquisition and integration costs for Springboard Research of approximately $0.7 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Facility costs recorded in general and administrative expense increased approximately $0.8 million during 2011 primarily due to us incurring duplicate lease costs as described above under cost of services and fulfillment .
1023313_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	The increase of $1.7 million in depreciation expense during 2011 is primarily due to the initiation of depreciation for our new corporate headquarters in August 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	Amortization of Intangible Assets The decrease of $1.1 million in amortization expense during 2011 is primarily due to certain intangible assets from the acquisition of Strategic Oxygen in December 2009 becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of 2011, partially offset by an increase in amortization from the acquisition of Springboard Research in May 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	In the first quarter of 2012 we realigned our sales force to simplify the selling process to our customers.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	The $0.4 million of reorganization costs incurred in 2011 consist of severance and related benefits for three employees located outside of the U.S. based on statutory termination benefits in their country of employment and the fact that termination was considered probable at December 31, 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	Other Income, Net The decrease of $0.6 million in other income, net during 2011 is primarily due to lower interest income from lower returns on our investments.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Gains (Losses) on Investments, Net Gains (losses) on investments primarily represent our share of equity method investment gains (losses) from our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	The decrease of $1.3 million in gains during 2011 is primarily due to a smaller increase in the valuations of certain assets within the funds in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	Subsequent to 2011 we received information from the funds that reduced the value of the funds as of December 31, 2011 by $1.4 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	The $1.4 million investment loss was due to a reduction in the value of certain investments within the funds and was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the year ended December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	The effective tax rate has remained relatively consistent from 2010 to 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	We are organized into two client groups with each client group responsible for writing relevant research for the roles within the client organization on a worldwide basis.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The two client groups, which are considered operating segments, are: Business Technology ( BT ) and Marketing and Strategy ( M S ).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	In addition, our Events segment supports both client groups.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	Each client group generates revenue through sales of research, advisory and other service offerings targeted at specific roles within their targeted clients.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	Each client group consists of research personnel focused primarily on issues relevant to particular roles and to the day-to-day responsibilities of persons within the roles.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Amounts included in the Events segment relate to the operations of the events production department.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Revenue reported in the Events segment consists primarily of sponsorships and sales of event tickets to Forrester events.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	In the second quarter of 2012, we modified our management structure by consolidating our former Technology Industry client group segment into our two remaining client groups: Business Technology and Marketing and Strategy.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, we modified our calculation of segment direct margin to exclude certain marketing costs and Springboard Research integration costs and to include certain business development costs.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	Accordingly, the 2011 and 2010 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	We evaluate reportable segment performance based on direct margin.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Direct margin, as presented below, is defined as operating income excluding sales expenses, certain marketing and fulfillment expenses, stock-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses, depreciation expense, and amortization of intangibles.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	BT revenue increased 3% and 7% during 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Research services revenues increased 4% and 11%, respectively, for each of the years compared to the prior years while advisory services and other decreased 1% and increased 1%, respectively, for each of the years compared to the prior years.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	2011 is primarily due to a decrease in contract bookings growth in 2012 compared to 2011 due in part to the sales reorganization and sales employee attrition in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The decrease in direct margin percentage for the 2012 and 2011 periods compared to the prior years is primarily due to increased costs from the Springboard Research acquisition in May 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	M S revenue increased 5% and 21% during 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S3	Research services revenues increased 8% and 19%, respectively, for each of the years compared to the prior years while advisory services and other decreased 3% and increased 27%, respectively, for each of the years compared to the prior years.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S4	The decrease in the research services revenue growth rate in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in contract bookings growth in 2012 compared to 2011 due in part to the sales reorganization and sales employee attrition in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S5	The decrease in advisory services and other revenue growth rate in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in contract bookings growth in 2012 compared to 2011 and attrition of the analysts that perform advisory services in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S6	Events revenue decreased 3% and increased 18% during 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S7	During 2012 we repositioned our events to more closely align with our roles resulting in an increased number of smaller, co-located role-based events in comparison to larger combined events in the prior year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P72_S8	Co-located events enable our clients to attend multiple events with one event ticket and are considered as a single event.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	The decrease in revenue during 2012 is primarily due to the smaller scope of events held in 2012 as compared to the prior year, resulting in less event ticket revenue.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The decrease in direct margin percentage during 2012 is primarily due to lower event ticket revenue compared to the prior year.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	The increase in revenue during 2011 was due in part to one additional event held in 2011 compared to 2010 and to a strengthening economy in 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	Memberships for research services, which constituted approximately 69% of our revenues during 2012, are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $53.1 million, $55.4 million and $38.7 million during 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	The $2.3 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to a reduction in income before taxes of $7.1 million in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in non-cash expenses in 2012 including depreciation, amortization, gains/losses on investments, and stock compensation.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S4	The increase in cash provided from operations in 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily attributable to both a reduction in the amount of income taxes paid during 2011 of $10.7 million primarily due to a deferral of payments in 2011 and excess payments made in 2010, and an increase in net income of $2.5 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S5	During 2012, we used $4.1 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily $5.1 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $0.9 million reduction in restricted cash.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S6	Property and equipment purchases during 2012 consisted primarily of software and leasehold improvements.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S7	During 2011 we used $53.0 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $20.8 million of net purchases of marketable investments, $39.8 million of purchases of property and equipment and $7.5 million for acquisitions.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S8	The property and equipment purchases were partially funded by $14.5 million of restricted cash that had been placed in escrow in 2009 for such purchases.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S9	Property and equipment purchases during 2011 consisted primarily of leasehold improvements for new facilities and also included purchases of software and computer equipment.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S10	We used $31.7 million of cash from financing activities during 2012 resulting from $29.8 million of purchases of our common stock, $12.6 million of regular quarterly dividend payments and $0.9 million of deferred payments from our 2011 acquisition of Springboard Research.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S11	In addition, we realized $11.2 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan in 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S12	We used $6.3 million of cash from financing activities during 2011 resulting from $18.4 million of purchases of our common stock, partially offset by $11.6 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S13	In each of October 2012 and February 2013, our board of directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by $50 million, bringing the total remaining stock purchase authorization to approximately $150 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P74_S14	On February 13, 2013, we announced our intention to hire an investment banker to assist us in exploring means to accelerate our stock repurchase program and also announced an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we held $9.0 million ($11.0 million at par value) of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and have continued to fail throughout 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	As a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S3	Based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources, we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity with our ARS investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $98.8 million and marketable investments of $143.8 million.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S5	Cash balances held at our foreign subsidiaries were $28.1 million at December 31, 2012, of which $5.2 million represents undistributed earnings that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S6	We do not have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S7	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, including an acceleration of purchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P75_S8	As of December 31, 2012, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2012, we held approximately $9.0 million ($11.0 million at par value) of municipal notes with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	In February 2008, auctions for these securities began to fail and continued to fail throughout 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	These ARS may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions and have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result, our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or may not exist.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	If the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS, based on data available at December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	The assumptions used in valuing these ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change, which could result in significant changes to the fair value of these ARS.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	ARS are shown based upon their contractual maturity dates that range from 2024 to 2034.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Principal amounts by maturity dates in U.S. dollars (dollars in thousands): Foreign Currency Exchange.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P10_S3	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $0.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements.
1023313_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro or other foreign currencies.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of stockholders equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the design and operation of controls over advisory services and consulting revenue existed as of that date.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	The material weakness referred to above is described within Item 9A under Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting which appears on page 31 of the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the December 31, 2012 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management s report referred to above.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S7	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S8	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S9	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S10	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S11	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P0_S12	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P7_S0	Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P7_S1	Forrester s products and services are targeted to specific roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and information technology principally at $1 billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P7_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P7_S3	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P8_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P8_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P9_S3	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Company s investments with an auction reset feature and for which the Company does not have the ability to sell within one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company s investments are composed of securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes some of which contain an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities or ARS ), corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P12_S2	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P13_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P19_S2	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P19_S3	Impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	Non-Current Liabilities The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as non-current liabilities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $6.9 million and $6.7 million, respectively, and primarily results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Company s facility leases.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	The functional currency of the majority of Forrester s wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currency.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	These subsidiary financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	Gains and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P22_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Forrester recorded $0.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.4 million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P22_S4	In addition, Forrester s German holding companies, for which the functional currency was the U.S. dollar, recognized $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million of remeasurement gains on its deferred tax liability in income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P22_S5	Effective July 7, 2012 the Company s German holding companies were merged with the Company s German operating company creating one German entity for which the functional currency is the Euro.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2011 the Company adopted Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13) for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	ASU 2009-13 updates the previous multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	Issue 00-21 by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Forrester generates revenues from licensing research (including our data products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Forrester executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products and services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company obtains the selling prices of its products and services based on an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues, which are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P29_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P29_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Contracts for RoleView research entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January 1, 2011 are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	Contracts for RoleView research entered into or significantly modified after January 1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period, based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of determining selling price as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in this case.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each of these elements based upon their relative selling prices, which is based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	For all contracts entered into through January 2013, clients were offered a service guarantee, which gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	As of February 1, 2013 the Company discontinued its policy of offering all clients a service guarantee.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee, which generally equals the vesting period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	Cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock-based awards are classified as financing cash flows.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company is required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	The Company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S5	In addition, for performance-vested restricted stock units, the Company makes estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S6	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P33_S7	Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the following expense categories (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	The options granted under the equity incentive plans and shares subject to the employee stock purchase plan were valued utilizing the Black Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values:
1023313_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The dividend yield of zero for periods prior to 2012 is based on the fact that Forrester had never paid cash dividends until the board of directors approved a special dividend of $3.00 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	The dividend yield in 2012 is based on the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend program approved by the board of directors in February 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forrester s common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	The risk-free interest rate used is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the award s expected term.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P36_S3	The expected term calculation is based upon Forrester s historical experience of exercise patterns.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of December 31, 2012 was $9.0 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 1.9 years.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment terms.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Forrester provides for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, computed using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives of assets as follows:
1023313_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Forrester provides for amortization of intangible assets, computed using an accelerated method according to the expected cash flows to be received from the underlying assets, over the respective lives as follows:
1023313_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Income Taxes Forrester recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Forrester s provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P43_S3	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P43_S4	The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P43_S5	The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	The weighted average number of common equivalent shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury-stock method.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Basic and diluted weighted average common shares are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, options to purchase approximately 0.8 million, 0.3 million and 0.4 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the diluted weighted average common share calculation as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	This newly issued accounting standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	Under that option, an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	This ASU is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P47_S4	As the Company does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2012 other than goodwill, the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2013 will not have an impact on the Company s consolidated results.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	(2) Acquisitions Springboard Research On May 12, 2011, Forrester acquired Springboard Research ( Springboard ), a provider of research and advisory services focused on Asia Pacific and emerging markets.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	Springboard was a former division of Knowledge Platform, Inc.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	The acquisition of the Springboard business further supports Forrester s role-based strategy and expands Forrester s coverage in the Asia Pacific region.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	The total purchase price was approximately $9.0 million, of which approximately $6.7 million was paid on the acquisition date and $2.3 million (the Holdback ) is payable at various times through June 1, 2013, subject to possible reduction to satisfy indemnification claims.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S4	Of the $2.3 million Holdback, up to $0.9 million was contingent on the retention of certain employees for a period of time and on the extension of a certain lease.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S5	As of May 2012 the two referenced contingency provisions had elapsed with the full amount payable to Knowledge Platform.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S6	As of December 31, 2012, $1.4 million of the Holdback had been paid by the Company and $0.9 million of the Holdback remains in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S7	The results of Springboard Research, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forrester s consolidated financial statements since May 12, 2011 in the Business Technology segment.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P48_S8	Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Approximately $2.1 million of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The Company believes the goodwill reflects its expectations of synergistic revenue opportunities from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Intangible assets are amortized according to the expected cash flows to be received.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	The following are the identifiable intangible assets acquired and their respective weighted average lives (dollars in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	(3) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets A summary of the goodwill by segment and the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the Business Technology ( BT ), Marketing and Strategy ( M S ), and Events segments is shown in the following table (in thousands).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	In the second quarter of 2012 the Company modified its management structure by consolidating its former Technology Industry ( TI ) client group into its two remaining client groups: BT and M S.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	The goodwill previously allocated to the TI segment was reassigned to the BT and M S segments based on the relative fair value of the elements transferred from TI to each of BT and M S.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no accumulated goodwill impairment losses.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	A summary of Forrester s intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately $2.4 million, $2.6 million and $3.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Estimated amortization expense related to intangible assets that will continue to be amortized is as follows (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	(4) Marketable Investments The following table summarizes the Company s marketable investments (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	The following table summarizes the maturity periods of the marketable securities in the Company s portfolio as of December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	In February 2008, certain ARS that Forrester held experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	These auction failures have continued throughout 2012 and based on current market conditions, it is likely that auction failures will continue.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	The following table reflects the ARS at their contractual maturity dates of between 2024 and 2034 (in thousands).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and market value of Forrester s available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporary, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company holds ARS with a fair value of $9.0 million and a par value of $11.0 million at December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	These ARS will continue to be held as available-for-sale and are classified as a long-term asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company intends to retain its investment in these ARS until the earlier of an anticipated recovery in market value or maturity and as a result has not recorded an other-than-temporary loss on these ARS.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Realized gains or losses on sales of the Company s federal obligations, state and municipal bonds and corporate bonds were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets (cash equivalents and marketable investments) measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	(1) Included in cash and cash equivalents.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Level 2 assets consist of the Company s entire portfolio of federal, state, municipal and corporate bonds, excluding those municipal bonds described below with an auction reset feature.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	Level 2 assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation methods, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P64_S3	These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Level 3 assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011 consist entirely of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (ARS).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Prior to 2008, the fair value of the ARS investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	While the Company continues to receive interest income on its ARS investments at each interest reset date (which occurs at either seven or 35 day intervals for each security), these investments trade infrequently and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	Interest rates on the securities ranged from 0.1% to 0.5% and 0.1% to 0.6% during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S4	The Company values the ARS using a discounted cash flow model that includes unobservable inputs including estimates of interest rates, discount rates and expected holding periods of the securities, which is considered a Level 3 valuation.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S5	Unobservable inputs included in the valuation as of December 31, 2012 include a weighted average interest rate of 0.9%, a weighted average discount rate of 3.9%, and a weighted average holding period of 8.7 years.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S6	The valuation resulted in an unrealized loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $2.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P65_S7	The Company believes that the loss is temporary due to the strong underlying credit rating of the securities and the fact that the Company does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	Significant increases or decreases in any of the valuation assumptions in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	(5) Non-Marketable Investments At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying value of the Company s non-marketable investments, which were composed primarily of interests in technology-related private equity funds, were $6.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	One of the Company s investments, with a book value of $1.2 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is being accounted for using the cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments are limited partnerships and the Company has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, the Company records its share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded gains (losses) from its non-marketable investments of approximately $(0.4) million, $1.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively, which are included in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, gross distributions of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, were received from the funds.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	During 2012 and 2013, the Company identified errors related to the amount of income previously recorded for investments under the equity-method.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	Income related to equity method investments was understated by approximately $0.4 million in 2007, $0.2 million in 2008 and, based on revisions received by the Company in 2012 and 2013 to the information that was originally provided to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2011, was overstated by approximately $1.4 million in 2011.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	Management has concluded that these errors are immaterial to all prior period financial statements and recorded a correction of these errors as a $0.6 million and $0.2 million reduction in equity method income in the three months ended September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	In June 2010, the Company extended the expiration date of a cash bonus plan, originally adopted in 2000, that would pay a bonus, after the return of invested capital from certain of the Company s non-marketable investments, to certain key employees.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	To date, no bonuses have been paid under the plan and no amounts are accrued as of December 31, 2012 as payments under the plan were not considered probable.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	The plan will now automatically expire on June 30, 2013, subject to earlier expiration as provided in the plan in the event that prior to such date there are less than 10 participants in the plan or all of the Company s invested capital (as defined in the plan) has been returned to the Company.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	(6) Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 consists of the following (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The components of the income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to Forrester s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:
1023313_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Current net deferred tax assets and long-term net deferred tax assets were $0.1 and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2012 and $0 and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2011, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	Current net deferred tax liabilities and long-term net deferred tax liabilities were $0.4 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and $0.4 and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2011, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P76_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P76_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition and U.S. capital losses.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10.0 million obtained from acquired businesses.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S2	These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S3	If unused, these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019 through 2028.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S4	The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19.8 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S5	Approximately $5.7 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P77_S6	In the third quarter of 2012 the Company settled a tax audit at its German subsidiary resulting in the recognition of $5.5 million in deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and intangible assets at this subsidiary.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	2010 the Company had determined that the ability of the Company to benefit from the net operating losses at its German subsidiary did not meet the more likely than not standard.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	Accordingly, the previously recorded deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance for the German net operating loss were removed from the components of deferred taxes with no effect to the Company s overall tax provision for 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $1.9 million, of which $1.1 million expires in 2014, and $0.8 million expires in 2016.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P78_S3	The following table provides a summary of the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized approximately ($0.3) million, $0.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of net tax benefits (deficiencies) from tax deductions in excess of (or less than) book deductions resulting from employee stock option exercises.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	The net tax benefits (deficiencies) were recorded as an increase (decrease) to additional paid-in-capital.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized in the year that the deduction reduces the amount of cash payable for taxes.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	Undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $5.2 million as of December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P79_S4	The Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the business.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P79_S5	Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, the amount of taxes attributable to the undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company utilizes a two-step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	The second step determines the measurement of the tax position.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2012, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $1.7 million, all of which if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate in a future period.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	It is not expected that a significant amount of unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized within the next 12 months.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and such amounts were not material in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P81_S3	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S., state, local and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2005, except to the extent of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from those years.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	Major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	(7) Commitments As of December 31, 2012, Forrester had future contractual obligations as follows for operating leases (in thousands):
1023313_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Aggregate rent expenses, net of sublease income, were approximately $14.4 million, $15.3 million and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	(8) Stockholders Equity Preferred Stock Forrester has authorized 500,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Board of Directors has full authority to issue this stock and to fix the voting powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designation of such series.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	Treasury Stock Through December 31, 2012, Forrester s Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate $310.0 million, including $50.0 million approved in October 2012 and $60.0 million approved in October 2010, to purchase common stock under the stock repurchase program.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	The shares repurchased may be used, among other things, in connection with Forrester s equity incentive and purchase plans.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	As of December 31, 2012, Forrester had repurchased approximately 9.2 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $210.8 million.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company declared and paid four quarterly dividends of $0.14 per share each quarter, amounting to $0.56 per share or $12.6 million for the year.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	In December 2010 the Company paid a special cash dividend of $68.4 million, which represented a payment of $3.00 per share to common stockholders.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Equity Plans Forrester maintains the following four equity incentive plans: the Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan ), the Amended and Restated 1996 Equity Incentive Plan (the 1996 Plan ), the 2006 Stock Option Plan for Directors , as amended (the 2006 Directors Plan ) and the 1996 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the 1996 Directors Plan ).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	Upon approval of the 2006 Plan and the 2006 Directors Plan by stockholders, no future awards under the 1996 Plan and 1996 Directors Plan could be granted or issued.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	In addition, upon approval of an amendment to the 2006 Plan by stockholders in 2012, no future awards under the 2006 Directors Plan could be granted or issued.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The 2006 Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based awards, including incentive stock options ( ISOs ), non-qualified stock options ( NSOs ), and restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to purchase up to 4,350,000 shares authorized in the 2006 Plan plus up to 2,500,000 shares returned from the 1996 Plan and 80,000 shares returned from the 2006 Directors Plan.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	Under the terms of the 2006 Plan, ISOs may not be granted at less than fair market value on the date of grant (and in no event less than par value).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	Options generally vest annually over two to four years and expire after 10 years and RSUs generally vest over three to four years, in each case sometimes subject to performance conditions in addition to the passage of time.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P90_S3	Options and RSUs granted under the 2006 Plan immediately vest upon certain events, as described in the 2006 Plan.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P90_S4	As of December 31, 2012, approximately 2.5 million shares were available for future grant of awards under the 2006 Plan.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The 1996 Plan provided for the issuance of stock-based awards, including ISOs and NSOs, to purchase up to 13,500,000 shares of common stock.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P91_S1	Under the terms of the 1996 Plan, ISOs were not granted at less than fair market value on the date of grant (and in no event less than par value).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P91_S2	ISO grants to holders of 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of Forrester stock were required to be granted at an exercise price not less than 110% of the fair market value at the date of grant.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P91_S3	Options generally vested ratably over two to four years and expire after 10 years and were sometimes subject to performance conditions in addition to the passage of time.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P91_S4	At December 31, 2012, approximately 0.1 million options remain outstanding and are fully vested under the 1996 Plan.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	The 2006 Directors Plan provided for the issuance of options to purchase up to 450,000 shares of common stock.

1023313_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	The two client groups, which are considered operating segments, are: Business Technology ( BT ) and Marketing and Strategy ( M S ).
1023313_13_ITEM8_P105_S2	In addition, the Company s Events segment supports both client groups.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P105_S3	Each client group generates revenues through sales of research, advisory and other service offerings targeted at specific roles within their targeted clients.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P105_S4	Each client group consists of research personnel focused primarily on issues relevant to particular roles and to the day-to-day responsibilities of persons within the roles.

1023313_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	Forrester does not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
1023313_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources.

1023313_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2012 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P1_S6	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) of the Treadway Commission.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on its assessment, management identified the following control deficiency as of December 31, 2012 that constituted a material weakness: We did not maintain effective controls over revenue related to our advisory services and consulting projects.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Specifically, we did not design and operate effective controls to evidence that our advisory services and consulting projects were monitored for services performed in support of the revenue recognized.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Although the deficiency did not result in the identification of a material misstatement during 2012, this deficiency could have resulted in a misstatement to the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would be material and would not be prevented or detected.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Accordingly, management has determined that the deficiency described above constitutes a material weakness and that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Plans for Remediation of Material Weakness Our management has taken immediate action to begin remediating the material weakness identified.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	These remedial efforts, outlined below, are intended to address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall control environment.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Consulting Project Scoping: During the scoping phase of each project, we will ensure that evidence is maintained of the review and approval of the allocation of the project revenue to the services to be delivered to the client.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Advisory Services and Consulting Project Performance: Beginning in March 2013, our project managers will more closely monitor the performance of each advisory service and consulting project and will maintain evidence of their review and approval of the services performed.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We will ensure that we conduct proper training so that the remedial actions identified above are understood and followed.
1023313_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Turnpike Concord, MA 01742 Dear Charles: This letter acknowledges your separation from employment with Forrester Research, Inc.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	( Forrester or the Company ), and sets forth Forrester s agreement with you concerning this separation and the terms of your severance package.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	You have agreed to resign from your position as Chief Operating Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors of Forrester effective October 24, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S3	Your separation from employment with Forrester shall be effective as of November 15, 2012 (the Separation Date ).
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S4	Between now and the Separation Date, you shall be available as needed in order to assist in the orderly transition of your duties and to perform such other duties as may be reasonably directed by Forrester.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S5	On the Separation Date, Forrester will pay you an amount equal to any earned but previously unpaid base salary through such date, and payment for accrued but unused vacation, reduced by all appropriate withholdings.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S6	The payments set forth in this paragraph are not contingent upon your execution of this letter agreement.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S7	Subject to your eligibility to elect continuing group medical and dental insurance coverage in accordance with the federal law known as COBRA, your participation in Forrester s group medical and dental insurance plans shall terminate effective November 30, 2012, in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S8	Your participation in all other employee benefit plans and programs provided by Forrester shall terminate on the Separation Date in accordance with the terms of such plans and programs.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P66_S9	This letter does not alter the terms of any Company stock and stock option plans (such as the Company s Amended and Restated 1996 Equity Incentive Plan or Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan), or the terms of any previously awarded grants under such plans.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	Please be reminded of your continuing obligations pursuant to the Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights, and Noncompetition Agreement that you signed on June 18, 1998 (copy enclosed).
1023313_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	These obligations continue following the conclusion of your employment on November 15, 2012, and apply regardless of whether you execute this letter agreement.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	Further, in consideration of your fulfillment of your obligations set forth herein, and without admission of any wrongdoing or liability on the part of Forrester, you and Forrester agree as follows:
1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	1.

1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	These payments will be made in accordance with Forrester s regular payroll practices and will be subject to all applicable withholdings.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S2	These payments will begin as soon as administratively possible following the expiration of the revocation period set forth in paragraph 9, below.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S3	For the avoidance of doubt, the payment referenced in subsection (ii) may be used by you for any purpose, including, but not limited to, health care continuation coverage under COBRA.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S4	(b) You will be eligible to receive executive level outplacement services, up to a maximum amount of $30,000.00, through an entity of your choosing, subject to Forrester s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S5	The invoices for such services shall be sent directly to my attention at Forrester for payment.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S6	Forrester shall pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of Forrester s receipt of same.

1023313_13_ITEM15_P69_S8	You acknowledge and agree that the decision whether to award such benefits rests with the state unemployment board and that Forrester cannot guarantee your receipt of such benefits.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	Prior to your Separation Date, you shall return to Forrester all telephone cards, credit cards, building cards, keys, work papers, files and other documentation, laptop computer and other equipment, computer files and diskettes, and all other Forrester records and property, without retaining any copies or derivations thereof, except for your personnel and benefits documents.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	You have agreed to submit for reimbursement purposes all business expense reports and any necessary supporting documentation to Forrester by November 15, 2012.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	The severance pay set forth in paragraph 1 above will take into account a proper reconciliation of amounts due to you from Forrester and/or amounts due to Forrester from you.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	These reconciliation adjustments may include, but are not limited to, outstanding travel advances or expenses, overdue American Express bills, unreturned Company-owned equipment, and outstanding expense reports.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P71_S3	For the avoidance of doubt, in the event these obligations to Forrester have not been previously satisfied, Forrester will offset them against any severance compensation payable hereunder.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	In consideration of the undertakings described herein, including the severance compensation which Forrester has agreed to pay you hereunder, and to which you would not otherwise be entitled, you, on behalf of yourself and your representatives, assigns, executors, administrators, and heirs, hereby completely release and forever discharge Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and all of their respective shareholders (but only in their capacity as shareholders), officers, and all other representatives, agents, directors, employees, employee benefit plans, successors, and assigns, both individually and in their official capacities, from all claims, rights, demands, actions, obligations, and causes of action, of every kind, nature, and character, known or unknown, which you now have, may now have, or have ever had, against them until the date you execute this letter agreement arising from or in any way connected with your employment relationship with Forrester Research, Inc., any actions during the relationship, and/or the termination of such relationship.

1023313_13_ITEM15_P73_S5	Any material breach of this letter agreement or the Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights, and Noncompetition Agreement, will be grounds for immediate termination and/or disgorgement of any of the pay and benefits provided to you hereunder.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P73_S6	You further agree to cooperate with Forrester and to make yourself available to Forrester upon Forrester s reasonable request, both before and after the Separation Date, in order to assist Forrester in: a) the defense of any pending or future legal claims as to which you may have relevant information; and b) the execution of any administrative or regulatory filings and related documentation, including as needed in order to effectuate your resignation or removal as a director, officer, or authorized signatory for any corporate group entity.
1023313_13_ITEM15_P73_S7	You acknowledge and agree that you will not receive any additional compensation for such cooperation.

1023313_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	Any term or provision of this letter agreement that is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this letter agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this letter agreement in any other jurisdiction; and any such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified by such court so that it is enforceable to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

1023313_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	These risks and uncertainties include: A Decline in Renewals for Our Membership-Based Research Services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our research products and services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Business may be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If conditions in the United States and global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our research and advisory services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We have clients in approximately 55 countries and approximately 26% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients sourced by the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research analysts, consultants, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our future success will also depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research to meet the changing information needs of our clients.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We compete in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We may also face increased competition from Internet-based research firms.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, information-gathering, and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies, survey-based general market research firms and general business consulting firms.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Trends in technology and research and advisory services spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our research services from clients.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The hiring and training of new analysts, consultants, and sales personnel.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Changes in demand for our research and advisory services.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Any Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As disclosed in Item 9A of this report, we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because we did not maintain effective controls over revenue related to our advisory services and consulting projects and over revenue related to the event tickets that are included in certain of our subscription products.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our remediation activities related to these material weaknesses.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	As a result, as of December 31, 2013, we concluded that we have remediated these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	There can be no assurance that no weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will occur in future periods, or that any such weakness will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	facility accommodates research, marketing, sales, consulting, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Paris, New Delhi, and Singapore.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our San Francisco lease is for approximately 19,000 square feet, with a 63-month term that expires June 30, 2016.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our New York lease is for approximately 15,200 square feet, with an initial term of approximately ten years until January 31, 2021, with the right to terminate in 2017 with prior notice and payment of designated early termination fees and charges.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term of eleven years until September 24, 2021.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR .
1023313_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	During 2012 quarterly dividends of $0.14 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	During 2013 quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	In February 2014 our Board of Directors declared an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share that is payable on March 19, 2014.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 6, 2014 there were approximately 36 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 6, 2014 the closing price of our common stock was $37.70 per share.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	The following table represents the ranges of high and low sale prices of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012: Through 2013, our Board of Directors authorized an aggregate $385.0 million to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program including $25.0 million authorized in July 2013 and $50.0 million authorized in February 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2013 we had repurchased approximately 12.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $329.1 million.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S4	During 2013 the Company retired 11.7 million shares of treasury stock.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S5	These retired shares are now included in the Company s pool of authorized but unissued shares.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P1_S6	The retired stock had a carrying value of approximately $303.0 million.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2013 we repurchased the following shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program:
1023313_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) All purchases of our common stock were made under the stock repurchase program first announced in 2001.
1023313_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2013 with the cumulative return during the same period for the Russell 2000 and the S P 600 Small Cap Information Technology Index, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were reinvested.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	The 2013 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes a $1.9 million loss for the sale of the Company s entire portfolio of auction rate securities.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	The 2012 net income amount includes a $5.9 million deferred income tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a tax audit at the Company s German subsidiary.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	The 2009 income from operations amount includes a $5.4 million reorganization charge for facility consolidations and a reduction-in-force of approximately 50 employees.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	As described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company identified prior period errors that affected the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were revised as follows:
1023313_14_ITEM6_P6_S0	The 2010 consolidated statement of income has been revised to reflect a $0.1 million increase to revenue, a $0.1 million increase to income from operations, a $0.2 million decrease to income tax provision, and a $0.3 million increase to net income.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P7_S0	The 2009 consolidated statement of income has been revised to reflect a $0.8 million increase in loss on investments, a $0.7 million decrease to income tax provision, and a $0.1 million decrease to net income.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P8_S0	The 2011 consolidated balance sheet data was revised to increase working capital by $0.3 million, decrease total assets by $0.5 million, increase deferred revenue by $0.1 million, and increase total liabilities by $0.1 million.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P9_S0	The 2010 consolidated balance sheet data was revised to decrease working capital by $0.1 million, decrease deferred revenue by $0.2 million, and decrease total liabilities by $0.2 million.
1023313_14_ITEM6_P10_S0	The 2009 consolidated balance sheet data was revised to decrease working capital by $0.5 million, increase total assets by $0.1 million, and decrease total liabilities by less than $0.1 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to our research and data products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting events.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our research.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S7	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P0_S8	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research and consulting personnel and all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities and annual fees for cloud-based information technology systems are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention, enrichment and number of clients are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Clients we count as a single client the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent and we also aggregate separate instrumentalities of the federal, state, and provincial governments as single clients.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 both increased 2% compared to the prior years.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	However when including the amount of future invoicing for contracts at each period end, the combined amount of deferred revenue and future invoicing was flat at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 compared to the prior years.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	The change in deferred revenue plus future invoicing is essentially consistent with the change in agreement value at December 31, 2013 and 2012 compared to the prior years and both metrics are reflective of flat contract bookings in both 2013 and 2012 compared to prior years.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	Enrichment, client retention and dollar retention rates at December 31, 2013 have all trended downward from 2011 levels.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	The enrichment and client retention rates include a 12-month period and as such the rates in 2013 and 2012 reflect the negative effects from the challenges associated with the implementation of the sales reorganization in early 2012, high sales employee attrition during 2013 and 2012, a difficult selling environment in Europe during 2013 and 2012 and weaker demand for our data subscription products in 2013, in part due to the phasing out of our standalone Technology Marketing Navigator data product.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Effective January 1, 2011 we adopted Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13).
1023313_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	ASU 2009-13 updates the previous multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	Issue 00-21 by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research (including our data subscription products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the discount is applied ratably to the research and data products only (which commence delivery on the first day of the contract), as the undelivered products in the contract (advisory services or events) would be refundable to the customer at list price if not delivered.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We obtain the selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Research services revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P21_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P21_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Contracts for RoleView research entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January 1, 2011, were accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	significantly modified after January 1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of determining selling prices as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in our case.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	Beginning in February 2013, we discontinued our policy of offering our clients a service guarantee.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Service guarantees had provided our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P24_S3	Furthermore, our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P24_S4	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, dividend yields and forfeiture rates.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Expected dividend yields are based on expectations of current and future dividends, if any.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	We are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	In addition, for our performance-vested restricted stock units, we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S5	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S6	If our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimates, or if our estimates of forfeitures or performance outcomes are modified in a future period, the actual stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P27_S7	For example, during 2011 we modified our estimates of the performance outcome for RSUs issued during 2009 and 2010 that resulted in a credit of $0.9 million being recorded in 2011 related to expense recognized in prior periods related to these RSUs.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $5.7 million at December 31, 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had $85.8 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P32_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The annual assessment of goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment, or a combination of both.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2013 utilizing a qualitative assessment and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units more likely than not continues to exceed their respective carrying values.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships and technology and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P38_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P38_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P38_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Investments.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements, we have classified our marketable investments as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	At December 31, 2013, we held $87.3 million of marketable investments that were valued using Level 2 inputs.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Our marketable investments consist solely of high credit quality corporate and municipal bonds with a weighted average credit rating of AA and do not include difficult to value features.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	The majority of our marketable investments are in large corporate notes.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S4	Level 2 investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, by our investment managers utilizing third party pricing services, which consists of one price per instrument.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S5	We do not obtain pricing or quotes from brokers directly and historically we have not adjusted prices obtained from our investment managers.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P41_S6	We verify the pricing information obtained from our investment managers by periodically repricing the securities from independent sources, obtaining an understanding of the pricing methodology and inputs utilized by the pricing services to value our particular investments, as well as an understanding of the controls and procedures utilized by our investment managers to both ensure the accurate recording and to validate the pricing of our investments obtained from the pricing services on an annual basis.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	At December 31, 2013 we held no marketable investments that were valued using Level 3 inputs.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Regardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are recorded within gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 The financial results for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included in this report differ from those included in our earnings release issued February 12, 2014 in that the earnings release did not reflect the revision of our prior period financial statements for errors in income taxes that we identified subsequent to the issuance of our earnings release.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	As described in Notes 2 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have revised our prior period financial statements to reflect the correction of the errors in the applicable prior periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	The effect of the revision on the previously reported amounts in our earnings release was (1) an increase in net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2013 of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $0.01 and (2) an increase (decrease) in net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2012 of $(0.1) million and $0.3 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012 of $0.02.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	This change did not affect our pro forma net income or pro forma earnings per share as reported in our earnings release as we utilized a fixed 39% tax rate for pro forma purposes in both the 2013 and 2012 periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	2013 compared to 2012 Revenues As described in the overview section above, the agreement value at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was essentially flat compared to the prior years and is reflective of flat contract bookings in both 2013 and 2012 compared to prior years.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Enrichment, client retention and dollar retention rates at December 31, 2013 have all trended downward from 2011 levels.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The enrichment and client retention rates include a 12-month period and as such the rates in 2013 and 2012 reflect the negative effects from the challenges associated with the implementation of the sales reorganization in early 2012, high sales employee attrition during 2013 and 2012, a difficult selling environment in Europe during 2013 and 2012 and weaker demand for our data subscription products in 2013, in part due to the phasing out of our standalone Technology Marketing Navigator data product.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	The 2% increase in revenues during 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by a 5% increase in advisory services and other revenues while research services revenues were essentially flat during the period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	Foreign exchange fluctuations had an insignificant effect on revenue growth during 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. in 2013 declined by 2% as a percentage of total revenues compared to the prior year period due primarily to a decline in revenues from the European region.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P47_S6	The general economic conditions in Europe as well as sales leadership challenges have contributed to a difficult selling environment in that region.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue primarily on a ratable basis over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Research services revenues were flat during 2013 compared to the prior year as contract bookings during those periods were essentially flat.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Revenues from our data subscription products declined by approximately $2.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the phasing out of our standalone Tech Marketing Navigator data product in 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	The decline in data subscription revenues was partially offset by an increase in research product revenue.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	Revenues from advisory services and other increased 5% during 2013 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S5	The increase during 2013 is due entirely to increased advisory and project consulting revenues, as event revenues were flat in 2013 compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S6	The increase in advisory and project consulting revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012 was generated in the second half of 2013 and was due primarily to both an increase in consulting headcount as we began to build out a dedicated consulting organization in 2013 as well as to increased productivity of our analyst personnel.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P48_S7	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and direct margin results by segment.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment expenses during 2013 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in compensation costs resulting primarily from an increase in the number of employees, an increase in incentive bonus payments and annual merit increases.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition, 2013 included an increase in facility costs due to new office space in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of 2012 and an increase in service fees for cloud-based information systems.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees related to the amount of surveys performed and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	We hired additional consulting employees in 2013 in support of our decision to build a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to our clients, allowing our analysts to spend additional timing on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P49_S4	We anticipate cost of services and fulfillment to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2014 as we plan to accelerate the pace of hiring in 2014 compared to 2013 with additional consulting personnel and product specialists.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Selling and Marketing The increase in selling and marketing expenses during 2013 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $5.2 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from both an increase in sales and marketing employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, 2013 included an increase in facility costs due to new office space in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of 2012 and an increase in service fees for cloud-based information systems.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Subject to the business environment, we intend to expand our quota carrying sales force by approximately 5% to 7% in 2014 as compared to 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	Any resulting increase in contract bookings for our research services would generally be recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2013 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in compensation and benefits costs due to an increase in incentive bonus payments and annual merit increases.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	In addition, 2013 included an increase in recruiting costs to support company-wide hiring in 2013 as well as an increase in facility costs due to new office space in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of 2012 and an increase in service fees for cloud-based information systems.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees primarily related to a decrease in information technology projects as 2012 included an update to our website and implementation of new customer relationship management software.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $0.3 million during 2013 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from the initiation of depreciation for our new website in March 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense has remained essentially consistent during 2013 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	Reorganization Costs During 2013 we incurred $1.9 million of severance and related costs for the elimination of 31 jobs or approximately 2.5% of our workforce worldwide to streamline our operations.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S6	Essentially all costs incurred for the reorganization were paid during 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S7	We incurred $1.4 million of severance and related costs during 2012 for the termination of 17 employees related to the sales reorganization and other cost reduction initiatives.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S8	Essentially all of these costs were paid during 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S9	Income from Operations Income from operations declined $8.9 million during 2013 as compared to the prior year and declined to 7.3% of total revenues in 2013 from 10.5% in the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S10	The decrease in both dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2013 is due primarily to low revenue growth in 2013 combined with increased compensation costs in 2013 from additional headcount investments in our consulting and sales organizations and annual merit increases.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P51_S11	We anticipate a small contraction in income from operations as a percentage of total revenues in 2014 as compared to 2013 as we plan to continue to invest in consulting and sales headcount in 2014.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our marketable securities as well as gains (losses) on foreign currency.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	The decrease in other income, net during 2013 is primarily due to lower interest income earned in 2013 due to lower investment balances.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Gains (Losses) on Investments, Net Gains (losses) on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains (losses) from our technology-related investment funds and gains (losses) from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	On October 30, 2013 we sold our portfolio of auction rate securities (par value $11.0 million) for a realized loss of $1.9 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	In addition, in 2013 we realized an approximate $0.7 million loss from our equity method investments primarily from a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	During 2012 the valuation of the assets within these funds remained essentially consistent with the 2011 valuations.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	Gains (losses) from the sale of marketable securities were insignificant in 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate during 2013 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the inclusion in 2012 of a tax benefit from the settlement of a tax audit by our German subsidiary that resulted in a 21 percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate, and to higher non-deductible expenses in 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	This increase in the rate in 2013 was partially offset by an increase in the benefit of the foreign tax rate differential on non-U.S earnings due to higher foreign earnings, foreign tax credits realized in 2013 and a lower state rate in 2013 due to changes in income apportionment in 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	The 3% increase in revenues during 2012 as compared to 2011 was driven by a 6% increase in research services revenues while advisory services and other revenues decreased by 2%.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	Foreign exchange fluctuations from the prior year had the effect of reducing revenue growth by approximately 1% while the effect of the Springboard Research acquisition in May 2011 had an insignificant impact on revenue growth in 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	Revenues from customers outside the U.S. in 2012 compared to the prior year declined by 2% as a percent of total revenues due to both the effect of foreign currency rates and to a decline in revenue from the European region.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The general economic conditions in Europe contributed to a difficult selling environment in that region.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Revenue growth trended downward during the second half of 2012 as compared to the first half of 2012, reflecting a trend downward in the year-over year growth in contract bookings during this period.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	Revenues from advisory services and other decreased 2% during 2012 due to a $0.4 million decrease in event revenues and a $1.5 million decline in advisory and consulting revenues as compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	The decline in event revenues resulted principally from the smaller scope of events in 2012 as compared to the prior year which led to lower event ticket revenue in 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	We count co-located events, which enable our clients to attend multiple events with one event ticket, as a single event in the tables above.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	The decline in advisory and consulting revenues was due primarily to lower productivity during the year and to higher attrition of research analysts in 2012 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and direct margin results by segment.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment expenses during 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of increased compensation and benefit costs resulting from annual merit increases, higher incentive bonuses and a full year of the Springboard Research employee costs from the May 2011 acquisition.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Average headcount during 2012 was essentially flat with 2011 levels.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, 2012 included increased professional services fees in support of consulting revenue and an increase of $1.4 million of stock compensation costs resulting from a credit to expense in the 2011 period resulting from a change in estimate for the amount of performance-based RSUs that would vest.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Selling and marketing expenses were essentially flat in 2012 compared to the prior year resulting from a decrease in total compensation costs which were offset primarily by increased travel and entertainment costs resulting from an increase in the average number of employees in 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The decrease in compensation costs in 2012 resulted from lower sales commissions principally due to modifications to our sales commission plan in 2012 and lower than planned contract bookings.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	The decrease in commissions was partially offset by an increase in incentive bonuses and salary and benefits resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in professional services costs of approximately $2.6 million principally related to information technology projects, including our updated website and new customer relationship management software and an increase in compensation and benefit costs of approximately $1.6 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase in compensation and benefits costs in 2012 was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of compensation costs capitalized in 2012 as compared to 2011 principally for the Company s website in the amount of $1.2 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	These increases were partially offset by a reduction in travel and entertainment costs in 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Depreciation Depreciation expense increased by $3.6 million during 2012 compared to the prior year primarily due to the initiation of depreciation for our new corporate headquarters in August 2011 and our new website in March 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense has remained essentially consistent during 2012 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	In the first quarter of 2012 we realigned our sales force to simplify the selling process to our customers.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	We incurred approximately $0.4 million of severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 for three sales employees located outside of the U.S. based on statutory termination benefits in their country of employment and the fact that termination was considered probable at December 31, 2011.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	We incurred an additional $1.4 million of severance and related costs during 2012 for the termination of 17 additional employees related to the sales reorganization and other cost reduction initiatives.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	Essentially all of the termination costs were paid during 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	Income from Operations Income from operations declined $6.0 million during 2012 as compared to the prior year and declined to 10.5% of total revenues in 2012 from 13.0% in the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S5	The decrease in both dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2012 is due primarily to low revenue growth in 2012 combined with increased compensation costs in 2012 from annual merit increases, increased incentive bonus and a full year of Springboard Research costs in 2012; increased depreciation costs from the initiation of depreciation for our new corporate headquarters and our new website; and increased professional services costs and stock compensation costs in 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P64_S6	Other Income, Net Other income, net, increased by $0.7 million in 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses in 2012 as compared to the prior year, which was partially offset by lower interest income earned in 2012 from lower returns on our investments.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Gains (Losses) on Investments, Net Gains (losses) on investments in 2012 and 2011 primarily represent our share of equity method investment gains (losses) from our technology-related investment funds.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	The losses during 2011 are due to a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	During 2012 the valuation of these assets was essentially consistent with the 2011 valuations.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P65_S3	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2012 as compared to the prior year is principally due to the benefits recognized from the settlement of a tax audit during 2012 at one of our foreign subsidiaries, resulting in an approximate 21 percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate, principally from the ability to recognize net operating losses at this subsidiary.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	collaboration and quality, promoting a more uniform client experience and improved customer satisfaction, and encouraging innovation.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	In addition, we established a dedicated consulting organization during 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	We anticipate reporting segment information for our newly formed research, product, and consulting organizations in 2014.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	Throughout 2013 we evaluated our business operations based on our historical client group organization.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	Until October 2013 we were organized into two client groups with each client group responsible for writing relevant research for the roles within the client organization on a worldwide basis.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	The two client groups, which were considered operating segments, were: Business Technology ( BT ) and Marketing and Strategy ( M S ).
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S6	In addition, our Events segment supported both client groups.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S7	Each client group generated revenue through sales of research, advisory and other service offerings targeted at specific roles within their targeted clients.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P66_S8	Each client group consisted of research personnel focused primarily on issues relevant to particular roles and to the day-to-day responsibilities of persons within the roles.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Amounts included in the Events segment relate to the operations of the events production department.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Revenue reported in the Events segment consists primarily of sponsorships and sales of event tickets to Forrester events.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on direct margin.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Direct margin, as presented below, is defined as operating income excluding sales expenses, certain marketing and fulfillment expenses, stock-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets and reorganization costs.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	In the first quarter of 2013, we modified segment direct margin for each of the BT and M S clients groups to reflect the transfer of revenue and direct costs related to one product line from BT to M S and to reallocate certain shared consulting costs between BT and M S. Accordingly, the 2012 and 2011 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	BT revenues increased 1% and 5% during 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Research services revenues were flat during 2013 and increased 7% during 2012 as compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	Advisory and consulting services revenues increased 4% and were flat during 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	The decrease in the research services revenues growth rate in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to weaker demand in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily related to the Forrester Leadership Board product.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	The increase in advisory and consulting services growth rate in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to increased headcount in the new consulting organization as well as increased productivity of existing research analysts.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	periods compared to the prior years is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefit costs from increased headcount and annual merit increases combined with low revenue growth during both 2013 and 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	M S revenues increased 3% and 2% during 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	Research services revenues were flat during 2013 and increased 5% during 2012 as compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	Advisory and consulting services revenues increased 10% and decreased 5% during 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S4	The decrease in the research services revenues growth rate in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to weaker demand in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily related to our data subscription products.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S5	The increase in the advisory and consulting services growth rate in 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily due to strong demand in 2013 combined with increased productivity and increased headcount in the new consulting organization.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S6	Direct margin percentage during 2013 remained consistent compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S7	Events revenues were flat for 2013 and decreased 3% during 2012 compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S8	The number of events held in 2013 was consistent with 2012 and a slight increase in sponsorship revenues in 2013 was offset by a decline in paid event tickets.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S9	Direct margin increased during 2013 compared to the prior year due to cost controls.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S10	The decrease in revenue during 2012 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the smaller scope of events held in 2012 as compared to the prior year, resulting in less event ticket revenues.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P71_S11	The decrease in direct margin percentage during 2012 is primarily due to lower event ticket revenus compared to the prior year.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Research services revenues, which constituted approximately 68% of our revenues during 2013, are generally renewable annually and are typically payable in advance.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $30.7 million and $53.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	The $22.4 million decrease in cash provided from operations during 2013 is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $13.3 million in 2013 compared to 2012, and a decrease in cash collected from accounts receivable as we entered 2013 with a $6.8 million lower receivables balance as compared to 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	During 2013 we generated $57.6 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $60.4 million in net maturities of marketable investments partially offset by $3.1 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S5	Property and equipment purchases during 2013 consisted primarily of software and leasehold improvements.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S6	During 2012, we used $4.1 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $5.1 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a $0.9 million reduction in restricted cash.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P72_S7	Property and equipment purchases during 2012 consisted primarily of software and leasehold improvements.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	We regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations of investment grade.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	We used $113.4 million of cash from financing activities during 2013 primarily due to $118.2 million of purchases of our common stock, of which $75.1 million (including expenses) was purchased through our modified Dutch auction self-tender offer (described below) and $43.1 million was purchased on the open market subsequent to completion of the self-tender offer.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	In addition, during 2013 we paid $12.4 million of quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.15 per share dividend each quarter and received $17.4 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P73_S3	We used $31.7 million of cash from financing activities during 2012 primarily resulting from $29.8 million of purchases of our common stock, $12.6 million of dividend payments and $0.9 million of deferred payments from our 2011 acquisition of Springboard Research, partially offset by $11.2 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	On April 3, 2013 we commenced a modified Dutch auction self-tender offer to repurchase up to $130 million of our common stock at a price per share within the range of $32.00 to $36.00.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	A modified Dutch auction self-tender offer allows stockholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the company s specified range (in increments of $0.25 per share) they wish to tender.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The tender offer expired on May 1, 2013 and we purchased 2,054,732 shares of our common stock on May 7, 2013 at a purchase price of $36.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million plus $1.1 million of expenses related to the tender offer.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	We funded the repurchase from cash and marketable securities on hand.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	During 2013 our board of directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by $75 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	As of December 31, 2013 our remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $55.9 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	We plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during 2014, as market conditions warrant.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S5	As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $74.1 million and marketable investments of $81.0 million.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S6	We do not currently have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future except in the case of a significant acquisition.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S7	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P75_S8	As of December 31, 2013, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Principal amounts by maturity dates in U.S. dollars (dollars in thousands):
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements.
1023313_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro, British pound or other foreign currencies.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P0_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2013 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P7_S1	Forrester s products and services are targeted to specific roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and technology management principally at $1 billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P7_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P7_S3	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P8_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P8_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P8_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P9_S3	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Company s investments at December 31, 2012 with an auction reset feature were classified as long-term investments at December 31, 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Company s investments are composed of securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P13_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Prior to October 30, 2013 the Company held state and municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and continued to fail throughout 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	On October 30, 2013 the Company sold its entire portfolio of ARS for net proceeds of $9.1 million and realized a loss on the sale of $1.9 million.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P72_S3	Level 3 assets at December 31, 2012 consisted entirely of ARS.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	interest income on its ARS investments at each interest reset date (which occurred at either 7 or 35 day intervals for each security), these investments traded infrequently and therefore did not have a readily determinable market value.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	Interest rates on the securities ranged from 0.1% to 0.4% and 0.1% to 0.5% during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S2	The Company valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model that included unobservable inputs including estimates of interest rates, discount rates and expected holding periods of the securities, which is considered a Level 3 valuation.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S3	Unobservable inputs included in the valuation as of December 31, 2012 included a weighted average interest rate of 0.9%, a weighted average discount rate of 3.9%, and a weighted average holding period of 8.7 years.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S4	The valuation resulted in an unrealized loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $2.0 million at December 31, 2012.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S5	The Company believed that the loss was temporary due to the strong underlying credit rating of the securities and the fact that the Company did not intend to sell the securities and was not likely to be required to sell the securities.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P73_S6	The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
1023313_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	(6) Non-Marketable Investments At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of the Company s non-marketable investments, which were composed primarily of interests in technology-related private equity funds, were $5.7 million and $6.6 million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	One of the Company s investments, with a book value of $0.9 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is being accounted for using the cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments are limited partnerships and the Company has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, the Company records its share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded gains (losses) from its non-marketable investments of approximately $(0.6) million, $0.1 million and $(0.4) million, respectively, which are included in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	To date, no bonuses have been paid under the plan.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	(7) Income Taxes Income before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 consists of the following (in thousands):

1023313_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to Forrester s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:
1023313_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	In July 2012, one of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries licensed the intellectual property rights for the territory outside of the U.S. from the Company s U.S. entity in order to align the Company s business with its global operations.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	The license of intellectual property occurred between two wholly owned legal entities within Forrester that are based in different tax jurisdictions, creating a taxable gain reportable in the transferor entity s jurisdiction.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S2	The gain is recognized for income tax purposes only and not in the financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S3	As the gain was the result of an intra-entity transaction, it was eliminated in consolidation for purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S4	In accordance with GAAP, no gain or immediate tax impact should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of an intra-entity transaction.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S5	The Company recognizes tax expense specifically associated with an intra-entity transfer of intangible property over a period equal to the expected economic lives of the underlying assets being licensed.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S6	An amortization period of 9.5 years was determined based on the estimated economic lives of the intellectual property licensed.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S7	Current net deferred tax assets and long-term net deferred tax assets were $2.2 and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2013 and $0.4 and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2012, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P78_S8	Current net deferred tax liabilities and long-term net deferred tax liabilities were $0.2 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and $0.5 and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2012, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P79_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P79_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition and U.S. capital losses.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2013, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.7 million obtained from acquired businesses.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	If unused, these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019 through 2028.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S3	The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $25.2 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S4	Approximately $5.6 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S5	In the third quarter of 2012 the Company settled a tax audit at its German subsidiary resulting in the recognition of $5.9 million in deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and intangible assets at this subsidiary.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S6	As of December 31, 2013, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $2.3 million, of which $0.9 million expires in 2014, $0.8 million expires in 2016 and $0.6 million expires in 2018.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P81_S7	The following table provides a summary of the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
1023313_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately $0.4 million, ($0.3) million and $0.5 million, respectively, of net tax benefits (deficiencies) from tax deductions in excess of (or less than) book deductions resulting from employee stock option exercises.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	The net tax benefits (deficiencies) were recorded as an increase (decrease) to additional paid-in-capital.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized in the year that the deduction reduces the amount of cash payable for taxes.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P82_S3	Undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $10.7 million as of December 31, 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P82_S4	The Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the business.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P82_S5	Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, the amount of taxes attributable to the undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company utilizes a two-step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	The first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
1023313_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $2.0 million, all of which if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate in a future period.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	It is not expected that a significant amount of unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized within the next 12 months.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and such amounts were not material in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S., state, local and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2006, except to the extent of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from those years.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	Major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P90_S4	A modified Dutch auction self-tender offer allows stockholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the company s specified range (in increments of $0.25 per share) they wish to tender.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P90_S5	When the tender offer expired, based upon the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, the Company determined the purchase price, which was the lowest price per share within the range that enabled the Company to purchase up to $130 million of its common stock.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P90_S6	The tender offer expired on May 1, 2013 and the Company purchased 2,054,732 shares of its common stock on May 7, 2013 at a purchase price of $36.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million, plus approximately $1.1 million of expenses related to the tender offer.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P109_S1	During 2013 the Company also established a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to its clients, allowing the Company s analysts to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	Throughout 2013 the Company evaluated its business operations based on its historical client group organization.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	Until October 2013 the Company was organized into two client groups with each client group responsible for writing relevant research for the roles within the client organization on a worldwide basis.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P111_S1	The two client groups, which were considered operating segments, were: Business Technology ( BT ) and Marketing and Strategy ( M S ).
1023313_14_ITEM8_P111_S2	In addition, the Company s Events segment supported both client groups.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P111_S3	Each client group generated revenue through sales of research, advisory and other service offerings targeted at specific roles within their targeted clients.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P111_S4	Each client group consisted of research personnel focused primarily on issues relevant to particular roles and to the day-to-day responsibilities of persons within the roles.

1023313_14_ITEM8_P113_S1	In the first quarter of 2013, the Company modified segment direct margin for each of the BT and M S clients groups to reflect the transfer of revenue and direct costs related to one product line from BT to M S and to reallocate certain shared consulting costs between BT and M S. Accordingly, the 2012 and 2011 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P113_S2	The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P113_S3	The Company does not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
1023313_14_ITEM8_P113_S4	Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources.

1023313_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S6	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued (1992) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) of the Treadway Commission.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P1_S7	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2013, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Remediation Steps to Address Prior Material Weaknesses As of September 30, 2013, we reported that management had identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to the recognition of revenue for event tickets that are included in certain of our subscription products.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In addition, as of December 31, 2012, we reported that management had identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting related to revenue for advisory services and consulting projects.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We have made the following changes to our internal controls over financial reporting to remediate the previously reported material weaknesses.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Consulting Project Scoping: During the scoping phase of each project, we ensured that evidence was maintained of the review and approval of the allocation of the project revenue to the services to be delivered to the client and that the project allocation is accurately entered into our accounting system.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Advisory Services and Consulting Project Performance: Our project managers more closely monitored the performance of each advisory service and consulting project and maintained evidence of their review and approval of the services performed.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We ensured that we conducted proper training so that the remedial actions identified above were understood and followed by applicable personnel.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Additional procedures were implemented to reconcile the inputs in the manual calculation to additional data contained in our accounting system.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	New accounting system reports were generated to facilitate the reconciliation.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Analytical procedures were implemented and performed by our financial planning and analysis group (this group is separate from the accounting group that prepares the referenced calculations) to assess the reasonableness of the amount of event revenue recognized.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our remediation activities, including the testing of the operating effectiveness of the enhanced controls.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P7_S2	As a result, as of December 31, 2013, we concluded that we have remediated the previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As described above, we completed the remediation plans for the previously identified material weaknesses.
1023313_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	These actions constitute changes in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1023313_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our research products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment, or if we are unable to generate demand for and new sales of our membership-based research products and services due to competition or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Demand for Our Advisory and Consulting Services .
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Advisory and consulting services revenues comprised 27% of our total revenues in 2014 and 26% in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Consulting engagements generally are project-based and non-recurring.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P0_S8	A decline in our ability to fulfill existing or generate new project consulting engagements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Business may be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If conditions in the United States and the global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our research and advisory services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We have clients in approximately 60 countries and approximately 26% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients sourced by the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We have undergone a substantial internal reorganization.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Beginning in 2013, we began to transition the provision of consulting services from our research personnel to consultants in our dedicated consulting organization and have hired additional consulting employees to build out this organization.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S7	At the same time, we have hired and continue to increase the number of our quota carrying sales employees.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S8	We have incurred material expenses in connection with these actions.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P3_S9	If we do not realize anticipated benefits from these actions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely effected.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research analysts, consultants, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our future success will also depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research to meet the changing information needs of our clients.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We compete in the market for research products and services with other independent providers of similar services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We may also face increased competition from Internet-based research firms.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, information-gathering, and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies, survey-based general market research firms and general business consulting firms.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failure to Enforce and Protect our Intellectual Property Rights .
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Unauthorized third parties may obtain or use our proprietary information despite our efforts to protect it.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States and accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use or distribution, which could adversely affect our business.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Trends in technology and research and advisory services spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our research services from clients.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The hiring and training of new analysts, consultants, and sales personnel.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Changes in demand for our research and advisory services.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	A portion of our income is generated outside of the United States and is taxed at rates significantly less than rates applicable to income generated in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions in which we do business.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our effective tax rate in the future, and accordingly our results of operations and financial position, could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax law or if more of our income becomes taxable in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our largest stockholder is our Chairman and CEO, George F. Colony, who owns approximately 44% of our outstanding stock.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	This concentration of ownership enables Mr. Colony to strongly influence or effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	This concentration of ownership may also limit the liquidity of our stock.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As a result, efforts by stockholders to change the direction, management or ownership of Forrester may be unsuccessful, and stockholders may not be able to freely purchase and sell shares of our stock.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Any Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.
1023313_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	There can be no assurance that no weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will occur in future periods, or that any such weakness will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	facility accommodates research, marketing, sales, consulting, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Paris, New Delhi, and Singapore.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	Our San Francisco lease is for approximately 19,000 square feet, with a term that expires June 30, 2016.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our New York lease is for approximately 15,200 square feet, with an initial term until January 31, 2021, with the right to terminate in 2017 with prior notice and payment of designated early termination fees and charges.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S5	The London lease is for approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term that expires September 24, 2021.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P0_S6	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR .
1023313_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	During 2013, quarterly dividends of $0.15 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	During 2014, quarterly dividends of $0.16 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P0_S3	In February 2015 our Board of Directors declared an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share that is payable on March 18, 2015.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of March 6, 2015 there were approximately 34 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	On March 6, 2015 the closing price of our common stock was $37.20 per share.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	The following table represents the ranges of high and low sale prices of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013: Through 2014, our Board of Directors authorized an aggregate $410.0 million to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program including $25.0 million authorized in April 2014, $25.0 million authorized in July 2013 and $50.0 million authorized in February 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S3	As of December 31, 2014 we had repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $402.2 million.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S4	During 2013 the Company retired 11.7 million shares of treasury stock.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S5	These retired shares are now included in the Company s pool of authorized but unissued shares.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P1_S6	The retired stock had a carrying value of approximately $303.0 million.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2014 we repurchased the following shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program:
1023313_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) All purchases of our common stock were made under the stock repurchase program first announced in 2001.
1023313_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2014 with the cumulative return during the same period for the Russell 2000 and the S P 600 Small Cap Information Technology Index, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were reinvested.
1023313_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	The 2013 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes a $1.9 million loss for the sale of the Company s entire portfolio of auction rate securities.
1023313_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	The 2012 net income amount includes a $5.9 million deferred income tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a tax audit at the Company s German subsidiary.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to our research and data products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting events.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our research.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P1_S4	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research and consulting personnel and all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities and annual fees for cloud-based information technology systems are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention, enrichment and number of clients are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Clients we count as a single client the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent and we also aggregate separate instrumentalities of the federal, state, and provincial governments as single clients.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2014 decreased 5% compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	When including the amount of future invoicing for contracts at December 31, 2014, the combined amount of deferred revenue and future invoicing decreased 6% compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The decrease in deferred revenue and future invoicing was due to (1) the difference in foreign currency rates in 2014 compared to 2013 that resulted in a 2% decrease, and (2) a shift in the timing of the contract renewal date of approximately $10 million of contracts from December 2014 to January 2015 that resulted in an approximate 4% decrease.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2013 increased 2% compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	However when including the amount of future invoicing for contracts at December 31, 2013, the combined amount of deferred revenue and future invoicing was flat compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	The change in deferred revenue plus future invoicing for both 2014 and 2013 is reflective of the fact that contract bookings and revenue have grown at essentially the same rates during 2014 and 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	Agreement value increased 7% at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year and decreased 2% at December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S7	The increase in the growth rate of agreement value in 2014 is due to increased demand for our products combined with an improvement in client and dollar retention rates during 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S8	Client retention and dollar retention rates have improved steadily during 2014 compared to 2013 levels.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P11_S9	The 2013 rates were at multi-year lows due in part to the negative effects from the challenges associated with the implementation of a sales reorganization in early 2012, high sales employee attrition during 2013 and 2012, a difficult selling environment in Europe and weaker demand for our data subscription products in 2013, in part due to the phasing out of our standalone Tech Marketing Navigator data product.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research (including our data subscription products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the discount is applied ratably to the research and data products only (which commence delivery on the first day of the contract), as the undelivered products in the contract (advisory services or events) would be refundable to the customer at list price if not delivered.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We obtain the selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Research services revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S6	Contracts for RoleView research are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P19_S7	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data advisor, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	Beginning in February 2013, we discontinued our policy of offering our clients a service guarantee.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Service guarantees had provided our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	Furthermore, our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, dividend yields and forfeiture rates.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Expected dividend yields are based on expectations of current and future dividends, if any.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	We are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P23_S5	If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimates, or if our estimates of forfeitures are modified in a future period, the actual stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $3.8 million at December 31, 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had $80.1 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The annual assessment of goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment, or a combination of both.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2014 utilizing a qualitative assessment and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units more likely than not continues to exceed their respective carrying values.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	In connection with our new organizational structure, goodwill was allocated to our new reporting units (which are our three business segments) on a relative fair value basis.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Research and Products reporting units were allocated $77.4 million and $2.6 million of goodwill, respectively, as of January 1, 2014 while the Project Consulting reporting unit was allocated zero goodwill.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	We performed an interim quantitative impairment test and concluded that the fair values of the Research and Products reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives as of December 31, 2014 consist primarily of acquired customer relationships and were valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	compared to 2013 Revenues The 5% increase in revenues during 2014 compared to 2013 was driven by a 10% increase in advisory services and events revenues while research services revenues increased 2% during the period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	Foreign exchange fluctuations had an insignificant effect on total revenue growth during 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	While revenues from customers outside of the U.S. increased 1% during 2014 compared to the prior year, the percentage of revenues attributable to customers outside of the U.S. decreased by less than one percentage point during 2014 compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	Foreign exchange fluctuations had an effect of decreasing foreign revenue growth in 2014 by approximately 1% compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P37_S4	We continued to experience stronger growth during 2014 in the U.S. region compared to outside of the U.S. Growth in the Asia Pacific region and Canada was partially offset by a revenue decline (on a constant currency basis) in the European region.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P37_S5	The general economic conditions in Europe as well as sales leadership challenges have contributed to a difficult selling environment in that region.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue primarily on a ratable basis over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Research services revenues increased 2% during 2014 compared to the prior year, which is essentially consistent with the related contract bookings growth during this period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	Revenues from our data subscription products declined by approximately $1.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, the majority of which was due to the phasing out of our Tech Marketing Navigator product that began in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	The decline in data subscription revenues was offset by growth in our research product revenues.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Revenue from advisory services and events increased 10% during 2014 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S5	The increase was driven by strong growth in advisory and consulting revenues due primarily to strong demand for both advisory and consulting services and an increase in consulting headcount as we completed the build out of a dedicated consulting organization that began in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S6	Events revenues were flat during 2014 as compared to 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P38_S7	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and contribution margin results by segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment expenses during 2014 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $7.8 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees (consisting of consulting and product specialist employees) and annual merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	We hired additional consulting employees during 2013 and 2014 to build out a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to our clients, allowing our analysts to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, 2014 includes increased costs for stock compensation and travel and entertainment (primarily for billable expenses for consulting projects).
1023313_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	Selling and Marketing The increase in selling and marketing expenses during 2014 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in sales employees, annual merit increases and increased commission costs resulting from a higher number of sales employees achieving their sales plan, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	Subject to the business environment, we intend to expand our quota carrying sales force by approximately 9% to 11% in 2015 as compared to 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	Any resulting increase in contract bookings of our research services would generally be recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2014 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from increased headcount and annual merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense, and higher stock compensation costs of $0.7 million.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	These increases were partially offset by lower professional services expenses in 2014 due primarily to lower accounting and legal costs.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Depreciation Depreciation expense during 2014 was essentially consistent with the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P41_S3	There was a decrease in depreciation during 2014 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during 2014 and this decrease was offset by an increase in depreciation resulting from a $0.4 million immaterial out-of-period adjustment recorded during 2014 to correct an understatement error of depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million in each of 2013 and 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P41_S4	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense remained essentially consistent during 2014 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Reorganization Costs During 2014 we incurred $1.8 million of severance and related costs for the termination of approximately 1% of our employees across various geographies and functions primarily to realign resources due to our new organizational structure implemented in late 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The costs under this plan were substantially paid by the end of 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	During 2013 we incurred $1.9 million of severance and related costs for the elimination of 31 jobs or approximately 2.5% of our workforce worldwide in an effort to streamline our operations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	On February 11, 2015, we announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately 50 positions or 4% of our employees across various geographies and functions, in order to reallocate investment in 2015 to planned sales expansion and to delivery areas seeing the greatest client demand.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S4	Overall we expect to increase our headcount by 7% at the end of 2015 compared to 2014 levels.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S5	We expect to incur pre-tax expenses of $3.5 million to $4.0 million in the first and second quarters of 2015 related principally to cash severance and related benefit costs for terminated employees.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S6	Income from Operations Income from operations declined $4.0 million during 2014 as compared to the prior year and declined to 5.8% of total revenues in 2014 from 7.3% in the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S7	Although revenues increased by $14.4 million in 2014, this was offset by a $17.0 million increase in compensation and benefit costs during 2014 from additional headcount investments in our consulting, product and sales organizations and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P42_S8	We anticipate income from operations as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat in 2015 as compared to 2014, as the projected rate of expense growth in 2015 is expected to equal the projected rate of revenue growth in 2015.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	The decrease in other income, net during 2014 is primarily due to lower interest income earned in 2014 due to lower investment balances, which was partially offset by lower foreign currency losses in 2014 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	Gains (Losses) on Investments, Net Gains (losses) on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains (losses) from our technology-related investment funds and gains (losses) from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	In 2014 we realized an approximate $0.4 million loss from our equity method investments primarily from a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds, and realized approximately $0.1 million of gains from other investments.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	During 2013 we sold our portfolio of auction rate securities (par value $11.0 million) for a realized loss of $1.9 million.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	In addition, in 2013 we realized an approximate $0.7 million loss from our equity method investments primarily from a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds, and realized approximately $0.1 million of gains from other investments.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The increase in the effective tax rate during 2014 as compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the following: the inclusion in 2013 of foreign tax credits that did not recur in 2014; an immaterial out-of-period error recorded in 2014 that increased tax expense by $0.5 million; a lower foreign tax rate benefit in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a smaller portion of our income being earned outside of the U.S. during 2014, and higher state taxes due to an ongoing state audit that increased tax expense by $0.1 million in 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	These increases were partially offset by a benefit from decreasing our valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses due to the utilization of a portion of these losses in 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	compared to 2012 Revenues The 2% increase in revenues during 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by a 5% increase in advisory services and events revenues while research services revenues were essentially flat during the period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Foreign exchange fluctuations had an insignificant effect on revenue growth during 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. in 2013 declined by 2% as a percentage of total revenues compared to the prior year period due primarily to a decline in revenues from the European region.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	The general economic conditions in Europe as well as sales leadership challenges have contributed to a difficult selling environment in that region.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	Research services revenues were flat during 2013 compared to the prior year as contract bookings during those periods were essentially flat.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S5	Revenues from our data subscription products declined by approximately $2.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the phasing out of our standalone Tech Marketing Navigator data product in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S6	The decline in data subscription revenues was partially offset by an increase in research product revenue.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S7	Revenues from advisory services and events increased 5% during 2013 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S8	The increase during 2013 is due entirely to increased advisory and project consulting revenues, as event revenues were flat in 2013 compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S9	The increase in advisory and project consulting revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012 was generated in the second half of 2013 and was due primarily to both an increase in consulting headcount as we began to build out a dedicated consulting organization in 2013 as well as to increased productivity of our analyst personnel.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S10	Cost of Services and Fulfillment The increase in cost of services and fulfillment expenses during 2013 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting primarily from an increase in the number of employees, an increase in incentive bonus payments and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S11	In addition, 2013 included an increase in facility costs due to new office space in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of 2012 and an increase in service fees for cloud-based information systems.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S12	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees related to the amount of surveys performed and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P46_S13	We hired additional consulting employees in 2013 in support of our decision to build a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to our clients, allowing our analysts to spend additional timing on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expenses during 2013 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $5.2 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from both an increase in sales and marketing employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	In addition, 2013 included an increase in facility costs due to new office space in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of 2012 and an increase in service fees for cloud-based information systems.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2013 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in compensation and benefits costs due to an increase in incentive bonus payments and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S4	In addition, 2013 included an increase in recruiting costs to support company-wide hiring in 2013 as well as an increase in facility costs due to new office space in the Asia Pacific region in the second half of 2012 and an increase in service fees for cloud-based information systems.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S5	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees primarily related to a decrease in information technology projects as 2012 included an update to our website and implementation of new customer relationship management software.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S6	Depreciation Depreciation expense increased $0.3 million during 2013 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from the initiation of depreciation for our new website in March 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S7	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense remained essentially consistent during 2013 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S8	Reorganization Costs During 2013 we incurred $1.9 million of severance and related costs for the elimination of 31 jobs or approximately 2.5% of our workforce worldwide to streamline our operations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S9	Essentially all costs incurred for the reorganization were paid during 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S10	We incurred $1.4 million of severance and related costs during 2012 for the termination of 17 employees related to the sales reorganization and other cost reduction initiatives.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P47_S11	Essentially all of these costs were paid during 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Income from Operations Income from operations declined $8.9 million during 2013 as compared to the prior year and declined to 7.3% of total revenues in 2013 from 10.5% in the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The decrease in both dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during 2013 is due primarily to low revenue growth in 2013 combined with increased compensation costs in 2013 from additional headcount investments in our consulting and sales organizations and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our marketable securities as well as gains (losses) on foreign currency.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The decrease in other income, net during 2013 is primarily due to lower interest income earned in 2013 due to lower investment balances.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Gains (Losses) on Investments, Net Gains (losses) on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains (losses) from our technology-related investment funds and gains (losses) from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	In 2013 we sold our portfolio of auction rate securities (par value $11.0 million) for a realized loss of $1.9 million.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, in 2013 we realized an approximate $0.7 million loss from our equity method investments primarily from a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds, and realized approximately $0.1 million of gains from other investments.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	During 2012 the valuation of the assets within these funds remained essentially consistent with the 2011 valuations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	Gains (losses) from the sale of marketable securities were insignificant in 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	The increase in the effective tax rate during 2013 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the inclusion in 2012 of a tax benefit from the settlement of a tax audit by our German subsidiary that resulted in a 21 percentage point reduction in the effective tax rate, and to higher non-deductible expenses in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P50_S6	This increase in the rate in 2013 was partially offset by an increase in the benefit of the foreign tax rate differential on non-U.S earnings due to higher foreign earnings, foreign tax credits realized in 2013 and a lower state rate in 2013 due to changes in income apportionment in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	At the end of 2013 we reorganized our fulfillment organization into a single global research organization and a single global product organization to better support our client base by facilitating better research collaboration and quality, promoting a more uniform client experience and improved customer satisfaction, and encouraging innovation.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	During 2013 we also established a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to our clients, allowing our research personnel to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	As of January 1, 2014 we conformed our internal reporting to match the new organizational structure and as such we are reporting segment information for the newly formed Research, Product and Project Consulting organizations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	The 2013 and 2012 segment amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Research segment includes the costs of our research personnel who are responsible for writing the research and performing the webinars and inquiries for our RoleView product.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	In addition, the research personnel deliver advisory services (such as workshops, speeches and advisory days) and a portion of our project consulting services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenue in this segment includes only revenue from advisory services and project consulting services that are delivered by the research personnel in this segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	During 2013, we began to transition the delivery of project consulting to a dedicated project consulting organization.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The transition was essentially complete by the end of 2014 such that the vast majority of project consulting will be delivered by the project consulting organization in 2015.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Product segment includes the costs of the product management organization that is responsible for product pricing and packaging and the launch of new products.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	In addition, this segment includes the costs of our data, Forrester Leadership Boards and events organizations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Revenue in this segment includes all of our revenue (including RoleView) except for revenue from advisory services and project consulting services that are delivered by personnel in the Research and Project Consulting segments.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Project Consulting segment includes the costs of the consultants that deliver our project consulting services.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	During 2013 we began to hire dedicated consultants to transition the delivery of project consulting services from research personnel (included in the Research segment) to the new Project Consulting segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Revenue in this segment includes the project consulting revenue delivered by the consultants in this segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	Revenue and expenses in 2012 include the activity of a pre-existing dedicated consulting team that performed consulting services that were outside of the scope of the consulting delivered by research personnel.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on segment revenues and expenses.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S5	Segment expenses include the direct expenses of each segment organization and exclude selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, adjustments to incentive bonus compensation from target amounts, amortization of intangible assets, reorganization costs, other income and gains (losses) on investments.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P55_S6	The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Product segment revenues increased 3% during 2014 compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Research services revenues increased 2% during 2014 compared to the prior year, which is essentially consistent with the related contract bookings growth during this period.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Revenues from our data subscription products declined by approximately $1.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, the majority of which was due to the phasing out of our Tech Marketing Navigator product that began in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	The decline in data subscription revenues was offset by growth in our research product revenues.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	Events revenues were $12.9 million during 2014 which were flat compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S5	Data advisory revenues increased approximately $1.3 million in 2014 compared to the prior year, representing growth of 20%.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S6	Product segment expenses increased 8% during 2014 due primarily to a $3.1 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due to an increase in the number of employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S7	Product segment revenues increased 1% during 2013 compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S8	Research services revenues were flat during 2013 compared to the prior year as contract bookings during those periods were essentially flat.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S9	Revenues from our data subscription products declined by approximately $2.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the phasing out of our standalone Tech Marketing Navigator data product in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S10	The decline in data subscription revenues was partially offset by an increase in research product revenue.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S11	Events revenues were $12.9 million during 2013 which were flat compared to the prior year.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S12	Data advisory revenues increased approximately $1.5 million in 2013 compared to the prior year, representing growth of 30%.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S13	Product segment expenses were flat during 2013 due primarily to a $0.6 million increase in compensation and benefit costs being offset by lower travel and entertainment costs and professional services expenses.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S14	Research segment revenues decreased 16% during 2014 compared to the prior year due to the transition of the performance of project consulting services from personnel in our Research segment to personnel in our Project Consulting segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S15	Research segment expenses decreased by 9% during 2014 due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in the number of employees in the Research segment related to the continued transition in the delivery of project consulting services to the Project Consulting segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S16	Research segment revenues increased 2% during 2013 compared to the prior year due primarily to an increase in advisory revenue from increased productivity from our analyst personnel.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S17	This increase was partially offset by the start of the transition of the performance of project consulting services from personnel in our Research segment to personnel in our Project Consulting segment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S18	Research segment expenses increased 2% during 2013 due primarily to a $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefit costs which were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment costs and professional services expenses.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S19	Project Consulting segment revenues increased 100% and 16% during 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, due primarily to the ongoing transition of the performance of project consulting services from research personnel in our Research segment to consulting personnel, strong demand for certain consulting projects, and increased headcount to deliver the projects.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P56_S20	Project Consulting segment expenses increased 73% and 20% during 2014 and 2013, respectively, due primarily to a $10.0 million and $2.1 million increase, respectively, in compensation and benefit costs due to an increase in the number of employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Research services revenues, which constituted approximately 66% of our revenues during 2014, are generally renewable annually and are typically payable in advance.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $28.8 million and $30.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	The $1.9 million decrease in cash provided from operations during 2014 is primarily attributable to a $4.8 million increase in cash paid for income taxes during 2014 and a $2.2 million decrease in net income in 2014 compared to 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P57_S4	These decreases in cash were partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in cash generated from accounts receivable and deferred revenue in 2014 compared to 2013, due in part to higher contract bookings during 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P57_S5	During 2014 we generated $24.8 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $24.7 million in net maturities of marketable investments and $1.5 million of distributions from our non-marketable investments, partially offset by $1.5 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	equipment purchases during 2014 consisted primarily of software.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	During 2013 we generated $57.6 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $60.4 million in net maturities of marketable investments partially offset by $3.1 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Property and equipment purchases during 2013 consisted primarily of software and leasehold improvements.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	We regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations of investment grade.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	We used $75.9 million of cash from financing activities during 2014 primarily due to $73.2 million of purchases of our common stock.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	In addition, during 2014 we paid $12.0 million of quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.16 per share dividend each quarter and we received $9.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	We used $113.4 million of cash from financing activities during 2013 primarily due to $118.2 million of purchases of our common stock, of which $75.1 million (including expenses) was purchased through our modified Dutch auction self-tender offer (described below) and $43.1 million was purchased on the open market subsequent to completion of the self-tender offer.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	In addition, during 2013 we paid $12.4 million of quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.15 per share dividend each quarter and we received $17.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	On April 3, 2013 we commenced a modified Dutch auction self-tender offer to repurchase up to $130 million of our common stock at a price per share within the range of $32.00 to $36.00.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	A modified Dutch auction self-tender offer allows stockholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the company s specified range (in increments of $0.25 per share) they wish to tender.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	When the tender offer expired, based upon the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, we determined the purchase price, which was the lowest price per share within the range that enabled us to purchase up to $130 million of our common stock.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	The tender offer expired on May 1, 2013 and we purchased 2,054,732 shares of our common stock on May 7, 2013 at a purchase price of $36.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million plus $1.1 million of expenses related to the tender offer.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S4	We funded the repurchase from cash and marketable securities on hand.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S5	During 2014 our board of directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by $25 million.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S6	As of December 31, 2014 our remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $7.8 million.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S7	In February 2015 our board of directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by an additional $25 million, bringing the total remaining authorization to $28.4 million at the time of the increase.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S8	We plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during 2015, as market conditions warrant.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S9	As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $49.7 million and marketable investments of $54.9 million.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S10	These balances include $33.4 million held outside of the U.S.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S11	If these funds outside of the U.S. are needed for operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S12	However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S13	We do not currently have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future except in the case of a significant acquisition.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S14	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S15	As of December 31, 2014, we had future contractual obligations as follows: As of December 31, 2014 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was $2.1 million and was included in non-current liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P60_S16	These amounts were not included in the table above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities during the course of the year, which may include U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Principal amounts by maturity dates in U.S. dollars (dollars in thousands): Foreign Currency Exchange.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements.
1023313_15_ITEM7A_P9_S1	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro, British pound or other foreign currencies.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S6	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P0_S9	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1023313_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2014 (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P7_S1	Forrester s products and services are targeted to specific roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and technology management principally at $1 billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P7_S2	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P7_S3	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S4	Out-of-Period Errors During 2014 the Company recorded $0.3 million of pre-tax expenses ($0.2 million post tax) for out-of-period corrections, of which $0.4 million related to depreciation and $(0.1) million related to other immaterial amounts that related to prior periods.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S5	In addition, during 2014 the Company recorded $0.5 million of additional income tax expense for an out-of-period correction.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P8_S6	The Company has concluded that these items are immaterial to all current and prior period financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The Company s portfolio of investments may at any time include securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	Forrester accounts for all marketable investments as available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1023313_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P13_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 3% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	In connection with the Company s new organizational structure, goodwill was allocated to its new reporting units (which are the Company s three business segments) on a relative fair value basis.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	The Company performed an interim quantitative impairment test and concluded that there was no indication of impairment.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	Impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as non-current liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Non-current deferred rent liability at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $6.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively, and primarily results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Company s facility leases.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The functional currency of the majority of Forrester s wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currency.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	These subsidiary financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1023313_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Gains and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Forrester recorded $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in thousands): Reclassification adjustments for net gains (losses) are reported in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Revenue Recognition Forrester generates revenues from licensing research (including our data subscription products), performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Forrester executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P25_S2	Revenues are presented net of any sales or value added taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the government.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P25_S3	Revenue contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P25_S4	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products and services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company obtains the selling prices of its products and services based on an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Research services revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues, which are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P26_S3	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P26_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P26_S5	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Contracts for RoleView are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each of these elements based upon their relative selling prices, which is based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data advisor, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	For all contracts entered into through January 2013, clients were offered a service guarantee, which gave them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	As of February 1, 2013 the Company discontinued its policy of offering all clients a service guarantee.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee, which generally equals the vesting period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock-based awards are classified as financing cash flows.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company is required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	The Company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P30_S5	Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the following expense categories (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The options granted under the equity incentive plan and shares subject to the employee stock purchase plan were valued utilizing the Black Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values: Dividend yields are based on the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend program approved by the board of directors in February 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forrester s common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	The risk-free interest rate used is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the award s expected term.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P32_S3	The expected term calculation is based upon Forrester s historical experience of exercise patterns.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of December 31, 2014 was $15.8 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 2.5 years.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make contractually obligated payments.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment terms.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Forrester provides for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, computed using the straight-line method, over estimated useful lives of assets as follows:
1023313_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Forrester provides for amortization of intangible assets, computed using an accelerated method according to the expected cash flows to be received from the underlying assets, over the respective lives as follows:
1023313_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	1 Year Income Taxes Forrester recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Forrester s provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P40_S3	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P40_S4	The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P40_S5	The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	The weighted average number of common equivalent shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury-stock method.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Basic and diluted weighted average common shares are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, options to purchase approximately 0.6 million, 0.7 million and 0.8 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the diluted weighted average common share calculation as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements, including most industry-specific guidance.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive for those goods or services.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	For Forrester, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2017.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S5	The Company has not yet selected a transition method.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P44_S6	The Company is currently evaluating the potential changes from this ASU to its future financial reporting and disclosures.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The standard addresses the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	The standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S3	The adoption of this ASU as of January 1, 2014 did not have a material effect on the Company s financial position.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S4	(2) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets At the end of 2013 the Company reorganized its fulfillment organization into a single global research organization and a single global product organization to better support its client base by facilitating better research collaboration and quality, promoting a more uniform client experience and improved customer satisfaction, and encouraging innovation.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S5	During 2013 the Company also established a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to its clients, allowing the Company s research personnel to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S6	As of January 1, 2014 the Company conformed its internal reporting to match the new organizational structure and as such is reporting segment information for the newly formed Research, Product and Project Consulting organizations.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S7	The goodwill previously allocated to the former Business Technology ( BT ), Marketing and Strategy ( M S ), and Events segments has been reassigned to the Products, Research and Project Consulting segments based on the relative fair values of the new segments.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P45_S8	A summary of the goodwill by segment and the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is shown in the following table (in thousands).
1023313_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) As of December 31, 2014, the Company had no accumulated goodwill impairment losses.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	A summary of Forrester s intangible assets is as follows (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately $2.2 million, $2.2 million and $2.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Estimated amortization expense related to intangible assets that will continue to be amortized is as follows (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	(3) Marketable Investments The following table summarizes the Company s marketable investments, all of which are classified as available-for-sale (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The following table summarizes the maturity periods of the marketable securities in the Company s portfolio as of December 31, 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and market value of Forrester s available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other-than-temporary, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands): Realized gains or losses on sales of the Company s federal obligations, state and municipal bonds and corporate bonds were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	During 2013 the Company sold its entire portfolio of ARS (par value $11.0 million) for a realized loss of $1.9 million that is included in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	The following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets (cash equivalents and marketable investments) measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	(1) Included in cash and cash equivalents.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	(2) $6.2 million included in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 as original maturities at the time of purchase were 90 days or less.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Level 2 assets consist of the Company s entire portfolio of federal, state, municipal and corporate bonds.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	Level 2 assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation methods, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 the Company held no Level 3 assets.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Prior to October 30, 2013 the Company held state and municipal bonds with an auction reset feature (auction rate securities or ARS ).
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	In February 2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and continued to fail throughout 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	On October 30, 2013 the Company sold its entire portfolio of ARS for net proceeds of $9.1 million and realized a loss on the sale of $1.9 million.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	Level 3 assets at December 31, 2012 consisted entirely of ARS.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S4	While the Company received interest income on its ARS investments at each interest reset date (which occurred at either 7 or 35 day intervals for each security), these investments traded infrequently and therefore did not have a readily determinable market value.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S5	Interest rates on the securities ranged from 0.1% to 0.4% and 0.1% to 0.5% during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S6	The Company valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model that included unobservable inputs including estimates of interest rates, discount rates and expected holding periods of the securities, which is considered a Level 3 valuation.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P55_S7	The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) One of the Company s investments, with a book value of $0.7 million and $0.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is being accounted for using the cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments are limited partnerships and the Company has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, the Company records its share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded gains (losses) from its non-marketable investments of $(0.3) million, $(0.6) million and $0.1 million, respectively, which are included in gains (losses) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, gross distributions of $1.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, were received from the funds.

1023313_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	To date, no bonuses have been paid under the plan.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	The plan will now automatically expire on June 30, 2015, subject to earlier expiration as provided in the plan in the event that prior to such date there are less than 10 participants in the plan or all of the Company s invested capital (as defined in the plan) has been returned to the Company.

1023313_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	In July 2012, one of the Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries licensed the intellectual property rights for the territory outside of the U.S. from the Company s U.S. entity in order to align the Company s business with its global operations.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The license of intellectual property occurred between two wholly owned legal entities within Forrester that are based in different tax jurisdictions, creating a taxable gain reportable in the transferor entity s jurisdiction.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The gain is recognized for income tax purposes only and not in the financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	As the gain was the result of an intra-entity transaction, it was eliminated in consolidation for purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P60_S4	In accordance with GAAP, no gain or immediate tax impact should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of an intra-entity transaction.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P60_S5	The Company recognizes tax expense specifically associated with an intra-entity transfer of intangible property over a period equal to the expected economic lives of the underlying assets being licensed.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Current net deferred tax assets and long-term net deferred tax assets were $4.6 and $7.9 million as of December 31, 2014 and $2.2 and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2013, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Current net deferred tax liabilities and long-term net deferred tax liabilities were $0.2 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2014 and $0.2 and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2013, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P62_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $1.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition and U.S. capital losses.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5.4 million obtained from acquired businesses.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S3	If unused, these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019 through 2028.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S4	The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $23.5 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S5	Approximately $5.0 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S6	In 2012 the Company settled a tax audit at its German subsidiary resulting in the recognition of $5.9 million in deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and intangible assets at this subsidiary.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P63_S7	As of December 31, 2014, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $1.2 million, of which $0.8 million expires in 2016 and $0.4 million expires in 2018.

1023313_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized approximately $0.4 million and $(0.3) million, respectively, of net tax benefits (deficiencies) from tax deductions in excess of (or less than) book deductions resulting from employee stock option exercises.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Net tax benefits were insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	The net tax benefits (deficiencies) were recorded as an increase (decrease) to additional paid-in-capital.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P64_S3	Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized in the year that the deduction reduces the amount of cash payable for taxes.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Undistributed earnings of the Company s foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $15.6 million as of December 31, 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the business.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, the amount of taxes attributable to the undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Company utilizes a two-step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	The first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	The second step determines the measurement of the tax position.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P66_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $2.1 million, all of which if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate in a future period.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	It is not expected that a significant amount of unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized within the next 12 months.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and such amounts were not significant in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S., state, local and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2009, except to the extent of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from those years.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	During 2014 the Internal Revenue Service completed the audit of the Company s 2011 consolidated Federal income tax return and there were no material adjustments.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	(6) Commitments As of December 31, 2014, Forrester had future contractual obligations as follows for operating leases (in thousands):
1023313_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The cost of these operating leases, including any contractual rent increases, rent concessions, and landlord incentives, are recognized ratably over the life of the related lease agreement.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	Aggregate rent expense was $15.9 million, $15.3 million and $14.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

1023313_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The shares repurchased may be used, among other things, in connection with Forrester s equity incentive and purchase plans.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P74_S2	As of December 31, 2014 the Company had repurchased approximately 14.4 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $402.2 million.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	On April 3, 2013 the Company commenced a modified Dutch auction self-tender offer to repurchase up to $130 million of its common stock at a price per share within the range of $32.00 to $36.00.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	A modified Dutch auction self-tender offer allows stockholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the company s specified range (in increments of $0.25 per share) they wish to tender.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P75_S2	When the tender offer expired, based upon the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, the Company determined the purchase price, which was the lowest price per share within the range that enabled the Company to purchase up to $130 million of its common stock.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P75_S3	The tender offer expired on May 1, 2013 and the Company purchased 2,054,732 shares of its common stock on May 7, 2013 at a purchase price of $36.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million, plus approximately $1.1 million of expenses related to the tender offer.

1023313_15_ITEM8_P75_S6	The retired stock had a carrying value of approximately $303.0 million.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P75_S7	The Company s accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value of the retired stock from Common Stock and to reflect the excess of cost over par value as a deduction from Additional Paid-in Capital.
1023313_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Dividends During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company declared and paid four quarterly dividends of $0.16, $0.15 and $0.14 per share each quarter, respectively, amounting to $0.64 or $12.0 million, $0.60 or $12.4 million and $0.56 per share or $12.6 million per year, respectively.

1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S6	In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S7	Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2014, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1023313_15_ITEM9A_P1_S8	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1023313_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment that involves risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	A Decline in Renewal s or Demand for Our Membership-Based Research and Data Services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our R esearch , Data, and Leadership Boards products and s ervices.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment, or failure to generate demand for and new sales of our membership-based products and services due to competition or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our results of op erations and financial condition.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Demand for Our Advisory and Consulting Services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Advisory and consulting services revenues comprised 30% of our total revenues in 2015 and 27% in 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Consulting engagements generally are project-based and non-recurring.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	A decline in our ability to fulfill existing or generate new project consulting engagements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our Business may be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If conditions in the United States and the global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our products and services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We have clients in approximately 60 countries and approximately 23% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients sourced by the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	We have undergone substantial internal reorganizations.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Beginning in 2013, we began to transition the provision of consulting services from our research personnel to consultants in our dedicated consulting organization and have hired additional consulting employees to build out this organization.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S7	At the same time, we hired additional quota carrying sales employees.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S8	In 2013, we created global research and product organizations to better collaborate and improve our client s experience, and in 2015, we combined our research and product organizations into a global organization headed by a Chief Research and Product officer.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S9	We have incurred material expenses in connection with these actions.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P4_S10	If we do not realize anticipated benefits from these actions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely effected.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research and data professionals, consultants, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our future success will also depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research , data, advisory services, and other related products and services to meet the changing needs of our clients.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The en vironment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of subs tantial resources.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We compete in the market for research, data, advisory, and related products and services with other independent providers of similar services, as well as survey-based general market research firms, marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, providers of peer networking services and digital media measurement services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Some of our competitors, such as Gartner and various global management consulting firms, have substantially greater financial, information-gathering, and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our indirect competitors may choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more market segments addressed by our products and services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Failure to Enforce and Protect our Intellectual Property Rights.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Unauthorized third parties may obtain or use our proprietary information despite our efforts to protect it.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States and accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use or distribution, which could adversely affect our business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Privacy laws and regulations, and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations, in the U.S, Europe and other countries around the world where we conduct business are sometimes inconsistent and frequently changing.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Compliance with these laws, or changing interpretations and application of these laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to take action in a manner that would be adverse to our business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Trends in technology and research, data and advisory services spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our products and services from clients.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The hiring and training of new research and data professionals, consultants, and sales personnel.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Changes in demand for our research, data and advisory services.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	A portion of our income is generated outside of the United States and is taxed at rates significantly less than rates applicable to income generated in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions in which we do business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our effective tax rate in the future, and accordingly our results of operations and financial position, could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax law or if more of our income becomes taxable in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our largest stockholder is our Chairman and CEO, George F. Colony, who owns approximately 45% of our outstanding stock.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	This concentration of ownership enables Mr. Colony to strongly influence or effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	This concentration of ownership may also limit the liquidity of our stock.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	As a result, efforts by stockholders to change the direction, management or ownership of Forrester may be unsuccessful, and stockholders may not be able to freely purchase and sell shares of our stock.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Any Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.
1023313_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	There can be no assurance that no weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will occur in future periods, or that any such weakness will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner.
1023313_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We have not received written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission that remain unresolved.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters building is comprised of approximately 190,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, substantially all of which is currently occupied by the Company.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates research, data, marketing, sales, consulting, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Paris, New Delhi, and Singapore.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our San Francisco lease is for approximately 19,000 square feet, with a term that expires June 30, 2022.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our New York lease is for approximately 15,200 square feet, with an initial term until January 31, 2021, with the right to terminate in 2017 with prior notice and payment of designated early termination fees and charges.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S6	The London lease is for approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term that expires September 24, 2021.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S7	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_16_ITEM2_P0_S8	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR .
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	During 2014, quarterly dividends of $0.16 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	During 2015, quarterly dividends of $0.17 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S3	In February 2016 our Board of Directors declared an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share that is payable on March 16, 2016.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S5	As of March 7, 2016 there were approximately 32 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S6	On March 7, 2016 the closing price of our common stock was $32.15 per share.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P0_S7	The following table represents the ranges of high and low sale prices of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:
1023313_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Through 2015, our Board of Directors authorized an aggregate $460.0 million to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program including $25.0 million authorized in each of July 2015, February 2015 and April 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2015 we had repurchased approximately 15.0 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $423.1 million.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	During the quarter ended December 31, 2015 we repurchased the following shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program:
1023313_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	All purchases of our common stock were made under the stock repurchase program first announced in 2001.
1023313_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2015 with the cumulative return during the same period for the Russell 2000 and the S P 600 Small Cap Information Technology Index, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were reinvested.
1023313_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data presented below is derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read in connection with those statements.
1023313_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	Cash dividends in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 represent quarterly dividends of $0.17, $0.16, $0.15 and $0.14 per common share declared and paid during 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1023313_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	The 2013 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes a $1.9 million loss for the sale of the Company s entire portfolio of auction rate securities.
1023313_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	The 2012 net income amount includes a $5.9 million deferred income tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a tax audit at the Company s German subsidiary.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to, and sales of, our Research, Connect and Data products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting events.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our Research, Connect and Data products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Membership revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our subscription-based products.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for all personnel that produce and deliver our products and services, including all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities and annual fees for cloud-based information technology systems are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention, enrichment and number of clients are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Clients we count as a single client the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent and we also aggregate separate instrumentalities of the federal, state, and provincial governments as single clients.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2015 decreased 3% compared to the prior year and on a constant currency basis was flat with the prior year, due to growth in contract bookings being offset by revenue growth and a small increase in future billings for current contracts as of December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Agreement value at December 31, 2015 increased 2% compared to the prior year and on a constant currency basis increased 4%, representing an increase in contract bookings for the year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2014 decreased 5% compared to 2013 and on a constant currency basis decreased 3%, due to growth in contract bookings being offset by revenue growth.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Agreement value at December 31, 2014 increased 7% compared to the prior year on both an actual rate and constant currency basis, due to an increase in contract bookings for the year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	Client retention and dollar retention rates have improved steadily through 2015 compared to 2013 levels.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	The 2013 rates were at multi-year lows due in part to the negative effects from the challenges associated with the implementation of a sales reorganization in early 2012, high sales employee attrition during 2013 and 2012, a difficult selling environment in Europe and weaker demand for our data subscription products in 2013, in part due to the phasing out of our standalone Tech Marketing Navigator data product.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to, and sales of, our Research, Connect and Data products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the amount of revenue that is allocated to our Research, Connect and Data products that commence delivery on the first day of the contract is limited based on the contract price that would be refundable to the customer if the yet undelivered products were never delivered.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We obtain the selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The majority of our research services revenues, including our RoleView Research, Leadership Boards and Data subscription products, are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	Certain research services revenues, including revenues from sales of reprints and our customer experience index, are recognized as revenue when delivered.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services and events revenues.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView R esearch include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, membership i n one or more of our Leadership B oards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Contracts for RoleView Research and Leadership Boards are accounted for as two units of accountin g: 1) the event ticket and 2) the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data advisor, which are delivered throughout the year , and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	Certain of our data subscription products also include advisory services and these contracts are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the data subscription and data advisor and 2) the advisory services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of the advisory services and t he estimated selling price of the remaining data services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Beginning in February 2013, we discontinued our policy of offering our clients a service guarantee.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Service guarantees had provided our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	Furthermore, our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, dividend yields and forfeiture rates.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	Expected dividend yields are based on expectations of current and future dividends, if any.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	We are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense, which we base on past experience and expectations of future forfeitures.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	We will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P26_S4	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P26_S5	If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimates, or if our estimates of forfeitures are modified in a future period, the actual stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $3.6 million at December 31, 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets .
1023313_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2015, we had $76.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	The annual assessment of goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment, or a combination of both.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2015 utilizing a qualitative assessment and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units more likely than not continues to exceed their respective carrying values.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Intangible assets with fini te lives as of December 31, 2015 consist primarily of acquired customer relationships and were valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the pe riods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occ urred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the esti mated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair va lue.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Total revenues increased 1% during 2015 compared to 2014 and on a constant currency basis increased 4%.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. decreased 9% during 2015 compared to the prior year; however after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, revenues from customers outside of the U.S. increased 4% and represented 26% of total revenues in 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	On a constant currency basis, revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region and Europe was partially offset by a decline in Canada.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue primarily on a ratable basis over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	Research services revenues increased 1% during 2015 compared to the prior year and on a constant currency basis increased 5%, reflecting growth in our Research and Data products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Connect products.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	The increase in revenue for our Research and Data products is a result of an increase in related contract bookings in 2015, while the decrease in revenue for our Connect products is a result of a decrease in related contract bookings in 2015, due in part to a reduction in our Connect product offerings outside of the U.S. Revenues from advisory services and events decreased 1% during 2015 compared to the prior year and on a constant currency basis increased 2%.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	The decrease was driven by a 20% decrease in Events revenues due to a significant decrease in sponsorship revenues during 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	The decrease in Events revenues was partially offset by a 2% increase in advisory and consulting revenue in 2015 due to an increase in related contract bookings and delivery of services in 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P40_S5	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and contribution margin results by segment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment expenses increased less than 1% in 2015 compared to 2014 and on a constant currency basis increased 3%.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Total compensation and benefits costs decreased approximately $0.2 million in 2015 compared to the prior year as lower salary and benefit costs, due to fewer employees in 2015, was partially offset by an increase in incentive bonus expense in 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	Of the 50 employees terminated during the reorganization in the first quarter of 2015, 32 of the employees were included in cost of services and fulfillment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	In addition, 2015 includes a $0.3 million increase in stock compensation costs and a $0.2 million increase in Events costs that were partially offset by lower professional service costs due to lower consulting outsourcing costs.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Selling and marketing expenses increased less than 1% in 2015 compared to 2014 and on a constant currency basis increased 3%.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	The increase in selling and marketing expenses during 2015 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in sales employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	In addition, 2015 includes a $0.5 million increase in professional service costs that were offset by lower bad debt expense and a $0.2 million charge to terminate a contract with an independent sales representative during 2014 that did not recur in 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	Of the 50 employees terminated during the reorganization in the first quarter of 2015, 15 of the employees were included in selling and marketing.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	Subject to the business environment, we intend to expand our quota carrying sales force by approximately 1% to 3% in 2016 as compared to 2015 as we anticipate productivity improvements in 2016.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	General and administrative expenses increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014 and on a constant currency basis increased 4%.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2015 compared to the prior year is primarily due to 1) a $1.5 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from an increase in incentive bonus expense and annual merit increases and 2) a $0.6 million increase in stock based compensation expense.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	These increases were partially offset by lower professional services costs due to the implementation of cloud-based software services in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 and a reduction in recruiting costs due to the build out of the consulting organization that was substantially completed in 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased by $1.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	The decrease was due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during 2015 as well as a $0.4 million immaterial out-of-period adjustment recorded during 2014 to correct an understatement error of depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million in each of 2013 and 2012.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense decreased by $1.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 due to a portion of our intangible assets becoming fully amortized at the end of 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S6	Reorganization Costs During 2015 we incurred $3.2 million of severance and related costs from our reorganization in the first quarter of 2015 that included the termination of 50 employees or approximately 4% of our workforce across various geographies and functions, in order to reallocate investment in 2015 to planned sales expansion and to delivery areas seeing the greatest client demand.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P43_S7	We incurred an additional $0.3 million charge in the second quarter of 2015 related to this action primarily for a non-cash charge for the liquidation of a small non-U.S. subsidiary.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	In addition, during the third quarter of 2015 we incurred $0.7 million of severance and related benefits for the reorganization of our Products Group, consisting of the termination of the chief product officer and related administrative staff, and the termination of a senior product leader with the intent to relocate this position to the U.S.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	The responsibiliti es of the former chief product officer have been assumed by our chief research officer.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	As a result of the change in leadership in the Products Group, we incurred an additional $0.2 million of expense to write off a software development project that was n o longer deemed probable to be completed.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	The remaining $0.5 million of the severance and related benefit costs incurred but not paid during 2015 are expected to be paid in 2016.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	During 2014 we incurred $1.8 million of severance and related costs for the termination of approximately 1% of our employees across various geographies and functions primarily to realign resources due to a new organizational structure implemented in late 2013.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	The costs under this plan were substantially paid by the end of 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	In March 2016 we implemented a reduction in our workforce of approximately 2% across various geographies and functions.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	The Company expects to incur pre-tax expenses of $1.0 million to $1.2 million in the first and second quarters of 2016 related principally to severance and related benefit costs for terminated employees.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	Income from Operations Income from operations increased $0.6 million or 3% during 2015 as compared to the prior year and increased to 6.0% of total revenues in 2015 from 5.8% in the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S5	The expansion in income from operations as a percentage of total revenues in 2015 was due to tight cost controls in 2015, as shown by headcount declining to 1,345 at December 31, 2015 from 1,351 employees at December 31, 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S6	The focus on cost controls during 2015 resulted in our operating expenses increasing by less than 1% compared to 2014, which was just under our revenue growth during 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S7	We expect income from operations as a percentage of total revenue to increase to 7.0% to 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to a continued focus on cost control and the cost reductions that are expected from the 2% workforce reduction implemented in March of 2016.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S8	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency and remained essentially consistent during 2015 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P45_S9	Losses on Investments, Net Losses on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains or losses from our technology-related investment funds and gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities, both of which were insignificant during 2015 and 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a one-time $0.6 million benefit in 2015 for a change in tax legislation related to the U.S. Tax Court opinion in the Altera case as described below, and an immaterial out-of-period error recorded in 2014 that increased tax expense by $0.5 million.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The effect of these items were partially offset by the inclusion in 2015 of a $0.3 million loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2015 for which a tax benefit could not be recognized.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	In July 2015 the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The opinion invalidates part of a treasury regulation requiring stock-based compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	We have reviewed this case and concluded that recording a tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2015, representing the benefit of adjusting our cost-sharing agreement for the years of 2012 through 2014, was appropriate based on the opinion in the case.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	The 5% increase in revenues during 2014 compared to 2013 was driven by a 10% increase in advisory services and events revenues while research services revenues increased 2% during the period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Foreign exchange fluctuations had an insignificant effect on total revenue growth during 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	While revenues from customers outside of the U.S. increased 1% during 2014 compared to the prior year, the percentage of revenues attributable to customers outside of the U.S. decreased by less than one percentage point during 2014 compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	Foreign exchange fluctuations had an effect of decreasing foreign revenue growth in 2014 by approximately 1% compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	We experienced stronger growth during 2014 in the U.S. region compared to outside of the U.S. Growth in the Asia Pacific region and Canada was partially offset by a revenue decline (on a constant currency basis) in the European region.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	The general economic conditions in Europe as well as sales leadership challenges contributed to a difficult selling environment in that region.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S6	Research services revenues increased 2% during 2014 compared to the prior year, which is essentially consistent with the related contract bookings growth during this period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S7	Revenues from our Data products declined by approximately $1.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, the majority of which was due to the phasing out of our Tech Marketing Navigator product that began in 2013.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S8	The decline in Data revenues was offset by growth in our Research revenues while our Connect revenues were essentially flat for the year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S9	Revenue from advisory services and events increased 10% during 2014 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S10	The increase was driven by strong growth in advisory and consulting revenues due primarily to strong demand for both advisory and consulting services and an increase in consulting headcount as we completed the build out of a dedicated consulting organization that began in 2013.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P48_S11	Events revenues were flat during 2014 as compared to 2013.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	The increase in cost of services and fulfillment expenses during 2014 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $7.8 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees (consisting of consulting and product specialist employees) and annual merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	We hired additional consulting employees during 2013 and 2014 to build out a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to our clients, allowing our analysts to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term advisory services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, 2014 includes increased costs for stock compensation and travel and entertainment (primarily for billable expenses for consulting projects).
1023313_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	The increase in selling and marketing expenses during 2014 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in sales employees, annual merit increases and increased commission costs resulting from a higher number of sales employees achieving their sales plan, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses during 2014 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from increased headcount and annual merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense, and higher stock compensation costs of $0.7 million.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	These increases were partially offset by lower professional services expenses in 2014 due primarily to lower accounting and legal costs.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Depreciation Depreciation expense during 2014 was essentially consistent with the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	There was a decrease in depreciation during 2014 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during 2014 and this decrease was offset by an increase in depreciation resulting from a $0.4 million immaterial out-of-period adjustment recorded during 2014 to correct an understatement error of depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million in each of 2013 and 2012.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense remained essentially consistent during 2014 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S5	Reorganization Costs During 2014 we incurred $1.8 million of severance and related costs for the termination of approximately 1% of our employees across various geographies and functions primarily to realign resources due to our new organizational structure implemented in late 2013.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S6	The costs under this plan were substantially paid by the end of 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S7	During 2013 we incurred $1.9 million of severance and related costs for the elimination of 31 jobs or approximately 2.5% of our workforce worldwide in an effort to streamline our operations.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S8	Income from Operations Income from operations declined $4.0 million during 2014 as compared to the prior year and declined to 5.8% of total revenues in 2014 from 7.3% in the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P52_S9	Although revenues increased by $14.4 million in 2014, this was offset by a $17.0 million increase in compensation and benefit costs during 2014 from additional headcount investments in our consulting, product and sales organizations and annual merit increases.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The decrease in other income, net during 2014 is primarily due to lower interest income earned in 2014 due to lower investment balances, which was partially offset by lower foreign currency losses in 2014 as compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	Losses on Investments, Net Losses on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains or losses from our technology-related investment funds and gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	In 2014 we realized an approximate $0.4 million loss from our equity method investments primarily from a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds, and realized approximately $0.1 million of gains from other investments.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	During 2013 we sold our portfolio of auction rate securities (par value $11.0 million) for a realized loss of $1.9 million.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	In addition, in 2013 we realized an approximate $0.7 million loss from our equity method investments primarily from a decrease in the valuation of certain assets within the funds, and realized approximately $0.1 million of gains from other investments.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate during 2014 as compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the following: the inclusion in 2013 of foreign tax credits that did not recur in 2014; an immaterial out-of-period error recorded in 2014 that increased tax expense by $0.5 million; a lower foreign tax rate benefit in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a smaller portion of our income being earned outside of the U.S. during 2014, and higher state taxes due to an ongoing state audit that increased tax expense by $0.1 million in 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	These increases were partially offset by a benefit from decreasing our valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses due to the utilization of a portion of these losses in 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Research segment includes the costs of our research personnel who are responsible for writing the research and performing the webinars and inquiries for our Research and Connect products.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	In addition, the research personnel deliver advisory services (such as workshops, speeches and advisory days) and a portion of our project consulting services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Revenue in this segment includes only revenue from advisory services and project consulting services that are delivered by the research personnel in this segment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	During 2013, we began to transition the delivery of project consulting to a dedicated project consulting organization.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	The transition was essentially complete by the end of 2014 such that the vast majority of project consulting has been and will continue to be delivered by the project consulting organization in 2015 and beyond.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Product segment includes the costs of the product management organization that is responsible for product pricing and packaging and the launch of new products.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	In addition, this segment includes the costs of our Data, Connect and Events organizations.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	Revenue in this segment includes all of our revenue (including Research and Connect) except for revenue from advisory services and project consulting services that are delivered by personnel in the Research and Project Consulting segments.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Project Consulting segment includes the costs of the consultants that deliver our project consulting services.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	During 2013 we began to hire dedicated consultants to transition the delivery of project consulting services from research personnel (included in the Research segment) to the new Project Consulting segment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Revenue in this segment includes the project consulting revenue delivered by the consultants in this segment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on segment revenues and expenses.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Segment expenses include the direct expenses of each segment organization and exclude selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation e xpense, depreciation expense, adjustments to incentive bonus compensation from target amounts, amortization of intangible assets, reorganization costs, other income and losses on investments.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as tho se used in the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Product segment revenues were flat during 2015 compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	Research services revenues increased 1% during 2015 compared to the prior year and on a constant currency basis increased 5%, reflecting growth in our Research and Data products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Connect products.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P61_S2	The increase in revenue for our Research and Data products is a result of an increase in related contract bookings in 2015, while the decrease in revenue for our Connect products is a result of a decrease in related contract bookings in 2015, due in part to a reduction in our Connect product offerings outside of the U.S. Advisory services and events revenues decreased $3.2 million during 2015 due primarily to a $2.6 million decrease in events revenues to $10.4 million in the 2015 period compared to $12.9 million during the prior year, driven by a significant decline in sponsorship revenue.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P61_S3	Data advisory revenue decreased $0.7 million or 10% during 2015 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower outsource fees associated with the data consulting projects.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P61_S4	Product segment expenses decreased 2% during 2015 compared to the prior year periods, and on a constant currency basis were essentially flat.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P61_S5	The decline on a dollar basis was due to a decline in compensation and benefits costs due to lower headcount that was only partially offset by an increase in professional services expense for surveys.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Product segment revenues increased 3% during 2014 compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Research services revenues increased 2% during 2014 compared to the prior year, which is essentially consistent with the related contract bookings growth during this period.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	Revenues from our Data products declined by approximately $1.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, the majority of which was due to the phasing out of our Tech Marketing Navigator product that began in 2013.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	The decline in Data revenues was offset by growth in our Research revenues while our Connect revenues remained essentially flat.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Events revenues were $12.9 million during 2014 which were flat compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	Data advisory revenues increased approximately $1.3 million in 2014 compared to the prior year, representing growth of 20%.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P62_S6	Product segment expenses increased 8% during 2014 due primarily to a $3.1 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due to an increase in the number of employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Research segment revenues decreased 12% and 16% during 2015 and 2014 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods , due to the transition of the performance of project consulting services during 2015 and 2014 from personnel in our Research segment to personnel in our Project Consulting segment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	Research segmen t expenses decreased by 3% and 9% during 2015 and 2014 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods, due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in the number of employees in the Research se gment related to the tran sition in the delivery of project consulting services to the Project Consulting segment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	Project Consulting segment revenues increased 22% and 100% during 2015 and 2014, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, due primarily to the transition of the performance of project consulting services from research personnel in our Research segment to consulting personnel during 2015 and 2014.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	Project Consulting segment expenses were flat during 2015 and increased 73% during 2014 compared to the prior year periods.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	The flat expenses during 2015 were due primarily to a $0.5 million increase in salaries and benefits that was offset by a decrease in outsourced costs.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	The 73% increase in expenses during 2014 was due primarily to a $10.0 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due to an increase in the number of employees and annual merit increases.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	Research services revenues, which constituted approximately 67% of our revenues during 2015, are generally renewable annually and are typically payable in advance.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $32.5 million and $28.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	The $3.7 million increase in cash provided from operations during 2015 is primarily attributable to a $7.8 million decrease in cash paid for income taxes during 2015 due to a decrease in the current component of income tax expense compared to 2014, partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease in cash generated from the change in accounts receivable and deferred revenue in 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to an increase in unbilled amounts on contracts at December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	During 2015 we generated $2.8 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $6.4 million in net maturities of marketable investments partially offset by $3.9 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Property and equipment purchases during 2015 consisted primarily of equipment and software.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $3.0 million to $5.0 million during 2016.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	During 2014 we generated $24.8 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $24.7 million in net maturities of marketable investments and $1.5 million of distributions from our non-marketable investments, partially offset by $1.5 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	Property and equipment purchases during 2014 consisted primarily of software.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	We regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations of investment grade.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	We used $29.7 million of cash from financing activities during 2015 primarily due to $20.9 million of purchases of our common stock.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	In addition, during 2015 we paid $12.2 million of quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.17 per share dividend each quarter and we received $3.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S3	We used $75.9 million of cash from financing activities during 2014 primarily due to $73.2 million of purchases of our common stock.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S4	In addition, during 2014 we paid $12.0 million of quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.16 per share dividend each quarter and we received $9.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S5	During 2015 our Board of Directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by $50 million.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S6	As of December 31, 2015 our remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $36.9 million.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S7	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $53.3 million and marketable investments of $47.8 million.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S8	These balances include $37.3 million held outside of the U.S.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S9	If these funds outside of the U.S. are needed for operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S10	However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S11	We do not currently have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future except in the case of a significant acquisition.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S12	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P66_S13	As of December 31, 2015, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	As of December 31, 2015 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was $1.9 million and was included in non-current liabilities.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	These amounts were not included in the table above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities during the course of the year, which may include U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio, for which all of the securities are denominated in U.S. dollar.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Principal amounts by maturity dates (dollars in thousands):
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P7_S2	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Foreign exchange losses were insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements as we have assessed our exposure to sudden changes in foreign currency exchange rates to be insignificant.
1023313_16_ITEM7A_P8_S3	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro, British pound or other foreign currencies.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements listed in the following Index to Financial Statements are filed as a part of this 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.:
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the classification of deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1023313_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is a global independent research, data, and advisory services firm.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Forrester works with business and technology leaders to help them develop customer-obsessed strategies that drive growth.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	Forrester s unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 500,000 consumers and business leaders worldwide, rigorous and objective research methodologies, and the shared wisdom of our clients.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Through proprietary research and data, custom consulting, exclusive executive peer groups and events, Forrester challenges the thinking of its clients and positions them to lead change in their organizations.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S4	Out-of-Period Errors During 2014 the Company recorded $0.3 million of pre-tax expenses ($0.2 million post tax) for out-of-period corrections, of which $0.4 million related to depreciation and $(0.1) million related to other immaterial amounts that related to prior periods.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S5	In addition, during 2014 the Company recorded $0.5 million of additional income tax expense for an out-of-period correction.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P12_S6	The Company has concluded that these items are immaterial to the 2014 and prior period financial statements.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as either Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company s portfolio of investments may at any time include securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	Forrester accounts for all marketable investments as available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P16_S3	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary i mpairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for- sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other compre hensive loss .
1023313_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company inte nds to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P18_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not record any ot her-t han-temporary impairment losses on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no off-balance sheet or significant concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.

1023313_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.

1023313_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data advisor, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Certain of the data subscription products also include advisory services and these contracts are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the data subscription and data advisor and 2) the advisory services.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of the advisory services and the estimated selling price of the remaining data services.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	For all contracts entered into through January 2013, clients were offered a service guarantee, which gave them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services.

1023313_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	In July 2015 the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The opinion invalidates part of a trea sury regulation requiring stock-based compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	We have reviewed this case and concluded that recording a tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2015, representing the benefit of adjusti ng our cost-sharing agreement for the years of 2012 through 2014, was appropriate based on the opinion in the case.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	This benefit is included in t he change in tax legislation line in the table above.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P67_S4	We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and pote ntial impacts to our consolidated financial statements.

1023313_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	Each tax jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	The Company adopted the new standard as of December 31, 2015.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P69_S4	Deferred tax assets and liabilities for all years prior to 2015 continue to be classified under the prior standard that required net deferred taxes to be classified as either current and noncurrent based on the guidelines in the prior standard.

1023313_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_16_ITEM8_P70_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.

1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment that involves risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: A Decline in Renewals or Demand for Our Membership-Based Research and Data Services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our Research, Data, and Leadership Boards products and services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment, or failure to generate demand for and new sales of our membership-based products and services due to competition or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Demand for Our Advisory and Consulting Services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Advisory and consulting services revenues comprised 31% of our total revenues in 2016 and 30% in 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Consulting engagements generally are project-based and non-recurring.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S8	A decline in our ability to fulfill existing or generate new project consulting engagements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S9	We Are Evolving Our Customer Engagement Model.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S10	We are implementing changes to our customer engagement model toward a model where we provide different sales engagement and support levels for clients and prospects in our Premier and Core sales groups.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S11	These changes are designed to improve our retention and enrichment rates and accelerate growth.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If the changes we are implementing do not have the desired outcomes, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our Business May be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	If conditions in the United States and the global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our products and services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We have clients in approximately 56 countries and approximately 23% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients sourced by the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a number of our key management employees.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We Have Undergone Substantial Internal Reorganizations.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Beginning in 2013, we began to transition the provision of consulting services from our research personnel to consultants in our dedicated consulting organization and have hired additional consulting employees to build out this organization.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P3_S7	At the same time, we hired additional quota carrying sales employees.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	research and product organizations into a global o rganization headed by a Chief Research and Product officer.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In 2016, we began to implement changes to our customer engagement model.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We have incurred material expenses in connection with these actions.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we do not realize anticipated benefits from these a ctions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely effected.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research and data professionals, consultants, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our future success will also depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research, data, advisory services, and other related products and services to meet the changing needs of our clients.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We compete principally in the market for research, data and advisory services, with an emphasis on customer behavior and customer experience, and the impact of business technology on our clients business and service models.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our principal direct competitors include other independent providers of research and advisory services, such as Gartner, as well as marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, survey-based general market research firms, providers of peer networking services, and digital media measurement services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our indirect competitors could choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain segments of our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more of these market segments.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S8	There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Failure to Enforce and Protect our Intellectual Property Rights.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S10	We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Unauthorized third parties may obtain or use our proprietary information despite our efforts to protect it.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S12	The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States and accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use or distribution, which could adversely affect our business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S13	Privacy laws and regulations, and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations, in the U.S, Europe and other countries around the world where we conduct business are sometimes inconsistent and frequently changing.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P10_S14	Compliance with these laws, or changing interpretations and application of these laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to take action in a manner that would be adverse to our business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Trends in technology and research, data and advisory services spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our products and services from clients.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The hiring and training of new research and data professionals, consultants, and sales personnel.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Changes in demand for our research, data and advisory services.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research, data and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A portion of our income is generated outside of the United States and is taxed at rates significantly less than rates applicable to income generated in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions in which we do business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our effective tax rate in the future, and accordingly our results of operations and financial position, could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax law or if more of our income becomes taxable in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our largest stockholder is our Chairman and CEO, George F. Colony, who owns approximately 44% of our outstanding stock.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	This concentration of ownership enables Mr. Colony to strongly influence or effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	This concentration of ownership may also limit the liquidity of our stock.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As a result, efforts by stockholders to change the direction, management or ownership of Forrester may be unsuccessful, and stockholders may not be able to freely purchase and sell shares of our stock.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.
1023313_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	There can be no assurance that no weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will occur in future periods, or that any such weakness will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner.
1023313_17_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We have not received written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission that remain unresolved.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters building is comprised of approximately 190,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, substantially all of which is currently occupied by the Company.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates research, data, marketing, sales, consulting, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Paris, New Delhi, and Singapore.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our San Francisco lease is for approximately 19,000 square feet, with a term that expires June 30, 2022.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our New York lease is for approximately 15,200 square feet, with an initial term until January 31, 2021.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S6	The London lease is for approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term that expires September 24, 2021.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P0_S7	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our cu rrent needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
1023313_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR .

1023313_17_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_17_ITEM5_P0_S5	As of March 6, 2017 there were approximately 31 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_17_ITEM5_P0_S6	On March 6, 2017 the closing price of our common stock was $36.80 per share.

1023313_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	All purchases of our common stock were made under the stock repurchase program first announced in 2001.
1023313_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during t he period from December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2016 wi th the cumulative return during the same period for the Russell 2000 and the S P 600 Small Cap Information Technology Index, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were reinvested.
1023313_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data presented below is derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read in connection with those statements.
1023313_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	Cash dividends in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 represent quarterly dividends of $0.18, $0.17, $0.16, $0.15 and $0.14 per common share declared and paid during 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1023313_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	The 2013 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes a $1.9 million loss for the sale of the Company s entire portfolio of auction rate securities.
1023313_17_ITEM6_P4_S0	The 2012 net income amount includes a $5.9 million deferred income tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a tax audit at the Company s German subsidiary.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to, and sales of, our Research, Connect and Data products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting events.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our Research, Connect and Data products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	Membership revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our subscription-based products.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for all personnel that produce and deliver our products and services, including all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities and annual fees for cloud-based information technology systems are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention, enrichment and number of clients are metrics that we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	No single client accounted for more than 2% of agreement value at December 31, 2016.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dollar retention the total dollar value of client membership contracts expiring during the most recent twelve-month period, which are renewed in whole or in part, as a percentage of the dollar value of all expiring client membership contracts during the same period.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Clients we aggregate the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent as a single client and we also aggregate separate instrumentalities of the federal, state, and provincial governments as single clients.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2016 decreased 5% compared to the prior year and decreased 4% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, due to our revenue growth for the year exceeding contract bookings.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Agreement value at December 31, 2016 increased 1% compared to the prior year and increased 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, representing an increase in contract bookings for the year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2015 decreased 3% compared to the prior year and was flat with the prior year after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, due to growth in contract bookings being offset by revenue growth and a small increase in future billings for current contracts as of December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Agreement value at December 31, 2015 increased 2% compared to the prior year and 4% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, representing an increase in contract bookings for the year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	Client retention and dollar retention rates improved steadily during 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	However, these metrics have shown a small decline in each quarter from the fourth quarter of 2015 throughout 2016.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S6	Our enrichment metric remained at 97% throughout 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015, and increased to 98% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P12_S7	During 2016, our enrichment metric declined each quarter throughout the year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-7.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to, and sales of, our Research, Connect and Data products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the amount of revenue that is allocated to our Research, Connect and Data products that commence delivery on the first day of the contract is limited based on the contract price that would be refundable to the customer if the yet undelivered products were never delivered.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We obtain the relative selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year or upon an analysis of the estimated selling price of products for which there are insufficient standalone sales.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	The majority of our research services revenues, including our RoleView Research, Leadership Boards and Data subscription products, are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	Certain research services revenues, including revenues from sales of reprints, are recognized as revenue when delivered.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P19_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P19_S5	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services and events revenues.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Annual subscriptions to our RoleView R esearch include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of license, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, and unlimited partic ipation in Forrester Webinars, all of which are delivered throughout the contract period and are accounted for as one unit of accounting .
1023313_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Annual subscriptions for Leadershi p Boards include access to the RoleView Research offering, access to a private forum with other Leadership Board member peers, acc ess to a Forrester advisor, member-generated content, and one Event ticket.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Leadership Boards are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the event tick et and 2) the remaining services that are delivered throughout the contract period.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Arrangement con sideration is allocated to each e lement based upon their relative selling price s, which are determined based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining services.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Annual subscriptions to our data subscription produ cts include access to designated survey data products and access to a data advisor, which a re delivered throughout the contract period , and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research serv ices revenue over the contract period.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	Certain of our data subscription products also include advisory services and these contracts are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1) the data subscription and data advisor and 2) the advisory services.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocat ed to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of the advisory services and the estimated selling price of the remaining data services.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our revenue recognition also determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	The determination of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility, expected option lives, dividend yields and forfeiture rates.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	As a result, if circumstances change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors (expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates).
1023313_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Expected dividend yields are based on expectations of current and future dividends, if any.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	For periods through December 31, 2016, we were required to estimate forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	We based these estimates on past experience and expectations of future forfeitures.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	We recorded additional expense if the actual forfeitures were lower than estimated and recorded a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures were higher than estimated.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	The actual expense recognized over the vesting period is only for those awards that vested.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of January 1, 2017, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update ( ASU) No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
1023313_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Under this standard, entities are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures, as previously required, or to recognize forfeitures as they occur.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	We will elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur, effective January 1, 2017, and as such will record expense over the service period for 100% of our share-based awards that are outstanding and not yet vested and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense at the date an award is forfeited prior to vesting.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	Significant forfeitures during a reporting period could increase the volatility, and decrease the predictability, of our financial results.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $2.8 million at December 31, 2016.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in their value occurs.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets .
1023313_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had $74.7 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30th as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The annual assessment of goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment, or a combination of both.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	significantly exceed their respective carrying values.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated wi th our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives as of December 31, 2016 consist primarily of acquired customer relationships and were valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P39_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P39_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P39_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Total revenues increased 4% during 2016 compared to 2015 and 5% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. increased 2% during 2016 compared to the prior year and 6% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, representing 23% of total revenues in 2016 and reflecting growth in the Asia Pacific region and in Europe while revenues in Canada declined slightly.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	We expect consolidated revenue growth to slow to a range of negative 1% to growth of 2% in 2017, or growth of 1% to 3% after adjusting for the effect of estimated currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	The decline in our estimated revenue growth rate in 2017 compared to the actual growth rate in 2016 is due primarily to lower contract bookings growth in 2016 compared to the prior year, which was due primarily to keeping the number of quota carrying sales employees essentially flat during 2016 compared to a 5% increase during 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	We anticipate increasing our sales employees by 8% to 10% during 2017, which we expect will accelerate revenue growth towards the end of 2017.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue primarily on a ratable basis over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Research services revenues increased 2% during 2016 compared to the prior year and 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, reflecting growth in our Research products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Connect and Data products.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Revenues from advisory services and events increased 7% during 2016 compared to the prior year and 8% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	The increase was led by growth in our Consulting and Advisory services of 7% while our Events business achieved growth of 4%.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and contribution margin results by segment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment expenses increased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to (1) a $1.2 million increase in compensation and benefit costs, resulting from an increase in the average number of employees and annual merit increases compared to the prior year and (2) a $2.3 million increase in professional services costs due to an increase in outsourced fees related to consulting projects delivered and an increase in fees related to the new digital reprint platform, which were partially offset by a decrease in survey costs.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	These increases were partially offset by a reduction in event expenses of $0.9 million and a reduction in travel expenses of $0.7 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	We anticipate an increase in cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of revenues in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to revenues estimated at near flat levels and costs increasing due to an increase in hiring of consulting employees and merit increases.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Selling and marketing expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in sales employees and annual merit increases compared to the prior year, which were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in professional services costs.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	During 2016 we commenced work to evolve our customer engagement model to better serve and engage our clients and prospects.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Our sales process is moving towards a model where we provide different sales engagement and support levels for clients and prospects in our Premier and Core groups.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	As we began this transition during 2016, sales headcount growth was limited as we transitioned our clients and salesforce into this new model on a limited basis.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	We intend to fully implement this model during 2017 and plan to increase our sales employees by approximately 8% to 10% in 2017 as compared to 2016.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	Any resulting increase in contract bookings for our research services would generally be recognized over a twelve-month period, which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues during periods of sales force expansion.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	General and administrative expenses increased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 5% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in professional services expense resulting primarily from an increase in consulting fees for technology projects and legal and accounting expenses.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Depreciation Depreciation expense remained essentially consistent in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense remained essentially consistent in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	Reorganization Costs During 2016 we incurred $1.0 million of severance and related benefits costs for a reduction in our workforce implemented and completed in the first quarter of 2016, of approximately 2% of employees across various geographies and functions.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	All costs under this plan were paid during 2016.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S6	During 2015 we incurred $3.2 million of severance and related costs from our reorganization in the first quarter of 2015 that included the termination of 50 employees or approximately 4% of our workforce across various geographies and functions, in order to reallocate investment in 2015 to planned sales expansion and to delivery areas seeing the greatest client demand.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P46_S7	We incurred an additional $0.3 million charge in the second quarter of 2015 related to this action primarily for a non-cash charge for the liquidation of a small non-U.S. subsidiary.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	In addition, during the third q uarter of 2015 we incurred $0.7 million of severance and related benefits for the reorganization of our Products Group, consisting of the termination of the chief product officer and related administrative staff, and the termination of a senior product lea der with the intent to relocate this position to the U.S.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The responsibilities of the former chief product officer have been assumed by our chief research officer.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	As a result of the change in leadership in the Products Group, we incurred an additional $ 0.2 million of expense to write off a software development project that was no longer deemed probable to be completed.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	Income from Operations Income from operations increased $11.9 million or 63% during 2016 as compared to the prior year and increased to 9.4% of total revenues in 2016 from 6.0% in the prior year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	The expansion in income from operations as a percentage of total revenues in 2016 was due to a small increase in headcount during the year, tight cost controls for travel and entertainment, and a $3.4 million decrease in reorganization costs in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S5	The focus on cost controls during 2016 along with the decrease in reorganization costs resulted in our operating expenses increasing by less than 1% compared to 2015, while revenues increased 4% compared to 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P47_S6	We expect income from operations as a percentage of total revenues to decrease to a range of 7.8% to 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to revenues at flat levels in 2017 compared to 2016 and operating expenses increasing primarily from anticipated increases in headcount for sales and consulting employees.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in other income, net during 2016 was due to 1) an increase in interest income of $0.1 million as compared to 2015 and 2) foreign currency gains of approximately $0.1 million during the current year versus insignificant foreign currency losses during the prior year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Losses on Investments, Net Losses on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains or losses from our technology-related investment funds and gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in investment losses during 2016 was primarily due to an increase in investment losses incurred by the underlying funds as compared to the prior year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate during 2016 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to 1) $1.0 million of tax expense in 2016 due to a valuation allowance on capital losses generated from one of our non-marketable investments and 2) a one-time $0.6 million benefit in 2015, which did not recur in 2016, from a change in tax legislation related to the U.S. Tax Court opinion in the Altera case as described below.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The effect of these items were partially offset by the inclusion in 2015 of a $0.3 million loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2015 for which a tax benefit could not be recognized and lower non-deductible stock compensation expense in 2016 compared to 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	We expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2017 to be approximately 36%, which includes a 4% benefit from the anticipated recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.1 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
1023313_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	ASU No. 2016-09 requires that all income tax effects related to settlements of share-based payment awards be reported in earnings as an increase or decrease to income tax expense.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	The requirement to report those income tax effects in earnings will be applied on a prospective basis to settlements occurring on or after January 1, 2017 and the impact of applying this guidance will be dependent on how many options are exercised and how many restricted stock units vest, as well as the volatility of our stock price.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	In July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	The opinion invalidates part of a treasury regulation requiring stock-based compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	the years of 2012 through 2014, was appropriate based on the opinion in the case.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	There were no significant developments in this case during 2016 and we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Total revenues increased 1% during 2015 compared to 2014 and 4% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. decreased 9% during 2015 compared to the prior year; however after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, revenues from customers outside of the U.S. increased 4% and represented 26% of total revenues in 2015, reflecting revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region and Europe partially offset by a decline in Canada.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	Research services revenues increased 1% during 2015 compared to the prior year and 5% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, reflecting growth in our Research and Data products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Connect products.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	The increase in revenue for our Research and Data products is a result of an increase in related contract bookings in 2015, while the decrease in revenue for our Connect products is a result of a decrease in related contract bookings in 2015, due in part to a reduction in our Connect product offerings outside of the U.S. Revenues from advisory services and events decreased 1% during 2015 compared to the prior year and increased 2% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S4	The decrease was driven by a 20% decrease in Events revenues due to a significant decrease in sponsorship revenues during 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S5	The decrease in Events revenues was partially offset by a 2% increase in Advisory and Consulting revenues in 2015 due to an increase in related contract bookings and delivery of services in 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P54_S6	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and contribution margin results by segment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment expenses increased less than 1% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Total compensation and benefits costs decreased approximately $0.2 million in 2015 compared to the prior year as lower salary and benefit costs, due to fewer employees in 2015, was partially offset by an increase in incentive bonus expense in 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	Of the 50 employees terminated during the reorganization in the first quarter of 2015, 32 of the employees were included in cost of services and fulfillment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	In addition, 2015 includes a $0.3 million increase in stock compensation costs and a $0.2 million increase in Events costs that were partially offset by lower professional service costs due to lower consulting outsourcing costs.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Selling and marketing expenses increased less than 1% in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase in selling and marketing expenses during 2015 compared to the prior year is primarily due to a $0.3 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in sales employees and annual merit increases.

1023313_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	These increases were partially offset by lower professional services costs due to the implementation of cloud-based software services in 2014 that did not recur in 2015 and a reduction in recruiting costs due to the build out of the consulting organization that was substantially completed in 2014.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased by $1.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	The decrease was due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during 2015 as well as a $0.4 million immaterial out-of-period adjustment recorded during 2014 to correct an understatement error of depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million in each of 2013 and 2012.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense decreased by $1.3 million during 2015 compared to 2014 due to a portion of our intangible assets becoming fully amortized at the end of 2014.

1023313_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	been assumed by our chief research officer.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	As a result of the change in l eadership in the Products Group, we incurred an additional $0.2 million of expense to write off a software development project that was no longer deemed probable to be completed.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	During 2014 we incurred $1.8 million of severance and related costs for the termination of approximately 1% of our employees across various geographies and functions primarily to realign resources due to a new organizational structure implemented in late 2013.

1023313_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	The expansion in income from operations as a percentage of total revenues in 2015 was due to tight cost controls in 2015, as shown by headcount declining to 1,345 at December 31, 2015 from 1,351 employees at December 31, 2014.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P58_S5	The focus on cost controls during 2015 resulted in our operating expenses increasing by less than 1% compared to 2014, which was just under our revenue growth during 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P58_S6	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency and remained essentially consistent during 2015 as compared to the prior year.

1023313_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The decrease in the effective tax rate during 2015 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a one-time $0.6 million benefit in 2015 for a change in tax legislation related to the U.S. Tax Court opinion in the Altera case, and an immaterial out-of-period error recorded in 2014 that increased tax expense by $0.5 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The effect of these items were partially offset by the inclusion in 2015 of a $0.3 million loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2015 for which a tax benefit could not be recognized.

1023313_17_ITEM7_P65_S4	Event costs decreased by $0.9 million in 2016, which were mostly offset by small increases in professional services expenses and multiple other expense items.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Product segment revenues were flat during 2015 compared to the prior year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	Research services revenues increased 1% during 2015 compared to the prior year and after adjusting for the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, increased 5% reflecting growth in our Research and Data products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Connect products.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	The increase in revenue for our Research and Data products is a result of an increase in related contract bookings in 2015, while the decrease in revenue for our Connect products is a result of a decrease in related contract bookings in 2015, due in part to a reduction in our Connect product offerings outside of the U.S. Advisory services and events revenues decreased $3.2 million during 2015 due primarily to a $2.6 million decrease in events revenues to $10.4 million in the 2015 period compared to $12.9 million during the prior year, driven by a significant decline in sponsorship revenue.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Data advisory revenue decreased $0.7 million, or 10%, during 2015 compared to the prior year due primarily to lower outsource fees associated with the data consulting projects.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P66_S4	Product segment expenses decreased 2% during 2015 compared to the prior year periods, and on a constant currency basis were essentially flat.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P66_S5	The decline on a dollar basis was due to a decline in compensation and benefits costs due to lower headcount that was only partially offset by an increase in professional services expense for surveys.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Research segment revenues incr eased 6% during 2016 c o mpared to the prior year due to an increase in both advisory and consulting revenues .
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	Research segment expenses decreased by 1 % co mpared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in travel expenses while compensation and benefit costs were flat .
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	Research segment revenues decreased 12% during 2015 compared to the prior year due to the transition of the performance of project consulting services during 2014 and 2015 from personnel in our Research segment to personnel in our Project Consulting segment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	Research segment expenses decreased by 3% during 2015 compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in the number of employees in the Research segment related to the transition in the delivery of project consulting services to the Project Consulting segment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S4	Project Consulting segment revenues increased 5% during 2016 compared to the prior year as our content marketing group delivered strong revenue growth while our strategy consulting group experienced a decline in revenues.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S5	Project Consulting segment expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 2%, during 2016 compared to the prior year due primarily to a $1.9 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a lower number of employees during 2016, which was partially offset by an increase in outsourced costs for consulting projects delivered.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S6	We anticipate increasing the number of consulting employees during 2017.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S7	Project Consulting segment revenues increased 22% during 2015 compared to the prior year, due primarily to the transition of the performance of project consulting services from research personnel in our Research segment to consulting personnel during 2014 and 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S8	Project Consulting segment expenses were flat during 2015 compared to the prior year.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P67_S9	The flat expenses during 2015 were due primarily to a $0.5 million increase in salaries and benefits that was offset by a decrease in outsourced costs.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Research services revenues, which constituted approximately 66% of our revenues during 2016, are generally renewable annually and are typically payable in advance.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $41.9 million and $32.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	The $9.4 million increase in cash provided from operations during 2016 is primarily attributable to 1) an $8.6 million increase in net income as adjusted for non-cash items in 2016 as compared to 2015, 2) a $5.7 million increase in cash generated from the change in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which represents an excess of cash collected compared to revenues during 2016 versus revenues exceeding cash collections during 2015, and 3) a $4.9 million decrease in cash from working capital due primarily to an increase in incentive bonus payments during 2016.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S4	We expect cash from operating activities to be in the range of $32.0 to $36.0 million during 2017.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S5	During 2016, we used $17.9 million of cash for investing activities, consisting primarily of $13.7 million in net purchases of marketable investments and $4.1 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S6	Property and equipment purchases during 2016 consisted primarily of software.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S7	We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $4.0 million to $7.0 million during 2017.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S8	During 2015, we generated $2.8 million of cash from investing activities, consisting primarily of $6.4 million in net maturities of marketable investments partially offset by $3.9 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S9	Property and equipment purchases during 2015 consisted primarily of equipment and software.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S10	We regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations of investment grade.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S11	We generated $2.5 million of cash from financing activities during 2016 primarily due to $16.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, which was partially offset by the payment of $13.0 million in quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.18 per share dividend each quarter.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S12	In addition, during 2016 we paid $1.8 million for purchases of our common stock.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S13	We used $29.7 million of cash from financing activities during 2015 primarily due to $20.9 million of purchases of our common stock.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S14	In addition, during 2015 we paid $12.2 million of quarterly dividends consisting of a $0.17 per share dividend each quarter and we received $3.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S15	During 2016, our Board of Directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by $25 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S16	As of December 31, 2016, our remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $60.1 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S17	We plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during 2017, as market conditions warrant.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S18	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $77.0 million and marketable investments of $61.1 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S19	These balances include $46.3 million held outside of the U.S.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S20	If these funds outside of the U.S. are needed for operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P68_S21	However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requiremen ts for the next twelve months.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	(1) Operating leases comprise of future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable property leases.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	(2) Purchase commitments principally comprise of contractual commitments for software, outsourced research services and event venues.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	As of December 31, 2016, $0.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was included in non-current liabilities.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	These amounts were not included in the table above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities during the course of the year, which may include U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio, for which all of the securities are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Principal amounts by maturity dates (dollars in thousands):
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P7_S2	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred foreign currency exchange gains of $0.1 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Foreign exchange losses were insignificant during the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $0.1 million.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements as we have assessed our exposure to sudden changes in foreign currency exchange rates to be insignificant.
1023313_17_ITEM7A_P8_S3	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro, British pound or other foreign currencies.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements listed in the following Index to Financial Statements are filed as a part of this 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.:
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P1_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

1023313_17_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is a global independent research, data, and advisory services firm.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Forrester works with business and technology leaders to help them develop customer-obsessed strategies that drive growth.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	Forrester s unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 500,000 consumers and business leaders worldwide, rigorous and objective research methodologies, and the shared wisdom of our clients.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	Through proprietary research and data, custom consulting, exclusive executive peer groups and events, Forrester challenges the thinking of its clients and positions them to lead change in their organizations.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as either Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Company s portfolio of investments may at any time include securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	Forrester accounts for all marketable investments as available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P15_S3	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P15_S4	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no off-balance sheet or significant concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30th as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	Impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Non-Current Liabilities The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as non-current liabilities.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	The non-current deferred rent liability at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $7.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, and results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Company s facility leases.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The functional currency of the majority of Forrester s wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currency.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	These subsidiary financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Gains and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P25_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2014, Forrester recorded $0.1 million of foreign exchange gains and $0.1 million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P25_S4	Foreign exchange losses were insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in thousands):
1023313_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Reclassification adjustments for net investment gains (losses) are reported in losses on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

1023313_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	The Company has reviewed this case and concluded that recording a tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2015, representing the benefit of adjusting its cost-sharing agreement for the years of 2012 through 2014, was appropriate based on the opinion in the case.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P80_S3	This benefit is included in the change in tax legislation line in the table above.

1023313_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $2.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively, primarily relating to U.S. capital losses from the Company s investment in a technology-related private equity fund, and from foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition.

1023313_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	If unused, these carryforwards would expire in 2020.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P84_S4	The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20.4 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P84_S5	Approximately $3.5 million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P84_S6	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $3.4 million, of which $0.4 million expires in 2018, $1.6 million expires in 2020 and $1.4 million expires in 2021.

1023313_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the business.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, the amount of taxes attributable to the undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company utilizes a two-step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return.
1023313_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	The first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial statements.

1023313_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
1023313_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.
1023313_17_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment that involves risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: A Decline in Renewals or Demand for Our Membership-Based Research, Connect and Analytics Services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our success depends in large part upon retaining (on both a client company and dollar basis) and enriching existing memberships for our Research, Connect, and Analytics products and services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Future declines in client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment, or failure to generate demand for and new sales of our membership-based products and services due to competition or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	Demand for Our Advisory and Consulting Services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Advisory and consulting services revenues comprised 32% of our total revenues in 2017 and 31% in 2016.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Consulting engagements generally are project-based and non-recurring.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P0_S8	A decline in our ability to fulfill existing or generate new project consulting engagements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We Have Undergone Substantial Internal Reorganization.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	As part of our Age of the Customer strategy, we have implemented significant sales and other organizational change.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our customer engagement model is moving towards a model where we provide different sales engagement and support levels for clients and prospects in our Premier and Core Groups.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	These changes are designed to improve our retention and enrichment rates and accelerate growth.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In 2017, we substantially completed the roll-out of the new model in North America, and we plan to extend it to our European and Asia Pacific Groups in 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	We have incurred material expenses in connection with these actions.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	If the changes we are implementing do not have the desired outcomes, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our Business May be Adversely Affected by the Economic Environment.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is in part dependent on technology spending and is impacted by economic conditions.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The economic environment may materially and adversely affect demand for our products and services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If conditions in the United States and the global economy were to lead to a decrease in technology spending, or in demand for our products and services, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Operational Risks which Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	We have clients in approximately 60 countries and approximately 23% of our revenue comes from international sales.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities, including challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable, and protecting intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Furthermore, we rely on local independent sales representatives in some international locations.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P2_S8	If any of these arrangements are terminated by our representatives or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients sourced by the local sales representative may not want to continue to do business with us or our new representative.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Ability to Develop and Offer New Products and Services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer new products and services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These new products and services must successfully gain market acceptance by anticipating and identifying changes in client requirements and changes in the technology industry and by addressing specific industry and business organization sectors.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The process of internally researching, developing, launching and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service, or assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service, is risky and costly.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We may not be able to introduce new, or assimilate acquired, products or services successfully.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Our failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to grow our business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our future success will depend in large part upon the continued services of a n umber of our key management employees.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The loss of any one of them, in particular George F. Colony, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, could adversely affect our business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Professional Staff.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our future success will depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team, research and data professionals, consultants, and experienced sales and marketing personnel.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Thus, our future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to retain the services of these individuals and to attract additional professionals from a limited pool of qualified candidates.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our future success will also depend in part upon the effectiveness of our sales leadership in hiring and retaining sales personnel and in improving sales productivity.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We experience competition in hiring and retaining professionals from developers of Internet and emerging-technology products, other research firms, management consulting firms, print and electronic publishing companies and financial services companies, many of which have substantially greater ability, either through cash or equity, to attract and compensate professionals.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Failure to Anticipate and Respond to Market Trends.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt our research, data, advisory services, and other related products and services to meet the changing needs of our clients.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The technology and commerce sectors that we analyze undergo frequent and often dramatic changes.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our clients with current and timely analysis, strategies and advice on issues of importance to them.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Meeting these challenges requires the commitment of substantial resources.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Any failure to continue to provide insightful and timely analysis of developments, technologies, and trends in a manner that meets market needs could have an adverse effect on our market position and results of operations.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We May be Subject to Network Disruptions or Security Breaches that Could Damage Our Reputation and Harm Our Business and Operating Results.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	We may be subject to network disruptions or security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, acts of vandalism by third parties or terrorism.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We compete principally in the market for research, data and advisory services, with an emphasis on customer behavior and customer experience, and the impact of business technology on our clients business and service models.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our principal direct competitors include other independent providers of research and advisory services, such as Gartner, as well as marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, survey-based general market research firms, providers of peer networking services, and digital media measurement services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our indirect competitors could choose to compete directly against us in the future.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain segments of our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more of these market segments.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Failure to Enforce and Protect our Intellectual Property Rights.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S10	We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S11	Unauthorized third parties may obtain or use our proprietary information despite our efforts to protect it.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S12	The laws of certain countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States and accordingly we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized use or distribution, which could adversely affect our business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S13	Privacy laws and regulations, and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations, in the U.S, Europe and other countries around the world where we conduct business are sometimes inconsistent and frequently changing.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P10_S14	For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has an enforcement commencement date of May 25, 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Compliance with these laws, or changing interpretations and application of these laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to take action in a manner that would be adverse to our business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our revenues and earnings may fluctua te from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may affect our stock price.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These factors include, but are not limited to:
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Trends in technology and research, data and advisory services spending in the marketplace and general economic conditions.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The timing and size of new and renewal memberships for our products and services from clients.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The utilization of our advisory services by our clients.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The timing of revenue-generating events sponsored by us.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The introduction and marketing of new products and services by us and our competitors.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The hiring and training of new research and data professionals, consultants, and sales personnel.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Changes in demand for our research, data and advisory services.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As a result, our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could have an adverse effect on the market price for our common stock.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Factors such as announcements of new products, services, offices, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, our competitors, or in the research, data and professional services industries generally, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The market price for our common stock may also be affected by movements in prices of stocks in general.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	A portion of our income is generated outside of the United States and is taxed at lower rates than rates applicable to income generated in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions in which we do business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our effective tax rate in the future, and accordingly our results of operations and financial position, could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax law or if more of our income becomes taxable in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) was enacted in the United States.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The changes included in the Act are broad and complex.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The final transition impacts of the Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our estimated impacts of the new law are based on our current knowledge and assumptions, and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results in future periods and our further analysis of the Act.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our largest stockholder is our Chairman and CEO, George F. Colony, who owns approximately 43% of our outstanding stock.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	This concentration of ownership enables Mr. Colony to strongly influence or effectively control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	This concentration of ownership may also limit the liquidity of our stock.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	As a result, efforts by stockholders to change the direction, management or ownership of Forrester may be unsuccessful, and stockholders may not be able to freely purchase and sell shares of our stock.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any Weakness Identified in Our System of Internal Controls by Us and Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that companies evaluate and report on their systems of internal control over financial reporting.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on its evaluation of those controls.
1023313_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	There can be no assurance that no weakness in our internal control over financial reporting will occur in future periods, or that any such weakness will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, including our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner.
1023313_18_ITEM1B_P0_S0	We have not received written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission that remain unresolved.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Our corporate headquarters building is comprised of approximately 190,000 square feet of office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, substantially all of which is currently occupied by the Company.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	This facility accommodates research, data, marketing, sales, consulting, technology, and operations personnel.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease term of this facility expires February 28, 2027.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also rent office space in San Francisco, New York City, Dallas, McLean, Virginia, Nashville, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Paris, New Delhi, and Singapore.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our San Francisco lease is for approximately 19,000 square feet, with a term that expires June 30, 2022.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our New York lease is for approximately 15,200 square feet, with an initial term until January 31, 2021.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S6	The London lease is for approximately 17,800 square feet, with a term that expires September 24, 2021.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S7	We also lease office space on a relatively short-term basis in various other locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
1023313_18_ITEM2_P0_S8	We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet future needs.
1023313_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol FORR .
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	During 2016, quarterly dividends of $0.18 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	During 2017, quarterly dividends of $0.19 per common share were declared and paid in each of the four quarters during the year.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	In February 2018, our Board of Directors declared an increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share that is payable on March 21, 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S4	We intend to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends; however, the actual declaration of any such future dividends, and the establishment of the per share amount and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S5	As of March 5, 2018 there were approximately 31 stockholders of record of our common stock.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S6	On March 5, 2018 the closing price of our common stock was $41.25 per share.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P0_S7	The following table represents the ranges of high and low sale prices of our common stock for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:
1023313_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	Through 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an aggregate $485.0 million to purchase common stock under our stock repurchase program including $25.0 million authorized in October 2016.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had repurchased approximately 16.1 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $464.9 million.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	In February 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $50.0 million to our stock repurchase program.
1023313_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following graph contains the cumulative stockholder return on our common stock during the period from December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2017 with the cumulative return during the same period for the Russell 2000 and the S P 600 Small Cap Information Technology Index, and assumes that the dividends, if any, were rein vested.
1023313_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected financial data presented below is derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read in connection with those statements.
1023313_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	Cash dividends in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 represent quarterly dividends of $0.19, $0.18, $0.17, $0.16 and $0.15 per common share declared and paid during 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1023313_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	The following items impact the comparability of our consolidated data:
1023313_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	The 2013 other income and gains (losses) on investments, net amount includes a $1.9 million loss for the sale of the Company s entire portfolio of auction rate securities.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview We derive revenues from memberships to, and sales of, our Research, Connect and Analytics (rebranded from Data) products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects, and hosting Events.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	We offer contracts for our Research, Connect and Analytics products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Membership revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	Clients purchase advisory services independently and/or to supplement their memberships to our subscription-based products.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Advisory service revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Consulting project revenues, which generally are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each Event.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense for all personnel that produce and deliver our products and services, including all associated editorial, travel, and support services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	Overhead costs such as facilities and annual fees for cloud-based information technology systems are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	Deferred revenue, agreement value, client retention, dollar retention, enrichment and number of clients are metrics that we believe are important to understanding our business.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe that the amount of deferred revenue, along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services, provide a significant measure of our business activity.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	We define these metrics as follows:
1023313_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all contracts in force at a given time (but not including advisory-only and Events contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	No single client accounted for more than 3% of agreement value at December 31, 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve-month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dollar retention the total dollar value of client membership contracts expiring during the most recent twelve-month period, which are renewed in whole or in part, as a percentage of the dollar value of all expiring client membership contracts during the same period.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve-month period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Clients we aggregate the various divisions and subsidiaries of a corporate parent as a single client and we also aggregate separate instrumentalities of the federal, state, and provincial governments as single clients.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Client retention, dollar retention, and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2017 increased 8% compared to the prior year and increased 6% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, due to growth in contract bookings exceeding revenue recognized for the year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Agreement value at December 31, 2017 increased 2% compared to the prior year and increased 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, representing an increase in the related contract bookings for the year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Deferred revenue at December 31, 2016 decreased 5% compared to the prior year and decreased 4% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, due to our revenue growth for the year exceeding contract bookings.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Agreement value at December 31, 2016 increased 1% compared to the prior year and increased 3% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, representing an increase in the related contract bookings for the year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Client retention and dollar retention rates declined from the fourth quarter of 2015 to lows in the first quarter of 2017 for client retention and the fourth quarter of 2016 for dollar retention.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	These retention rates have since improved or remained flat each sequential quarter since their lows, with client retention up 2 percentage points, and dollar retention up 1 percentage point, at December 31, 2017 from their respective low points.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P12_S6	Our enrichment metric was at a low of 93% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and has since improved or remained flat in each sequential quarter since its low, and has increased 3 percentage points from its low point.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1023313_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our policies and estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P13_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	We consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	If actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	This is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management s judgment in its application.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-8.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	We generate revenues from licensing memberships to, and sales of, our Research, Connect and Analytics products and services, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting Events.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	We execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products or services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	For example, when a discount off of list price is provided in a multiple element contract, the amount of revenue that is allocated to our Research, Connect and Analytics products that commence delivery on the first day of the contract is limited based on the contract price that would be refundable to the customer if the yet undelivered products were never delivered.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We obtain the relative selling prices of our products and services based upon an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year or upon an analysis of the estimated selling price of products for which there are insufficient standalone sales.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	The majority of our research services revenues, including our Research, Leadership Boards and Analytics subscription products, are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Certain research services revenues, including revenues from sales of reprints, are recognized as revenue when delivered.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the Event.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P20_S5	Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services and events revenues.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Annual subscriptions to Research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of li cense, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, and unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, all of which are delivered throughout the contract period and are accounted for as one unit of accounting.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Annual subscriptions for Leadership Boards inclu de access to the Research offering, access to a private forum with other Leadership Board member peers, access to a Forrester advisor, member-generated content, and one Event ticket.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	Leadership Boards are accounted for as two units of accounting: ( 1) the E vent ticket and ( 2) the remaining services that are delivered throughout the contract period.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon their relative selling prices, which are determined based on standalone sales of E vent tickets a nd the estimated selling price of the remaining services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Annual subscriptions to our Analytics subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data advisor, which are delivered throughout the contract period, and ar e accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the contract period.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Certain of our Analytics subscription products also include advisory services and these contracts are accounted for as two units of acco unting: ( 1) th e subscription and data advisor and ( 2) the advisory services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	Arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon its relative selling price, which is determined based on standalone sales of the advisory services and the estim ated selling price of the remaining Analytics services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	Our revenue recognition also determines the timing of commission expenses, as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P23_S4	We evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We hold minority interests in technology-related investment funds with a book value of $1.9 million at December 31, 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	These investment funds are not publicly traded, and, therefore, because no established market for these securities exists, the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	These investments are accounted for using the equity method, and as such we record our share of the investee s operating results each period.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	We review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment in the investment has occurred.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	We record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we had $76.9 million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	In order to determine if an impairment exists, we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, we have selected November 30th as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	The annual assessment of goodwill can be based on either a quantitative or qualitative assessment, or a combination of both.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of November 30, 2017 based on a qualitative assessment.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our qualitative assessment included Company specific (financial performance and long-range plans), industry, and macroeconomic factors, and the consideration of the fair value of each reporting unit, which significantly exceeded their respective carrying values, at the last valuation date of November 30, 2016.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Based on our qualitative assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values and no further impairment testing is required.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P27_S5	Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Intangible assets with finite lives as of December 31, 2017 consist of acquired customer relationships and were valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	These assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment, which are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	We continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long-lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	No such events or circumstances occurred during 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	To compute whether intangible assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards (from acquisitions).
1023313_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	We consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategie s in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Total revenues increased 4% during 201 7 compared to 201 6 and 3 % after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. increased 5 % during 201 7 compared to the prior year and remained at 5 % after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, representing 23% of total revenues in 201 7 and reflecting strong growth in the Asia Pacific region and low growth rates in Canada and Europe.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	We expect consolidated revenue growth to be in a range of growth at 4 % to 7 % in 201 8 , or growth of 3 % to 6 % after adjusting for the effect of estimated currency fluctuations.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	We expect the r evenue growth rate for research services to accelerate slightly in 201 8 compared to 201 7 due to higher c ontract bookings in 201 7 compared to the prior year, and we expect the revenue growth rate for advisory services and events to decrease slightly in 2018 compared to 2017 due in part to our delivery of an above-normal amount of advisory and consulting services in the fourth quarter of 2017 .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Research services revenues are recognized as revenue primarily on a ratable basis over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve-month periods.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Research services revenues increased 1% during 2017 compared to the prior year and foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant effect on revenue growth.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The increase reflects growth in our Connect and Research products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Analytics products.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	Revenues from advisory services and events increased 9% during 2017 compared to the prior year and foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant effect on revenue growth.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	The increase was due to 9% growth in our consulting and advisory products and our Events business.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	Please refer to the Segment Results section below for a discussion of revenue and contribution margin results by segment.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	Cost of services and fulfillment expenses increased 7% in 2017 compared to 2016 and foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant effect on the growth rate.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to (1) a $5.4 million increase in compensation and benefit costs, resulting from a 3% increase in the average number of employees, an increase in incentive bonus expense and annual merit increases compared to the prior year, (2) a $1.5 million increase in professional services costs due to an increase in outsourced fees related to consulting projects delivered, an increase in fees related to the delivery of reprints on our digital reprint platform, and an i ncrease in costs for the digitization of our Analytics products, and (3) a $0.8 million increase in Event expenses.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Selling and marketing expenses increased 6% in 2017 compared to 2016 and foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant effect on the growth rate.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from a 3% increase in the average number of employees, annual merit increases, an increase in incentive bonuses and an increase in severance costs compared to the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	We intend to increase our sales employees by approximately 1% to 3% during 2018 as compared to 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	General and administrative expenses increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016 and foreign currency fluctuations had an insignificant effect on the growth rate.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to (1) a $1.1 million increase in salaries and benefits resulting from a 4% increase in the average number of employees, annual merit increases, and an increase in incentive bonuses and (2) a $0.7 million increase in stock compensation expense primarily due to the expansion of our Board of Directors in 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional services primarily due to a decrease in legal and accounting expenses.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	Depreciation Depreciation expense decreased by $1.2 million to $6.6 million in 2017 as compared to $7.8 million in 2016 due to certain equipment and software assets becoming fully depreciated.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	We expect depreciation expense to increase to a range of $8.7 million to $9.2 million in 2018 due to capital expenditures in 2017 having a full year of depreciation expense in 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S5	Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization expense remained essentially consistent in 2017 as compared to 2016.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S6	Reorganization Costs During 2016, we incurred $1.0 million of severance and related benefits costs for a reduction in our workforce implemented and completed in the first quarter of 2016, of approximately 2% of employees across various geographies and functions.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S7	All costs under this plan were paid during 2016.

1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S9	The contraction in income from operations as a percentage of total revenues in 2017 was due operating expenses increasing by 5% compared to revenue growth of only 4%.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S10	The primary cause of the operating expense increase was a 6% increase in compensation and benefits during 2017 as compared to 2016.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S11	Although our year-end headcount increased by only 1% compared to 2016, our average headcount for the year increased by 3%.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S12	In addition to the headcount increase, we incurred an increase in incentive compensation during 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P39_S13	We expect income from operations as a percentage of total revenues to remain essentially flat in a range of 7.5% to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our marketable investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	The decrease in other income, net during 2017 was due to foreign currency losses of approximately $0.6 million during the current year compared to foreign currency gains of approximately $0.1 million during the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	This decrease was slightly offset by an increase in interest income of $0.3 million as compared to 2016.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Losses on Investments, Net Losses on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains or losses from our technology-related investment funds and gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease in investment losses during 2017 was due to a decrease in investment losses incurred by the underlying funds as compared to the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act ) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $1.6 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of federal deferred tax assets and liabilities was $1.2 million.

1023313_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	ov i s i on a l a m oun t s.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate during 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to $1.6 million of tax expense in 2017 due to the Act (as described above) which was partially offset by a $1.3 million tax benefit in 2017 from the settlement of a tax audit.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	We expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 to be approximately 31%, which includes legislative changes from the Act.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	Our future effective tax rate may fluctuate based upon numerous factors including the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units, which are affected by the value of our common stock at the time of exercise or vesting.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Total revenues increased 4% during 2016 compared to 2015 and 5% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.

1023313_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	The increase in dollars was primarily due to (1) a $1.2 million increase in compensation and benefit costs, resulting from an increase in the average number of employees and annual merit increases compared to the prior year and (2) a $2.3 million increase in professional services costs due to an increase in outsourced fees related to consulting projects delivered and an increase in fees related to the new digital reprint platform, which were partially offset by a decrease in survey costs.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	These increases were partially offset by a reduction in Event expenses of $0.9 million and a reduction in travel expenses of $0.7 million.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Selling and marketing expenses increased 1% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2% after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.

1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	During 2015, we incurred $3.2 million of severance and related costs from our reorganization in the first quarter of 2015 that included the termination of 50 employees or approximately 4% of our workforce across various geographies and functions, in order to reallocate investment in 2015 to planned sales expansion and to delivery areas seeing the greatest client demand.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	We incurred an additional $0.3 million charge in the second quarter of 2015 related to this action primarily for a non-cash charge for the liquidation of a small non-U.S. subsidiary.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	In addition, during the third quarter of 2015 we incurred $0.7 million of severance and related benefits for the reorganization of our Products Group, consisting of the termination of the chief product officer and related administrative staff, and the termination of a senior product leader with the intent to relocate this position to the U.S.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	As a result of the change in leadership in the Products Group, we incurred an additional $0.2 million of expense to write off a software development project that was no longer deemed probable to be completed.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	Income from Operations Income from operations increased $11.9 million or 63% during 2016 as compared to the prior year and increased to 9.4% of total revenues in 2016 from 6.0% in the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	The expansion in income from operations as a percentage of total revenues in 2016 was due to a small increase in headcount during the year, tight cost controls for travel and entertainment, and a $3.4 million decrease in reorganization costs in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P52_S6	The focus on cost controls during 2016 along with the decrease in reorganization costs resulted in our operating expenses increasing by less than 1% compared to 2015, while revenues increased 4% compared to 2015.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other Income, Net Other income, net primarily consists of interest income on our marketable investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in other income, net during 2016 was due to (1) an increase in interest income of $0.1 million as compared to 2015 and (2) foreign currency gains of approximately $0.1 million during the current year versus insignificant foreign currency losses during the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	Losses on Investments, Net Losses on investments, net include our share of equity method investment gains or losses from our technology-related investment funds and gains or losses from the sale of marketable securities.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The increase in investment losses during 2016 was due to an increase in investment losses incurred by the underlying funds as compared to the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The increase in the effective tax rate during 2016 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to (1) $1.0 million of tax expense in 2016 due to a valuation allowance on capital losses generated from one of our non-marketable investments and (2) a one-time $0.6 million benefit in 2015, which did not recur in 2016, from a change in tax legislation related to the U.S. Tax Court opinion in the Altera case as described below.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The effect of these items was partially offset by the inclusion in 2015 of a $0.3 million loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary in 2015 for which a tax benefit could not be recognized and lower non-deductible stock compensation expense in 2016 compared to 2015.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	In July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The opinion invalidates part of a treasury regulation requiring stock-based compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	the years of 2012 through 2014, was appropriate based on the opinion in the case.

1023313_18_ITEM7_P61_S5	In the first quarter of 2017, we modified our internal reporting for the Research and Project Consulting segments to reflect the transfer of revenue and direct costs related to a small consulting team in Asia Pacific from Research to Project Consulting, and to remove from both Research and Project Consulting certain client support activities that are now included within selling, marketing, administrative and other expenses.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P61_S6	Accordingly, the 2016 and 2015 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	Research services revenues increased 2% during 2016 compared to the prior year, reflecting growth in our Research products partially offset by a decline in revenue in our Connect and Analytics products.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	Advisory services and events revenues increased $2.9 million, or 16%, during 2016 compared to the prior year due to a $2.4 million increase in Analytics consulting and a $0.5 million increase in Events revenues.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	Product segment expenses increased 8% during 2016 compared to the prior year period due entirely to a $3.0 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due to an increase in employees for the Analytics, Events and Connect products.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S4	Event costs decreased by $0.9 million in 2016, which were mostly offset by small increases in professional services expenses and multiple other expense items.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S5	Research segment revenues increased 1% during 2017 compared to the prior year due to an increase in advisory revenue that was partially offset by a decrease in consulting revenues.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S6	Approximately 80% of the revenue is this segment is generated from advisory services.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S7	The decrease in consulting revenues is due to the consultants in the Project Consulting segment delivering a greater portion of our consulting revenue.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S8	Research segment expenses increased by 3% compared to the prior year due primarily to a $1.5 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due an increase in headcount, annual merit increases, and an increase in incentive bonuses.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S9	Research segment revenues increased 5% during 2016 compared to the prior year due to an increase in both advisory and consulting revenues.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S10	Research segment expenses decreased by 2% compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in travel expenses while compensation and benefit costs were flat.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S11	Project Consulting segment revenues increased 18% during 2017 compared to the prior year as our content marketing group delivered strong revenue growth while our strategy consulting group experienced more moderate growth.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S12	Project Consulting segment expenses increased $2.3 million, or 10%, during 2017 compared to the prior year due primarily to a $1.4 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due to an increase in headcount, annual merit increases, and an increase in incentive bonuses during 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S13	There was also a $0.8 million increase in travel and entertainment and outsource fees due to the increased delivery of consulting engagements during the year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S14	Project Consulting segment revenues increased 5% during 2016 compared to the prior year as our content marketing group delivered strong revenue growth while our strategy consulting group experienced a decline in revenues.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P63_S15	Project Consulting segment expenses remained consistent during 2016 compared to the prior year.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Research services revenues, which constituted approximately 64% of our revenues during 2017, are generally renewable annually and are typically payable in advance.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	We generated cash from operating activities of $37.5 million and $44.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	The $7.0 million decrease in cash provided from operations during 2017 is primarily attributable to (1) a $4.6 million decrease in cash generated from the change in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which represents revenues exceeding cash collections during 2017 in contrast to an excess of cash collected compared to revenues during 2016 and (2) a $3.3 million decrease in cash from working capital.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	During 201 7 , we used $1. 0 million of cash for investing activities, consisting primarily of $ 7 .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	9 million of purchases of property and equipment , which was partially offset by $ 6.5 million in net maturities of marketable investments .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Property and equipment purchases during 201 7 consisted primarily of software and leasehold improvements for our new Nashville office .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $ 5 .0 million to $7.0 million during 201 8 .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P66_S2	During 201 6 , we used $17.9 million of cash for investing activities, consisting primarily of $13.7 million in net purchases of marketable investments and $4.1 million of purchases of property and equipment.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P66_S3	Property and equipment purchases during 2016 consisted primarily of software .
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	We regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations of investment grade.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	We used $37.6 million of cash from financing activities during 2017 primarily due to $40.0 million for purchases of our common stock and $13.6 million for the payment of quarterly dividends, consisting of a $0.19 per share dividend each quarter, as well as $2.5 million in taxes paid related to net share settlements of restricted stock units.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	These uses were partially offset by $18.5 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	We used $0.1 million of cash from financing activities during 2016 primarily due to the payment of $13.0 million in quarterly dividends, consisting of a $0.18 per share dividend each quarter, $1.8 million for purchases of our common stock, and $2.1 million in taxes paid related to net share settlements of restricted stock units.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	These uses were partially offset by $16.7 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S5	As of December 31, 2017, our remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $20.1 million.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S6	In February 2018, our Board of Directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by an additional $50.0 million, bringing the total remaining authorization to $70.1 million at the time of the increase.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S7	We plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during 2018, as market conditions warrant.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S8	As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $79.8 million and marketable investments of $54.3 million.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S9	These balances include $60.5 million held outside of the U.S.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S10	If these funds outside of the U.S. are needed for operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and may be required to pay withholding taxes to foreign jurisdictions to repatriate these funds.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S11	We would not expect these additional taxes to be significant.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S12	However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S13	We do not currently have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future except in the case of a significant acquisition.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S14	We believe that our current cash balance, marketable investments, and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P67_S15	As of December 31, 2017, we had future contractual obligations as follows:
1023313_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	(1) Operating leases comprise of future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable property leases.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	(2) Purchase commitments principally comprise of contractual commitments for software, outsourced research services and Event venues.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	As of December 31, 2017, $0.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest, net of the federal benefit, was included in non-current liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	These amounts were not included in the table above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when a cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolutions of those examinations is uncertain.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P70_S2	We do not maintain any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1023313_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	We have historically not used derivative financial instruments.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities during the course of the year, which may include U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The securities, other than money market funds, are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	If interest rates rise, the market value of our investments may decline, which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	We have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity (without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers).
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	In addition, given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table provides information about our investment portfolio, for which all of the securities are denominated in U.S. dollars.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	For investment securities, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by maturity date.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Principal amounts by maturity dates (dollars in thousands):
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	On a global level, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In addition, transactions and account balances between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of $0.6 million.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred foreign currency exchange gains of $0.1 million and for the year ended December 31, 2015 foreign currency exchange losses were insignificant.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Historically, we have not entered into any hedging agreements as we have assessed our exposure to sudden changes in foreign currency exchange rates to be insignificant.
1023313_18_ITEM7A_P8_S3	However, we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro, British pound or other foreign currencies.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	The financial statements listed in the following Index to Financial Statements are filed as a part of this 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.:
1023313_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1023313_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1023313_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P4_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	We conducted our audits i n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P6_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P6_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P6_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2010.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc. ( Forrester or the Company ) is a global independent research, data, and advisory services firm.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Forrester works with business and technology leaders to help them develop customer-obsessed strategies that drive growth.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Forrester s unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 675,000 consumers and business leaders worldwide, rigorous and objective research methodologies, and the shared wisdom of our clients.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	Through proprietary research and data, custom consulting, exclusive executive peer groups and events, Forrester challenges the thinking of its clients and positions them to lead change in their organizations.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	Forrester considers the more significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P18_S3	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as either Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Level 1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Level 2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P20_S2	Level 3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company s portfolio of investments may at any time include securities of U.S. government agencies, municipal notes and bonds, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	Forrester accounts for all marketable investments as available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses (not related to credit losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P22_S3	Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P22_S4	The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment losses on its available-for-sale securities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no off-balance sheet or significant concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or 3% of accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P27_S1	Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November 30th as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	Impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Non-Current Liabilities The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as non-current liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	The non-current deferred rent liability at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $7.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively, and results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Company s facility leases.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	The functional currency of the majority of Forrester s wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currency.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forrester s common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the award s expected term.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	The expected term calcula tion is based upon Forrester s historical experience of exercise patterns.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of December 31, 2017 was $ 16 .
1023313_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	6 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 2 .
1023313_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make contractually obligated payments.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment terms.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	If the financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Company s customers were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	Forrester s provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P53_S4	The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The guidance eliminates the exception under existing standards that permits the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers to be deferred until the transferred asset i s sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	The guidance applies to all intra-entity sales of assets other than inventory.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	As a result, a reporting entity would recognize the tax expense from the sale of the asset in the seller s tax jurisd iction when the transfer occurs and any deferred tax asset that arises in the buyer s jurisdiction would also be recognized at the time of the transfer.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P54_S4	As a result, the Company has recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained ea rnings as of January 1, 2017 .

1023313_18_ITEM8_P58_S6	In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements: Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which clarifies several topics including, certain types of transactions that are outside the scope of the new standard, disclosure requirements, and balance sheet considerations.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Company will adopt the standard as of January 1, 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective method.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company does not anticipate that the standard will have a material impact on its results of operations.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	The number of performance obligations in the Company s arrangements will not be different under the new standard.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	Determining standalone selling prices and allocating contract consideration on multiple element arrangements will not be different from the Company s current methodologies of establishing fair value and estimated selling price for our goods and services or allocating total contract consideration under the relative selling price method.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Subscription based research services revenues will continue to be recognized over time, using the new standard s output method of time elapsed, as Forrester s clients receive and consume the benefits of its services as the Company transfer s control throughout the contract period.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Advisory, reprint and E vents revenues will continue to be recognized at the point in time as control is transferred to the customer, which will generally be when the client has physical possession of the good(s) or upon completion of the service(s).
1023313_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	T he Company expects that mo st of its consulting contracts will continue to be recognized over time, while some contracts may be required to be recognized at a point in time upon completion of the project.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The following changes are anticipated under the new standard:
1023313_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company will no longer record accounts receivable and deferred revenue on its balance sheet when it issues an invoice to a customer for a contract that is cancellable by the customer.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	For contracts that are cancellable, the Company will only record accounts receivable up to the amount of revenue earned but not yet collected.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	This change will have the effect of reducing the amount of accounts receivable and deferred revenue on the balance sheet compared to amounts recorded based on current accounting standards.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	The majority of the Company s contracts are non-cancellable; however, the Company has not yet determined the effect of this change on its balance sheet.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The timing of revenue recognition for prepaid performance obligations that are expected to expire unused, which may include E vent tickets, reprints and advisory hours, will change from recognition at the time of expiration under the current standard to recognition in proportion to the pattern of related rights exercised by the customer.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company currently expects this change to primarily affect the timing of revenue within the quarters of 2018 but does not expect it to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations for the full year of 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Costs to fulfill contracts, such as our survey costs for our Analtyics product line, are currently deferred and recognized over the aggregate period of the contracts under the current standards.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	These costs will be recognized as incurred under the new standard, which the Company expects will have an immaterial effect on the results of operations for the full year of 2018, however it will change the timing of the recognition of the costs on a quarterly basis as compared to the current standards.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Key areas still in process include the calculation of the cumulative effect adjustment for the adoption of the standard, which will be recorded as of January 1, 2018, and development of reports for the various disclosures required in 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	These areas will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases .

1023313_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	The new standard simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and requires that instead, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	The new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P70_S3	The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act ) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	Changes include, but are not limited to, a decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Company has calculated its best estimate of the impact of the Act in its 2017 income tax provision in accordance with the Company s understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $1.6 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of federal deferred tax assets and liabilities was $1.2 million.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P85_S4	The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $0.4 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $22.6 million.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	In July 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	The opinion invalidates part of a treasury regulation requiring stock-based compensation to be included in any qualified intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	The Company has reviewed this case and concluded that recording a tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2015, representing the benefit of adjusting its cost-sharing agreement for the years of 2012 through 2014, was appropriate based on the opinion in the case.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P89_S3	This benefit is included in the change in tax legislation line in the table above.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P89_S4	There were no significant developments in this case during 2017 and the Company will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to its consolidated financial statements.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P92_S3	Although realization is not assured, based upon the Company s historical taxable income and projections of the Company s future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P92_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively, primarily relating to U.S. capital losses from the Company s investment in technology-related private equity funds, and from foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P92_S8	As of December 31, 2017, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $6.6 million, of which $0.4 million expires in 2018, $1.6 million expires in 2020, $1.4 million expires in 2021, and $3.2 million expires in 2022.

1023313_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $0.8 million, all of which if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate in a future period.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	It is reasonably possible that $0.4 million of this amount may be settled within the next 12 months as the Company expects to reach a settlement with U.S. Competent Authority on the treatment of a prior year foreign tax payment.
1023313_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and such amounts were not significant in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

1023313_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
1023313_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
