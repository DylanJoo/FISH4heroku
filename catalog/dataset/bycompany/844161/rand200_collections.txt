844161_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
844161_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	During our most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Cherokee Inc. (which may be referred to as we, us, our or the Company) is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Sideout and Carole Little brands and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are one of the leading licensors of brand names and trademarks for apparel, footwear, home and accessories in the world.
844161_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Cherokee was incorporated in Delaware in 1988.
844161_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our principal executive offices are located at 6835 Valjean Avenue, Van Nuys, California 91406, telephone (818) 908-9868.
844161_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	We maintain a website with the address www.thecherokeegroup.com.
844161_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
844161_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	We own several trademarks, including Cherokee , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others.
844161_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	As of January 29, 2011, we had thirty continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets.
844161_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners, companies, wholesalers and retailers in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores.
844161_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns us with our retailer licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	We do not believe that the extra week in the occasionally reported 53-week fiscal year results in any material impact on our financial results.
844161_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods which may differ from ours.
844161_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year-to-year basis.
844161_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	As used herein the term "First Quarter" refers to the three months ended May 1, 2010; the term "Second Quarter" refers to the three months ended July 31, 2010; the term "Third Quarter" refers to the three months ended October 30, 2010; and the term "Fourth Quarter" refers to the three months ended January 29, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Cherokee brand, which began as a footwear brand in 1973, is an iconic American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual comfort at affordable prices.
844161_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	We acquired the Sideout brand, which offers an authentic, casual street and beach inspired "California Lifestyle", and related trademarks, in November 1997.
844161_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz and Chorus Line brands and trademarks were acquired by us in December 2002, and are recognized women's brands.
844161_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our primary emphasis is domestic and international retail direct licensing.
844161_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	As of January 29, 2011, we had thirty continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets, thirteen of which pertain to the Cherokee brand.
844161_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	By entering into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations and providing them the authority to manufacture and sell products with our brands coupled with our creative marketing services, management believes stockholder value will be maximized.
844161_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our license agreements are with retailers, wholesalers and global trading companies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.
844161_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	Of our thirty licensing agreements, sixteen are retail direct contracts with domestic or international retailers, eleven are with a domestic or international wholesaler, and three are brand representations with third parties who have partnered, or are seeking to partner with domestic or international retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	In retail direct licensing, we grant retailers a license to use the trademarks on certain product categories of merchandise.
844161_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	We collaborate with our licensees' product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or amplify the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	In nearly all cases, all products are subject to our pre-approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards, and all marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	The retailer is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise.
844161_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We refer to this practice as our "retail direct" licensing strategy.
844161_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Wholesale licensees manufacture and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We plan to continue to solicit new licensees through our executive employees as well as using outside consultants.
844161_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our retail direct licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that in the United States and other advanced or developed retail markets worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, footwear and accessories business, from product development and design, to merchandising, sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by large retailers, who not only command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with the end consumer.
844161_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We believe that these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by directly designing, sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than through carrying strictly private label goods or branded products from third-party vendors.
844161_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	We also expect that the enhanced profitability of our direct licensing strategy, coupled with the substantial marketing costs to establish and maintain an in-store brand, will continue to increase the desirability to retailers of our strategy.
844161_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our primary strategy is to capitalize on these trends around the world by licensing our portfolio of brand names directly to retailers, who, working in conjunction with us, develop merchandise for their stores, and to augment that portfolio by acquiring additional brands which have high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a range of merchandise categories.
844161_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Generally, royalty rates on retail direct licenses vary as a percentage of the retailer's net sales of licensed products and may decrease depending on the retailer's annual sales of licensed products and the retailer's guaranteed annual sales of licensed products.
844161_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	As an incentive for our licensees to achieve higher retail sales of Cherokee, Sideout, Carole Little or other branded products, some of our royalty agreements are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain specified cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees during each fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	As a result, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees' retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease throughout each fiscal year as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements.
844161_11_ITEM1_P16_S4	Therefore, the amount of royalty revenue received by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales of branded products in such quarter, but also on the cumulative level of retail sales, and the resulting attainment of royalty rate reductions in any preceding quarters in the same fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM1_P16_S5	The size of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement.
844161_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe that our core strengths enable us to be well positioned to expand our business and enhance stockholder value through execution of our strategy.
844161_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our global strategic initiatives currently include:
844161_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Creative Services Providing regular, on-going creative inspiration and direction for product design in key categories.
844161_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our vision and infrastructure are transforming so that we can offer more feedback to retailers through monthly and quarterly reports and market research, the identification and sharing of global approved sourcing and manufacturing partners, and retail analytics in order to support our licensees.
844161_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Marketing Services Evolve the brands' positioning, on a gloabal scale, to maintain freshness and relevance for today's family and strengthening the brands' marketing platforms in collaboration with our retail partners on direct-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer basis through updated floor presentations, and social and digital media initiatives.
844161_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	In addition, the Company plans to reflect its global brand vision by launching various on-line initiatives; invest in social media and use it as a means to get and stay closer to our customer; create a mobile phone strategy to increase engagement, interaction and promotion; investment in paid search, search engine optimization and Web analytics; and develop an on-going email campaign that builds awareness, rewards loyalty, and drives traffic.
844161_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Management has undertaken a more proactive approach towards acquisitions in order to diversify our portfolio of consumer brands while simultaneously growing our namesake Cherokee brand and leveraging our expertise with our current global platform.
844161_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Accordingly, we intend to seek ways to expand the scope of our existing brands through new and diversified distribution channels, domestically and internationally; new and creative retail presence; additional consumer product categories; and cutting-edge marketing techniques that will increase brand recognition.
844161_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	At January 29, 2011, we had thirteen ongoing licensing agreements for our Cherokee brand.
844161_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	These all represent retail direct licensing agreements.
844161_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Licensing revenues from our Cherokee brand totaled $27.1 million for our fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011"), which represented 88.1% of our total revenues.
844161_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	One of our most significant retail direct licensing agreements is with Target Corporation ("Target") for the Cherokee brand in the United States.
844161_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	The current terms of our relationship with Target are set forth in a restated license agreement with Target, which was entered into effective as of February 1, 2008 (the "Restated Target Agreement").
844161_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	The Restated Target Agreement grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in various specified categories of merchandise.
844161_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	During the term of the Restated Target Agreement, in most cases, we must receive Target's consent to enter into additional licensing agreements in the United States with respect to the Cherokee brand.
844161_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Therefore, our current focus with respect to the Cherokee brand is to continue to develop that brand at Target and to develop the Cherokee brand in international markets through retail direct or wholesale licenses with manufacturers or other companies that have market power and economies of scale in those respective markets.
844161_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The term of the Restated Target Agreement continues through January 31, 2013.
844161_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	The Restated Target Agreement provides that if Target remains current in its payments of the minimum guaranteed royalty of $9.0 million for the preceding fiscal year, then the agreement will continue to automatically renew for successive fiscal year terms provided that Target does not give notice of its intention to terminate the agreement during February of the calendar year prior to termination.
844161_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Under the Restated Target Agreement, Target has agreed to pay royalties based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year ended January 31 st , which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise.
844161_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Royalty revenues from Target were $13.0 million during Fiscal 2011, $13.2 million during our fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010"), and $15.2 million during our fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 ("Fiscal 2009") which accounted for 42.1%, 40.6%, and 42%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The termination of the Restated Target Agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business (See Item 1A, "Risk Factors").
844161_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	As of January 29, 2011, we had twelve international license agreements for the Cherokee brand (Tesco, Zellers, Comercial Mexicana, Pick 'N Pay, Falabella, Shufersal LTD., Grupo Pao de Acucar, Arvind Mills, Eroski, RT-Mart, Nishimatsuya and Magnit).
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	In August 2001, we entered into a retail direct licensing agreement for the Cherokee brand with Great Britain's Tesco Stores Limited ("Tesco").
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Tesco was granted the exclusive right to manufacture, promote, sell and distribute a wide range of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United Kingdom and Ireland and is obligated to pay us a royalty based upon a percentage of its net sales of Cherokee branded products in those countries.
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	In January 2004, we granted Tesco the rights to certain other countries including South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Slovakia, and Hungary, and in 2005, we added the rights to Poland and the Czech Republic.
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	In March 2006, Tesco began to sell Cherokee branded products in the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia, and, in July 2006, Tesco began to sell Cherokee branded products in Hungary.
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	In February 2007, we added the territory of China to the Tesco agreement and Turkey was added shortly thereafter.
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S5	During Fiscal 2010, Tesco's rights to expand its license to include all Asian territories, including Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, and China lapsed.
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S6	The term of the Tesco agreement was recently renewed and now expires on January 31, 2014, and Tesco has several options to extend this term.
844161_11_ITEM1_P29_S7	Royalty revenues from Tesco totaled $8.3 million in Fiscal 2011, $12.0 million in Fiscal 2010, and $15.2 million in Fiscal 2009, which accounted for 27.1%, 36.9%, and 42% respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The termination of our license agreement with Tesco would have a material adverse effect on our business (See Item 1A, "Risk Factors").
844161_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	In August 1997, we entered into a retail direct license agreement with Zellers Inc. ("Zellers"), a Canadian retailer that is a division of Hudson's Bay Company.
844161_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Zellers was granted the exclusive right in Canada to use the Cherokee brand and related trademarks in connection with a broad range of categories of merchandise.
844161_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	In Fiscal 2007, Zellers renewed their agreement for an additional five year period, beginning February 1, 2007 and continuing through January 31, 2012.
844161_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	Under the terms of the renewed agreement, Zellers agreed to pay us a minimum guaranteed royalty of CDN $1.5 million per year (equivalent to approximately USD $1.5 million at January 29, 2011) over the new five-year term.
844161_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	In January 2011, Target entered into an agreement with Zellers to acquire leasehold interests in approximately 220 stores for $1.83 billion, allowing Target to open its first stores in Canada beginning in 2013.
844161_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Target expects to open 150 stores throughout Canada in 2013.
844161_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	Discussions regarding the transition of our agreement with Zellers to Target are in process.
844161_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	Unless and until a new agreement is reached, sales in Canada during Fiscal 2012 will be governed by the contract already in place with Zellers.
844161_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	Royalty revenues from Zellers totaled $2.0 million in Fiscal 2011, $1.4 million in Fiscal 2010, and $1.5 million in Fiscal 2009.

844161_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	The initial term of our agreement with Comercial Mexicana was recently extended for an additional year, and now expires on December 31, 2013.
844161_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	Comercial Mexicana also has the option to renew this agreement for additional terms.
844161_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	Subsequently, we have amended the agreement to extend an additional year.

844161_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	In return for our services, we normally receive a certain percentage of the net royalties generated by the brands we represent and sign to a license agreement.

844161_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66, developed by retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	Competitors with respect to the Sideout brand include Quiksilver, Nike and other active wear companies.
844161_11_ITEM1_P54_S3	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of directly sourced merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	Therefore, our success is dependent on our licensees' ability to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	Companies such as Iconix Brand Group, Phillips-Van Heusen, Perry Ellis International, VF Corp. and other companies owning established trademarks have and could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	As of January 29, 2011, we employed twenty-one persons.
844161_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
844161_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees of the Company.

844161_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees' net sales of licensed products.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66, developed by retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Competitors with respect to the Sideout brand include Quiksilver, Nike and other active wear companies.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands, and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of ours.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There are numerous risk factors that apply to the businesses of retailers that can affect their level of sales of products that carry our brands.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Any decline in sales by our licensees can adversely affect our revenues.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	that impact supply chains and transport vendors; the impact of excess retail capacity; changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; material acquisitions or dispositions; investments in new business strategies; the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; and natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers, including our existing retail partners, competing for limited floor pad and rack space.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is largely dependent on royalties from two licensees, Target and Tesco, which accounted for 42.1% and 27.1%, respectively, of our consolidated licensing revenues in Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	During Fiscal 2011, 42.1% of our licensing revenues were generated from Target and 27.1% of our licensing revenues were generated from Tesco.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow under the Restated Target Agreement if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products while continuing to pay the minimum royalties of $9.0 million per fiscal year required under such agreement.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are unsure whether we would be able to replace the royalty payments received from Target and Tesco.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The termination of either of these license agreements would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Together, these two licensees accounted for approximately 69.2% of our consolidated licensing revenues in Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions and the current global financial crisis.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may effect our licensees' sales.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Consumer spending is showing signs of stabilization; however it is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We hold various trademarks including Cherokee, Sideout, Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other countries.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our newly purchased enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that will be fully implemented by the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel and we recently appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Mark DiSiena, our Chief Financial Officer.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, on August 26, 2010, we experienced a transition in our executive management team, in connection with the appointment of Henry Stupp as our Chief Executive Officer and the appointment of our former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Margolis, as our Executive Chairman, who resigned from Cherokee on January 28, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Further, on November 5, 2010 we announced that our former Chief Financial Officer, Russell J. Riopelle, would be leaving Cherokee in mid December 2010.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	On November 11, 2010, we announced that we hired Mark DiSiena, who replaced Mr. Riopelle as our Chief Financial Officer following Mr. Riopelle's departure from Cherokee on December 17, 2010.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, resigned from Cherokee on January 28, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Neither Mr. Stupp nor Mr. DiSiena has worked with our existing executive management team prior to their joining us last year.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We cannot assure you that either of these management transitions will not result in some disruption of our business.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P23_S10	If either our new Chief Executive Officer or our new Chief Financial Officer is unable to work with our existing management team to implement our strategies, manage our operations and accomplish our objectives, our business, operations and financial results could be impaired.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We recently consummated a debt financing of $10,000,000 in principal in order to enable us to meet our payment obligations to our former Executive Chairman.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In connection with the resignation of our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, on January 28, 2011, we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release of all Claims (the "Separation Agreement"), with Mr. Margolis.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, (i) on February 17, 2011, we paid Mr. Margolis a one-time lump sum payment equal to $2,260,000 and (ii) on April 1, 2011, we paid Mr. Margolis his final annual performance bonus for Fiscal 2011 of $1.8 million.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, on February 7, 2011, we repurchased 400,000 shares (the "Repurchase Shares") of our Common Stock for aggregate proceeds of $7,260,000.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As payment for the Repurchase Shares, we issued promissory notes to affiliates of Mr. Margolis in the principal amount of $7,260,000 (collectively, the "Margolis Notes").
844161_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The Margolis Notes bore interest at an annual rate of 3% and were repaid by us in full on February 17, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In order to repay the Margolis Notes and meet our other obligations to Mr. Margolis under the Separation Agreement, on February 16, 2011, we entered into a term loan agreement with U.S. Bank (the "Bank") pursuant to which we borrowed $10,000,000 in principal (the "Loan Facility") and which bears interest at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, a selected by Cherokee pursuant to the terms of the Loan Facility.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The Loan Facility is to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $277,778 over the next three years following the date of the loan.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The Loan Facility is secured by all of Cherokee's assets and guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Although we have paid dividends during each quarter since December 2003, and including during the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate excess cash to pay dividends, or that we will continue to pay dividends with such excess cash if other, more compelling business opportunities are available, as determined by our Board of Directors.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our ability to generate excess cash from our operations in the future is dependent upon a variety of factors, including Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In Fiscal 2011, we paid a total of $13.5 million in dividends, which was materially greater than our net income of $7.7 million for Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In recognition of the fact that our payment of dividends could not continue at historical levels beyond Fiscal 2011 unless cash flow from operations increases substantially, on January 31, 2011, we announced that we further reduced our future quarterly dividend payments from $0.38 per share to $0.20 per share, which more closely aligned our dividend payments with our expected cash flow from operations while allowing us to retain a portion of our cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations and to invest in our business.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Should our future dividend payments exceed our cash from operations, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock.
844161_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease a 14,700 square foot office facility in Van Nuys, California.
844161_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our current lease term ends on July 31, 2013, and we have one three-year option to extend the lease, for which we would have to give notice by January 31, 2013.
844161_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our monthly rent is currently $12,500.
844161_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of business, from time to time we become involved in legal claims and litigation.
844161_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, based on consultations with legal counsel, the disposition of litigation currently pending against us is unlikely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
844161_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol "CHKE".
844161_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth for each of the fiscal quarters during our last two fiscal years the range of the high and low sale prices for our common stock and the cash dividends paid per share, if any.
844161_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	On April 7, 2011, the latest sale price for our common stock, reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market System, was $17.93 per share.

844161_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	On January 28, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $0.20 per common share dividend, which was paid on March 15, 2011 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by Cherokee's Board of Directors.
844161_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	On July 22, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our then outstanding common stock.
844161_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	Pursuant to this directive, and including certain repurchases of our common stock that were effected during Fiscal 2009 and are described below, we have used cash of $7.5 million to repurchase and retire a total of 717,516 shares of our common stock since the stock repurchases were authorized (excluding our one-time repurchase of 400,000 shares of our common stock held by affiliates of our former Executive Chairman, discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K).
844161_11_ITEM5_P5_S2	Our Board of Directors subsequently authorized and approved the extension of the expiration date of our stock repurchase program to January 31, 2012 and increased the number of remaining shares which could currently be repurchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions to a total of 800,000 shares of our common stock.
844161_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	During the second quarter of Fiscal 2009, we repurchased and retired 10,155 shares of our common stock at an average price of $21.59.
844161_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	During the third quarter of Fiscal 2009, we repurchased and retired 99,561 shares of our common stock at an average price of $17.62.
844161_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM5_P6_S3	During Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2011, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
844161_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	Continued repurchases of our stock, if any, will be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions.
844161_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	(1) On January 28, 2011, we entered into a separation agreement with our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, pursuant to which we irrevocably committed to repurchase 400,000 shares of our common stock from Mr. Margolis or his affiliates at a price of $18.15 per share, or $7.26 million in total.
844161_11_ITEM5_P8_S1	The repurchase was consummated on February 7, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly-traded licensing companies exists; hence, we compared the return on investment in our stock to the S P 100-LTD and NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX.
844161_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing January 28, 2006 and ending on January 29, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM5_P10_S1	The data set forth below assumes the value of an investment in our common stock and each Index was $100 on January 28, 2006.
844161_11_ITEM5_P10_S2	The data set forth below also assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.
844161_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected consolidated financial information has been taken or derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.
844161_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of our results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. See "Item 8.
844161_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, other filings we may make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as press releases and other written or oral statements we may make may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
844161_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	When used, the words "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "objectives", "goals", "aims", "hopes", "may", "likely", "should" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K include, among others, statements regarding our goals or expectations regarding our future revenues and earnings, the likelihood of increased retail sales by our current and future licensees, such as Target and Tesco, the likelihood that our licensees will achieve royalty rate reductions, our prospects for obtaining new licensees and our prospects for obtaining new brands to acquire or represent.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, achievements or share price to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or share price expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of the apparel industry and the retail industry, the overall level of consumer spending and our exposure to general economic conditions, the effect of intense competition we face from other apparel lines both within and outside of Target and Tesco, adverse changes in licensee or consumer acceptance of products bearing the Cherokee brand or our other brands as a result of fashion trends or otherwise, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the ability and/or commitment of our licensees to design, manufacture and market Cherokee or our other branded products, our dependence on two licensees for a substantial portion of our revenues, our dependence on our key management personnel and our recent appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer and our new Chief Financial Officer, any adverse determination of claims, liabilities or litigation, the requirements under our term loan with U.S. Bank, our ability to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are superior to those of our common stock, our payment or non-payment of dividends in future periods and the volatility in the trading price of our common stock.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Several of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail under "Item 1A. Business Risk Factors" as well as in the discussion and analysis below.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	You should however, understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties and you should not consider the risks and uncertainties identified by us to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties that could materially effect us.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements we make herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events and developments.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	Certain of the information set forth herein are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	Cherokee believes this information is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance of the Company's business and the Company's cash flow, excluding non-cash items that would normally be included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_11_ITEM7_P1_S8	Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
844161_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
844161_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Since May 1995, we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent.
844161_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	emphasizes domestic and international retail direct and wholesale licensing, whereby we grant wholesalers and retailers the license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Target currently has approximately 1,750 stores in the United States.
844161_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target decreased in the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011") by 3.81% to $816.8 million from the $850.5 million reported in the fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010").
844161_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	The decrease in retail sales is attributable to a decrease in retail prices.
844161_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Cherokee continues to be allotted more floor space in the children's category than any other brand at Target.
844161_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products, pursuant to our restated license agreement with Target (the "Restated Target Agreement").
844161_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Restated Target Agreement is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products during each fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	In Fiscal 2011, Target reached the guaranteed minimum yearly royalty amount of $9.0 million in the three month period ended January 29, 2011 (the "Fourth Quarter").
844161_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Based upon our new strategic initiatives, we believe that our future revenues from Target may be similar to or increase as compared to those reported in Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	Because we do not have direct oversight over Target, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given future period.
844161_11_ITEM7_P6_S5	However, we are providing new suggested guidance to Target in the marketing and sales of Cherokee branded products.
844161_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved, in terms of future royalty revenues that we expect to receive from Target, we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $13.0 million in Fiscal 2011, $13.2 million in Fiscal 2010, and $15.2 million in fiscal year ended January 31, 2009 ("Fiscal 2009"), which accounted for 42%, 40.6%, and 42.1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2011 were $17.8 million, during Fiscal 2010 were $19.3 million, and during Fiscal 2009 were $21.0 million, which accounted for 58%, 59.4% and 57.9%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the Fourth Quarter totaled $271.5 million compared to $264.0 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and $291.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $3.3 million for the Fourth Quarter, $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Overall, Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during Fiscal 2011 were lower than Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 and as a consequence, our royalty revenues from Target for Fiscal 2011 were lower than the royalty revenues reported in Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2011 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $75.7 million in the Fourth Quarter, as compared to $146.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and $167.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	For Fiscal 2011, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $404.0 million as compared to $633.0 million in Fiscal 2010 and $810.3 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We believe the decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products is due to Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the childrens product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories.
844161_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	We currently anticipate Tesco will reintroduce certain men's and women's product categories during the second or third quarter of our fiscal year ending January 29, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012").
844161_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $1.38 million for the Fourth Quarter, $2.45 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Based upon the recent decline of our revenues received from Tesco for retail sales in the U.K. and other territories, and the unsettled economic climate in Europe, it is likely that our revenues in Fiscal 2012 from Tesco will decline or remain flat from those of Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	In addition to the UK, Tesco continues to sell Cherokee branded products in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey and Ireland.
844161_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were approximately $29.6 million during the Fourth Quarter compared to $22.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and $19.7 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	For Fiscal 2011, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $98.7 million as compared to $72.4 million in Fiscal 2010 and $75.6 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	The increase in Zellers retail sales of the Cherokee branded products is attributed to the increase in childrens product categories as well as Zellers continued marketing and promotion of the Cherokee brand.
844161_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	During the Fourth Quarter, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $416.7 million versus $462.4 million and $500.5 million in total retail sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively.
844161_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	For Fiscal 2011, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled over $1.4 billion, which was below the $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively.
844161_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	TJX's sales of merchandise bearing the Carole Little and St. Tropez-West brands were approximately $9.9 million during the Fourth Quarter compared to $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010 and $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	For Fiscal 2011, TJX's sales of Carole Little and St. Tropez-West branded merchandise totaled $80.7 million as compared to $71.6 million in Fiscal 2010 and $56.6 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	As an incentive for our licensees to achieve higher retail sales of Cherokee or Sideout branded products, some of our existing license agreements, including the Restated Target Agreement and our license agreement with Tesco, are structured to provide royalty rate reductions for the licensees after they achieve certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee or our other branded products during each fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, our royalty revenues from our licensees' retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	Therefore, the amount of royalty revenue we recognize in any quarter is dependent not only on the retail sales of branded products in such quarter but also the royalty rate in effect after considering the cumulative level of retail sales.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Historically, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S6	In Fiscal 2011, royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our contracts with Tesco because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates in the Third Quarter, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM7_P16_S7	The amount of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, our licensees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period-to-period fluctuations in retail sales of our branded products by our licensees in the specific territories in which they operate.
844161_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	represent may be the result of a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) changes in the number of product categories for which a licensee chooses to use our brands from period-to-period, which generally results in changes in the amount of inventory (utilizing our brands) available for sale from period-to-period; (ii) the number of geographical markets/territories or number of stores in which our licensees are currently selling Cherokee or our other branded products from period-to-period; or (iii) our licensees experiencing changes in retail sales levels as a result of a variety of factors, including fashion-related and general retail sales trends (See Item 1A. Business "Risk Factors").
844161_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	In addition to licensing our own brands, we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands.
844161_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	During Fiscal 2008, we assisted Norma Kamali in locating Wal-Mart as a global licensee of the Norma Kamali brand.
844161_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	We also have provided our brand representation services for other brands, including HouseBeautiful and Latina.
844161_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Since Fiscal 2010, we have worked on several brand representation opportunities, including but not limited to Norma Kamali and Laila Ali.
844161_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	We currently expect that our revenues from brand representation licensing agreements, which totaled $2.4 million in Fiscal 2011, will decrease significantly for Fiscal 2012 as a result of the expiration of the Norma Kamali brand global license agreement with Wal-Mart.
844161_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	We continue to seek other brand representation opportunities.
844161_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	On January 28, 2011, Robert Margolis resigned his positions as Executive Chairman and as a director of Cherokee.
844161_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	In connection with such resignation, Cherokee's Board of Directors (the "Board") appointed Jess Ravich, an independent director of Cherokee, as the non-executive Chairman of the Board.
844161_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	In connection with Mr. Margolis' resignation from Cherokee, Mr. Margolis and Cherokee entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release of all Claims (the "Separation Agreement"), dated January 28, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Prior to year end, Cherokee entered into an irrevocable commitment to repurchase 400,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Margolis or his affiliates.
844161_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	In February 2011, we repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Margolis' affiliates at a per share price of $18.15, or $7.26 million in total.
844161_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	In February 2011, Cherokee paid Mr. Margolis a one-time lump sum payment of an aggregate of $2.26 million, which equates to the base salary and performance bonus Mr. Margolis would have been entitled to pursuant our former management agreement regarding Mr. Margolis' services to Cherokee (the "Management Agreement") had he served as Executive Chairman of Cherokee through January 31, 2012.
844161_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	In early April 2011, Mr. Margolis was paid his final annual performance bonus of approximately $1.8 million for Fiscal 2011 in accordance with the Management Agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	(iv) The vesting on Mr. Margolis' outstanding option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Cherokee's Common Stock was accelerated.
844161_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	(v) The Management Agreement was terminated.
844161_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Separation Agreement contains a general and mutual release of claims and covenant not to sue between Cherokee and Mr. Margolis and a mutual non-disparagement covenant, as well as a two year non-solicitation covenant of Mr. Margolis relating to Cherokee's employees.
844161_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement were approved by a special committee of Cherokee's Board of Directors, comprised of Cherokee's independent directors.
844161_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	On February 16, 2011 (the "Effective Date"), Cherokee and U.S. Bank National Association (the "Bank") entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the "Loan Agreement").
844161_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, on the Effective Date, Cherokee borrowed $10,000,000 in principal from the Bank (the "Loan").
844161_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	The Loan is evidenced by a term note in the principal amount of $10,000,000, a security agreement, a California judicial reference agreement and a continuing guaranty executed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC (collectively, with the Loan Agreement, the "Loan Documents").
844161_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Loan Documents provide for the repayment of the Loan in equal monthly installments of $277,778 plus interest over the next three years following the Effective Date, with the balance due at maturity, and with interest on the Loan calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	The Loan Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type, including limitations on our ability to incur debt or other liabilities and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $3,000,000 or in excess of $6,000,000 in the aggregate while the Loan is outstanding.
844161_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	The Loan Agreement also imposes the following financial covenants, as specifically defined therein, including: (i) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.00 to be calculated quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis and (ii) a minimum tangible net worth of at least $1,200,000 for Cherokee's quarterly period ending April 30, 2011, measured quarterly, and increasing each quarterly period thereafter by 25% of Cherokee's quarterly net profit.
844161_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	Further, as collateral for the Loan, we granted a security interest in favor of the Bank in all of Cherokee's assets, and the Loan is guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC.
844161_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	In the event of a default under the Loan Agreement, the Bank has the right to terminate its obligations under the Loan Agreement, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the Loan and exercise its other rights under the Loan Documents, including foreclosing on our assets under the security agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The proceeds from the Loan were primary used to satisfy our payment obligations to our former Executive Chairman pursuant to the Separation Agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
844161_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, deferred taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation.
844161_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
844161_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	Revenues are not recognized unless collectability is reasonably assured.
844161_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	historical revenues are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees.
844161_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as required sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year, and as a consequence such royalty rate reductions do not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	As a result, our royalty revenues from our licensees' retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease in each fiscal quarter as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Therefore, the amount of royalty revenue we recognize in any quarter is dependent not only on the retail sales of branded products in such quarter but also the royalty rate in effect after considering the cumulative level of retail sales.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	Historically, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	In Fiscal 2011, royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our contracts with Tesco because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates in the Third Quarter, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S5	The amount of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P31_S6	At January 29, 2011, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts.
844161_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
844161_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted the provision of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC" and collectively, the "Codification"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740").
844161_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Under ASC 740, tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The cumulative effect of applying ASC 740 has resulted in a decrease to our retained earnings of approximately $0.4 million as of February 4, 2007.
844161_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets as required by the ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("ASC 360"), which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.
844161_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	On January 29, 2006, we adopted the ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"), using the modified prospective method, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors for employee stock options based on estimated fair values.
844161_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Prior to January 28, 2006, the Company accounted for its fixed stock options using the intrinsic value method.
844161_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	Accordingly, no stock option expense was recorded in periods prior to January 28, 2006.
844161_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The fair value of stock options are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
844161_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the straight-line method.
844161_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statement of operations.
844161_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2011 reflect the impact of ASC 718.
844161_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of ASC 718.
844161_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Stock-based compensation expense recognized for Fiscal 2009 was $0.45 million, for Fiscal 2010 was $0.34 million, and for Fiscal 2011 was $1.83 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of our consolidated financial data.
844161_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table sets forth additional information regarding the components of sales, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Management anticipates a material and significant reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2012 in comparison to Fiscal 2011 due to certain expenses incurred in Fiscal 2011, which approximated $5.9 million, and are attributed to payments made to our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, comprised of a salary of $804,000, bonus of $1,764,000 and severance payout of $2,260,000 as well as expenses related to accelerating vesting of remaining stock options held by our former Executive Chairman and to our issuance following Mr. Margolis' departure of fully vested stock options to our incoming non-Executive Chairman, Jess Ravich, totaling approximately $1.1 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Cherokee does not have any further payment obligations to Mr. Margolis.
844161_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	In addition, management expects aggregate severance payments, aggregate bonus payments and aggregate non cash stock compensation for Fiscal 2012 to be materially lower than Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	In Fiscal 2011, our revenues totaled $30.8 million, as compared to $32.6 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers and from our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	The reduction of revenues is primarily due to challenging international economic conditions that continued to prevail throughout Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were $13.0 million, or 42.1% of revenues, and $13.2 million, or 40.6% of revenues, respectively.
844161_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Revenues from all other sources for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were $17.8 million, or 57.9% of revenues, and $19.3 million, or 59.4% of revenues, respectively.
844161_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our international licensing revenues were $14.4 million in Fiscal 2011 compared to $16.5 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Revenue from Tesco (U.K., Ireland, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Turkey) totaled $8.3 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to $12.0 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Tesco UK contributed $5.7 million in Fiscal 2011 and $7.6 million in Fiscal 2010, representing 18.5% and 23.2%, respectively, of total revenues.
844161_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The overall 30.5% decrease in revenues from Tesco was primarily due to the 24.9% decline in royalties from Tesco UK from Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	The decline in Tesco UK royalties was due to a decrease of 29.7% of retail sales from Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P46_S5	Additionally, the other Tesco territories all exhibited decreases in retail sales and royalties, with the exception of Turkey, during Fiscal 2011 as compared to Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Revenues from Zellers totaled $2.0 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to $1.4 million in Fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in Cherokee product offerings and increased marketing.
844161_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2011 increased to $4.1 million from $3.0 million in Fiscal 2010, representing a 32.8% gain.
844161_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	This total includes licensees for Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Brazil, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	During Fiscal 2011, we received royalties from brand representation licensing agreements of $2.4 million, as compared to $1.9 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our Sideout brand contributed revenues of $0.25 million during Fiscal 2011 compared to $0.20 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition, we signed a retail licensing agreement for Sideout to be sold through Soriana in Mexico and expect to begin receiving royalties during Fiscal 2012.
844161_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter royalties are earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	Our trade receivable balances of $6.6 million and $6.9 million at the end of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively, included an accrual for royalty revenues earned during the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 and these receivables were subsequently received in the following quarter.
844161_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees such as Tesco and Comercial Mexicana increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2011 were $17.9 million, or 58.1% of revenues, compared to $12.2 million, or 37.5% of revenues for Fiscal 2010, representing an increase of $5.7 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2011 differed from that of Fiscal 2010 in certain areas as follows: (i) in Fiscal 2011, certain payroll related expenses were higher than that incurred in Fiscal 2010, including one time severance accruals for our former Executive Chairman and our former Chief Financial Officer totaling $2.4 million; (ii) in Fiscal 2011, travel and entertainment expenses were higher than incurred in Fiscal 2010 due to our efforts to increase our international presence; and (iii) total marketing expenses were $0.8 million in Fiscal 2010 as compared to $1.1 million in Fiscal 2011, due to efforts related to our strategic marketing initiatives.
844161_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	The remaining marketing expenses are paid by us to certain licensees to help them increase our Cherokee brand in their respective territories.
844161_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	During Fiscal 2010, we recognized $0.34 million of expense associated with stock option compensation, as compared to $1.83 million for Fiscal 2011, which was due to our agreement to accelerate the vesting of an option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock held by our former Executive Chairman and to our issuance of a fully-vested option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock to our non-executive Chairman, Jess Ravich.
844161_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	The amount of bonus expense in Fiscal 2011 is lower than that for Fiscal 2010 due to the lower amount of EBITDA for Fiscal 2011 as a result of lower revenues.
844161_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	We expect to have a material reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2012, as in Fiscal 2011 we incurred approximately $5.9 million in one-time charges resulting from severance liabilities to former employees, salary and bonus payments to our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, and expenses related to the acceleration of vesting of remaining stock options held by our former Executive Chairman and to our issuance of a fully-vested option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock to our non-executive Chairman, Jess Ravich.
844161_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our interest and other income for Fiscal 2011 was $13,000 as compared to $24,000 for Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	The decrease in interest income in Fiscal 2011 is due to the lower average cash balances during Fiscal 2011 as compared to Fiscal 2010, and also lower interest rates.
844161_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	We had no interest expense in Fiscal 2011 or Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	For Fiscal 2011, we recorded a tax provision of $5.2 million, compared to $7.8 million for Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	Our effective tax rate was 40.2% for Fiscal 2011 and 38.3% for Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2011 was $7.7 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $12.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share for Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	We attribute this reduction primarily to weak consumer spending throughout the year and to one-time lump sum severance payment associated with the departure of our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, of $2.26 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	In Fiscal 2010, our revenues totaled $32.6 million, as compared to $36.2 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 were generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers and from our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target for Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 were $13.2 million or 40.6% of revenues and $15.2 million or 42% of revenues, respectively.
844161_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Revenues from all other sources for Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 were $19.3 million or 59.4% of revenues and $21.0 million or 58% of revenues, respectively.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our international licensing revenues were $16.5 million in Fiscal 2010 compared to $19.2 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	Revenue from Tesco (U.K., Ireland, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Turkey) totaled $12.0 million in Fiscal 2010 as compared to $15.2 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	Tesco UK contributed $7.6 million in Fiscal 2010 and $10.5 million in Fiscal 2009, representing 23.2% and 29.1%, respectively, of our total revenues.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The overall decrease in revenues from Tesco was primarily due to the 28% decline in royalties from Tesco UK from Fiscal 2009 to Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	The decline in Tesco UK royalties was due to a decrease of 27.2% of retail sales from Fiscal 2009 to Fiscal 2010 and the strengthening of the dollar during Fiscal 2010, which accounted for a decline of approximately 16% in sales and royalties during Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	Additionally, the other Tesco territories (with the exception of Ireland) all exhibited decreases in retail sales and royalties during Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S6	Revenues from Zellers totaled $1.4 million in Fiscal 2010 as compared to $1.5 million in Fiscal 2009, primarily due to a reduction in the men's and women's Cherokee product offerings.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S7	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2010 increased to $3.0 million from $2.5 million in Fiscal 2009, representing a 20% gain.
844161_11_ITEM7_P59_S8	This total includes licensees for Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Brazil, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	During Fiscal 2010, we received brand representation royalties of $1.9 million, as compared to $0.67 million in brand representation royalties that we received in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	In Fiscal 2010, Mervyn's revenues for the Sideout brand totaled zero as compared to $0.4 million in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The Company had a greater amount of earned royalties in Fiscal 2009 from Mervyns than what was reported as revenues, but because Mervyn's filed for bankruptcy in July of 2008 and later announced its plans to liquidate its operations, the likelihood of realizing such earned royalties has been reduced.
844161_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	The Company does expect to receive an uncertain amount of royalty payouts from the liquidation of Mervyns over the next 12 months, and will recognize such revenues as payments are received.
844161_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	As stated above, revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter royalties are earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Our trade receivable balances of $6.9 million and $5.5 million at the end of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively, included an accrual for royalty revenues earned during the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009 and these receivables were subsequently received in the following quarter.
844161_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees such as Tesco and Comercial Mexicana increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies (the British Pound and the Peso).
844161_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	For example, the royalty revenues from Tesco UK for Fiscal 2010 reflect an unfavorable 16.0% decline in the weighted average exchange rate for Fiscal 2010 as compared to the weighted average exchange rate used in Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2010 were $12.2 million, or 37.5% of revenues, compared to $13.3 million, or 36.8% of revenues, for Fiscal 2009, a decrease of $1.1 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2010 differed from that of Fiscal 2009 in certain areas as follows: (i) in Fiscal 2010, certain payroll related expenses were lower than that incurred in Fiscal 2009, including accrued bonus expenses, which for both years reflect only the bonus for our former CEO as contractually obligated under the terms of our former management agreement with Mr. Margolis; (ii) in Fiscal 2010, travel and entertainment expenses were lower than incurred in Fiscal 2009; and (iii) total marketing expenses were $1.0 million in Fiscal 2009 as compared to $0.8 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	The majority of the marketing expenses are paid by us to certain of our largest licensees to help them build our Cherokee brand in their respective territories.
844161_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	associated with stock option compensation, as compared to $0.34 million for Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The amount of bonus expense in Fiscal 2010 is lower than that for Fiscal 2009 due to the lower amount of EBITDA for Fiscal 2010 as a result of lower revenues.
844161_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our interest and other income for Fiscal 2010 was $24,000 as compared to $168,000 for Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The decrease in interest income in Fiscal 2010 is due to the lower average cash balances during Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	We had no interest expense in Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	For Fiscal 2010, we recorded for generally accepted accounting principles a tax provision of $7.8 million, compared to $8.7 million for Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	Our effective tax rate was 38.3% for Fiscal 2010 and 37.8% for Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2010 was $12.6 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $14.3 million or $1.61 per diluted share for Fiscal 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	On January 29, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.6 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	On January 30, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	The increase in cash and cash equivalents of $0.2 million during Fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the payment of $13.5 million in dividends as compared to our payment of $17.6 million in dividends in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	During Fiscal 2011, cash provided by operations was $12.5 million, compared to $13.7 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The primary differences in cash provided by operations include: (i) an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to an increase of $0.1 million in Fiscal 2010; (ii) a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.3 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to an increase of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2010; (iii) an increase in accrued compensation of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to a decrease of $0.4 million in Fiscal 2010; and (iv) an increase in stock based compensation expense of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to an increase of $0.3 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	Also, our deferred tax assets increased by $1.2 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to an decrease of $0.3 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	During Fiscal 2011, cash used by investing activities was $0.38 million as compared to Fiscal 2010, in which cash used by investing activities was $0.35 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	In Fiscal 2011, we did not make any trademark purchases, and the net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $63,000 for purchase of property and equipment and $0.32 million for trademark registration fees and renewal costs.
844161_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	In Fiscal 2010, we did not make any trademark purchases, and the net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $51,000 for purchase of property and equipment and $0.29 million for trademark registration fees and renewal costs.
844161_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	During Fiscal 2011, cash used in financing activities was $12.0 million, as compared to $17.6 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	During Fiscal 2011, the Board of Directors declared and paid a total of $13.5 million in dividends, as compared to $17.6 million in dividends paid in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	We entered into an irrevocable commitment to repurchase 400,000 shares of common stock in Fiscal 2011 for $7.26 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P72_S3	In August 2010, we received $1.5 million in cash related to the purchase of 81,967 shares of our common stock by our Chief Executive Officer.
844161_11_ITEM7_P72_S4	We did not repurchase nor retire any shares of common stock in Fiscal 2010.
844161_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Pursuant to the Company's Loan Documents with the Bank, the Company has borrowed a total of $10 million in principal.
844161_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Loan Documents provide for the repayment of the Loan in equal monthly installments of $277,778 plus interest over the next three years following February 16, 2011, with the balance due at maturity, and with interest on the Loan calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	debt or other liabilities and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $3,000,000 or in excess of $6,000,000 in the aggregate while the Loan is outstanding.
844161_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	The Loan Agreement also imposes the following financial covenants, as specifically defined therein, including: (i) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25 to 1.00 to be calculated quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis and (ii) a minimum tangible net worth of at least $1,200,000 for Cherokee's quarterly period ending April 30, 2011, measured quarterly, and increasing each quarterly period thereafter by 25% of Cherokee's quarterly net profit.
844161_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	Further, as collateral for the Loan, we granted a security interest in favor of the Bank in all of Cherokee's assets, and the Loan is guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC.
844161_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	In the event of a default under the Loan Agreement, the Bank has the right to terminate its obligations under the Loan Agreement, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the Loan and exercise its other rights under the Loan Documents, including foreclosing on our assets under the security agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our cash requirements through the end of Fiscal 2012 are primarily to fund operations, working capital, make payments on our term loan with U.S. Bank and at our discretion repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our Board of Directors, and, to a lesser extent, for capital expenditures.
844161_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks.
844161_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	Should an established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider such an acquisition opportunity.
844161_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements at January 29, 2011:
844161_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captions "Less than 1 year" starts January 30, 2011 and ends January 28, 2012.
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	(b) Represents future minimum non-cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facility in Van Nuys, California.
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The lease is set to expire on July 31, 2013.
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	There is one more additional 3-year option to extend this lease.
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	(c) Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, we agreed to repurchase 400,000 shares of our common stock from Mr. Margolis or his affiliates at a per share price of $18.15, or $7,260,000 in total (the "Repurchase").
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	We consummated the Repurchase on February 7, 2011, and issued promissory notes (the "Promissory Notes") to affiliates of Mr. Margolis as consideration for the Repurchase.
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S5	Under the terms of the Promissory Notes, Cherokee promised to pay the principal sum of $7.26 million plus 3% interest for the repurchase of 400,000 shares of common stock at $18.15, no later than the six month anniversary of the date of the Promissory Notes (August 7, 2011).
844161_11_ITEM7_P79_S6	The Promissory Notes were repaid in full on February 17, 2011 (See Financial Statement Note 9 Subsequent Events).
844161_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Management Agreement provides that, for each fiscal year after fiscal 2000, if our EBITDA for such fiscal year is no less than $5.0 million, then Mr. Margolis will receive a performance bonus equal to (x) 10% of our EBITDA for such fiscal year in excess of $2.5 million up to $10.0 million, plus (y) 15% of our EBITDA for such fiscal year in excess of $10.0 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	As a result, for Fiscal 2011, we accrued a bonus of approximately $1.8 million for Mr. Margolis, which is payable within 60 days of our fiscal year end and is reflected in the table above.
844161_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	Mr. Margolis' bonus was paid in early April 2011 and no further payments will be due under this agreement.
844161_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Additionally, pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Cherokee agreed to pay Mr. Margolis a one time severance payment of $2.26 million.
844161_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	As a result, for Fiscal 2011, we accrued a severance payment of $2.26 million which was paid in February 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	During Fiscal 2011, we announced and paid dividends of $1.34 per share.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	Since December 2003, we have paid a cash dividend to our stockholders for each quarter.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	However, the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependant upon our financial conditions, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	Our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S4	On January 28, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $0.20 per common share dividend which was paid on March 15, 2011 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S5	Should our future dividend payments exceed our cash from operations, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments in order to align our dividend payments with the cash flow generated from our operations.
844161_11_ITEM7_P82_S6	Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders.
844161_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is expected to be cash flow generated from operations, and cash and cash equivalents currently on hand.
844161_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other commitments though the end of Fiscal 2012.
844161_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flow generated from operations.
844161_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Some of the factors that could cause our revenues and cash flows to be materially lower are described under the caption titled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and under the caption title "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Item 7.
844161_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	As of January 29, 2011, we did not have any credit facilities or lines of credit and we are not the guarantor of any other material third-party obligations.
844161_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	As of January 29, 2011, we had payment and irrevocable repurchase obligations to our former Executive Chairman described above under the heading "Separation of our Former Executive Chairman".
844161_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2012 are lower than Fiscal 2011, we may not have cash available to continue to pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands.
844161_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2012 are materially lower than Fiscal 2011, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities.
844161_11_ITEM7_P86_S2	We believe that we will have sufficient cash generated from our business activities to support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	The benign rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	Since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees, we do not anticipate that short term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	In the third quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company adopted the Codification, which establishes the Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.
844161_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	The historical GAAP hierarchy was eliminated and the Codification became the only level of authoritative GAAP, other than guidance issued by the SEC.
844161_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	The FASB will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts.
844161_11_ITEM7_P88_S3	Instead, it will issue Accounting Standard Updates ("ASUs").
844161_11_ITEM7_P88_S4	ASUs will serve to update the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide the bases for conclusions on change(s) in the Codification.
844161_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	The Codification is effective for all financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
844161_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	The adoption of the Codification did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	However, references to specific accounting standards in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements have been changed to refer to the appropriate section of the Codification.
844161_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	In February 2007, the FASB issued ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments ("ASC 825").
844161_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	ASC 825 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and permits entities to make an irrevocable election to measure certain financial instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
844161_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be included in net earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
844161_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	ASC 825 became effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year 2008 and has not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	In December 2007, the FASB issued ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"), which improves the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
844161_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	ASC 805 requires acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition.
844161_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
844161_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	We do not expect the adoption of ASC 805 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820").
844161_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	ASC 820 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.
844161_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy.
844161_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	ASC 820 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
844161_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	We adopted ASC 820 on the first day of Fiscal 2009, and this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
844161_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions with our licensees, as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved by our licensees in any given fiscal year, historically our first quarter has been our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter has been our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters have been our lowest quarters.
844161_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees.
844161_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	In Fiscal 2011, royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our contracts because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates in the Third Quarter, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high-quality issuers.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency: We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For Fiscal 2011, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 46.7% of our consolidated revenues.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	For Fiscal 2011, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the US dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where we operate would have affected our revenues by approximately $1.4 million, which represents 4.7% of our total revenues reported for Fiscal 2011.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As a consequence, the past weakening of the U.S. dollar has benefited us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar has not benefited us.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	In the future, should the dollar strengthen against such foreign currencies, the total royalty revenues reported by us from such licensees would reflect such changes in the currency exchange rates.
844161_11_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Accordingly, a strengthening dollar, compared to current exchange rates, would likely result in lower reported royalty revenues than otherwise would be reported as a result of such unfavorable exchange rate movements.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures", as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We have carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 29, 2011.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
844161_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011 is effective.
844161_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Attestation Report of Moss Adams LLP.
844161_11_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On April 13, 2011, we entered into the Second Amendment to Employment Agreement (the "Second Amendment") with Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which the Employment Agreement was amended to increase Mr. Stupp's base salary from $350,000 to $375,000 annually, retroactive to his start date.
844161_11_ITEM9B_P0_S1	Due to the retroactive effectiveness of such base salary increase, we will pay to Mr. Stupp an amount of $15,096.13 in April 2011, as full payment for additional salary earned by Mr. Stupp during the period from August 26, 2010 through the date of the amendment.

844161_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
844161_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	This Separation Agreement ( Separation Agreement ) is entered into as of this 17 day of December, 2010, by and between Cherokee, Inc. ( Employer ) and Russell J. Riopelle, ( Employee ) with reference to the following facts:
844161_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	I. Employer no longer requires the services of Employee effective as of the close of business on or about Friday, December 17, 2010 (the Termination Date ).
844161_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Employer and Employee desire to compromise and, finally, settle and resolve all controversies between them, and to bring these and all other matters to a conclusion.
844161_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants undertaken and releases given herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:
844161_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Employee shall continue to be paid through the Termination Date, then Employer agrees to pay to Employee through payroll period ending April 29, 2011, twelve thousand eight hundred eighty four dollars and sixty-two cents ($12,884.62), per pay period, less standard withholdings and deductions, in accordance with Employer s usual bi-weekly payroll schedule (including payment of employee s health insurance, as is currently provided); provided that Employee s entitlement to receive such payments is conditioned on expiration of the seven (7) day period referenced in Paragraph 12.
844161_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	Except as otherwise stated in this Separation Agreement, all other benefits enjoyed by Employee as part of Employee s employment with Employer (including the accrual of vacation time, and receiving the Company s matching 401-K contribution pursuant to participating in the Company s 401-K program), shall cease as of the Termination Date.
844161_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Employee understands that Employer has paid him/her all money due and owing to him/her, including without limitation all wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, severance, accrued vacation, overtime, outstanding expenses, etc., through the Termination Date.
844161_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	The separation pay and other benefits provided for in this Separation Agreement are over and above the compensation which Employee is otherwise entitled to from the Employer and represents consideration for the release of claims set forth below.
844161_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	may in the future own or hold or have against Employer Releasees, or any of them, as of the date that Employee signs this Separation Agreement, including, but not limited to, Claims (a) arising out of Employee s employment with Employer and Employee s termination from his/her employment with Employer, (b) that Employer Releasees or any of them discriminated against Employee on the basis of his/her race, sex, religion, national origin, handicap, ancestry, sexual orientation, or age, (c) that Employee was defamed, libeled or slandered, (d) arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, The Civil Rights Act of 1991, The Americans With Disabilities Act, The California Fair Employment and Housing Act, The Employer Retirement Income Security Act, California Labor Code section 970, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act, The California Fair Employment and Housing Act or any similar state statute, and/or (e) any claim for employment discrimination, breach of contract, invasion of privacy, interference with contract, business relationships, or prospective economic advantage, emotional distress, wrongful termination, deferred compensation, stock options, bonus, or any other fringe benefits or commissions.
844161_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	Employee understands and agrees that, by entering into this Separation Agreement: (i) he is waiving any rights or claims he might have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act; (ii) he has received consideration beyond that to which he was previously entitled; (iii) he has been advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Separation Agreement; and (iv) he has been offered the opportunity to evaluate the terms of this Separation Agreement for not less than twenty-one days prior to his execution of this Separation Agreement (the Evaluation Period ).

844161_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Cherokee Inc. (which may be referred to as we, us, our or the Company) is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Sideout and Carole Little brands and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are one of the leading licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home and accessories in the world.
844161_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Cherokee was incorporated in Delaware in 1988.
844161_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our principal executive offices are located at 5990 Sepulveda Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California 91411, telephone (818) 908-9868.
844161_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	We maintain a website with the address www.thecherokeegroup.com.
844161_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
844161_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	We own several trademarks, including Cherokee , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others.
844161_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	As of January 28, 2012, we had twenty-six continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets.
844161_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners, companies, wholesalers and retailers in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores.
844161_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns us with our retailer licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We do not believe that the extra week in the occasionally reported 53-week fiscal year results in any material impact on our financial results.
844161_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods which may differ from ours.
844161_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year-to-year basis.
844161_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	As used herein the term "First Quarter" refers to the three months ended April 30, 2011; the term "Second Quarter" refers to the three months ended July 30, 2011; the term "Third Quarter" refers to the three months ended October 29, 2011; and the term "Fourth Quarter" refers to the three months ended January 28, 2012.
844161_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Cherokee brand, which began as a footwear brand in 1973, is an iconic American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual comfort at affordable prices.
844161_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	We acquired the Sideout brand, which offers an authentic, casual street and beach inspired "California Lifestyle", and related trademarks, in November 1997.
844161_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	The Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz and Chorus Line brands and trademarks were acquired by us in December 2002, and are recognized women's brands.
844161_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our primary emphasis is domestic and international Direct to Retail licensing.
844161_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	As of January 28, 2012, we had twenty-six continuing license or brand representation agreements covering both domestic and international markets, thirteen of which pertained to the Cherokee brand.
844161_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	By entering into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations and providing them the authority to manufacture and sell products with our brands coupled with our proprietary 360 turn- key solution for product development, marketing and support services, management believes stockholder value will be maximized.
844161_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our license agreements are with retailers and wholesalers on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.
844161_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Of our twenty-six licensing agreements, thirteen are Direct to Retail contracts with domestic or international retailers, ten are with a domestic or international wholesaler, and three are brand representations with third parties who have partnered, or are seeking to partner, with domestic or international wholesale manufacturers, importers and/or retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use the trademarks on certain product categories of merchandise.
844161_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We collaborate with our licensees' product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or amplify the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	All products are subject to our pre-approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards, and all marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	The retailer is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise.
844161_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	We refer to this practice as our "Direct to Retail or DTR" licensing strategy.
844161_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Wholesale licensees manufacture and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We plan to continue to solicit new licensees through our executive employees as well as using outside consultants.
844161_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our Direct to Retail licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that in the United States and other advanced or developed retail markets worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, footwear and accessories business, from product development and design, to merchandising, to sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by large retailers, who not only command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with the end consumer.
844161_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	We believe that these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by directly designing, sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than through carrying strictly private label goods or branded products from third-party vendors.
844161_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	We also expect that the enhanced profitability of our retail-to-direct strategy, coupled with the substantial marketing costs to establish and maintain an in-store brand, will continue to increase the desirability to retailers of our strategy.
844161_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	Our primary strategy is to capitalize on these trends around the world by licensing our portfolio of brand names directly to retailers, who, working in conjunction with us, develop merchandise for their stores, and to augment that portfolio by acquiring additional brands which have high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a range of merchandise categories.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	In certain select cases, such as Target and Tesco, we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees' retail sales are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease during the fiscal year as licensees exceed sales thresholds as outlined in their respective License Agreements.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	The amount of royalty revenue earned by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering the cumulative level of retail sales for the fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S4	Historically, with Target and Tesco, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S5	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees and also on the revenues we receive from other licensees that do not pay us reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S6	In our fiscal year ended January 28, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012"), royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our agreement with Tesco because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM1_P16_S7	The amount of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each applicable licensing agreement, and our agreements with many of our other licensees do not contemplate such royalty rate reductions.
844161_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	We believe that our core strengths enable us to be well positioned to expand our business and enhance stockholder value through execution of our strategy.
844161_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our global strategic initiatives currently include:
844161_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Product Design Development Providing regular, on-going creative inspiration and direction for product design in key categories.
844161_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our vision and infrastructure are transforming so that we can offer more feedback to retailers through monthly and quarterly reports and market research, the identification and sharing of global approved sourcing and manufacturing partners, and retail analytics in order to support our licensees.
844161_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	Marketing Services Evolve the brands' positioning, on a global scale, to maintain freshness and relevance for today's family and strengthening the brands' marketing platforms in collaboration with our retail partners on direct-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer basis through updated floor presentations and social and digital media initiatives.
844161_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Financial Support Services Generate revenue through the introduction of our brands into new global markets and diversify our retail network by providing compelling brand solutions that fills assortment voids and balance our distribution mix.
844161_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	In addition, the Company plans to reflect its global brand vision by launching various on-line initiatives, including investing in social media and using it as a means to get and stay closer to our customer; creating a mobile phone strategy to increase engagement, interaction and promotion; investing in paid search, search engine optimization and Web analytics; and developing an on-going email campaign that builds awareness, rewards loyalty, and drives traffic.
844161_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Management has undertaken a more proactive approach towards acquisitions in order to diversify our portfolio of consumer brands while simultaneously growing our namesake Cherokee brand and leveraging our expertise with our current global platform.
844161_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Accordingly, we continue to seek ways to expand the scope of our existing brands through new and diversified distribution channels, domestically and internationally, new and creative retail presence, additional consumer product categories, and cutting-edge marketing techniques that will increase brand recognition.
844161_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	At January 28, 2012, we had twelve ongoing licensing agreements for our Cherokee brand.
844161_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	These all represent Direct to Retail licensing agreements.
844161_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	Licensing revenues from our Cherokee brand totaled $23.2 million for Fiscal 2012, which represented 90.5% of our total revenues.
844161_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	One of our most significant Direct to Retail licensing agreements is with Target Corporation ("Target") for the Cherokee brand in the United States.
844161_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	The current terms of our relationship with Target are set forth in a restated license agreement with Target, which was entered into effective as of February 1, 2008 and amended on December 1, 2011 (the "Restated Target Agreement").
844161_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	The Restated Target Agreement grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in various specified categories of merchandise.
844161_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	In addition, pursuant to a Canada Affiliate Agreement between Cherokee and Target Canada Co., dated December 1, 2011 (the "Target Canada Agreement"), and subject to our agreement with Zellers (described below), the terms of the Restated Target Agreement will apply to the territory of Canada effective as of February 1, 2013.
844161_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	During the term of the Restated Target Agreement, in most cases, we must receive Target's consent to enter into additional licensing agreements in the United States with respect to the Cherokee brand.
844161_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Therefore, our current focus with respect to the Cherokee brand is to continue to develop that brand at Target and to develop the Cherokee brand in international markets through Direct to Retail or wholesale licenses with manufacturers or other companies that have market power and economies of scale in those respective markets.
844161_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The term of the Restated Target Agreement currently continues through January 31, 2013.
844161_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	The Restated Target Agreement provides that if Target remains current in its payments of the minimum guaranteed royalty of $9.0 million for our fiscal year ending February 2, 2013 ("Fiscal 2013"), then the agreement will continue to automatically renew for successive fiscal year terms provided that Target does not give notice of its intention to terminate the agreement during February of the calendar year prior to termination.
844161_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	In addition, effective as of February 1, 2013, the minimum guaranteed royalty for Target will increase to $10,500,000 and shall apply to all sales made by Target in the United States or in Canada as contemplated by the Target Canada Agreement.
844161_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	Under the Restated Target Agreement, Target has agreed to pay royalties based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year ended January 31 st , which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise.
844161_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Royalty revenues from Target were $13.8 million during Fiscal 2012, $13.0 million during our fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011"), and $13.2 million during our fiscal year ended January 30, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010"), which accounted for 54%, 42%, and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The termination of the Restated Target Agreement would have a material adverse effect on our business (See Item 1A, "Risk Factors").
844161_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	As of January 28, 2012, we had eleven international license agreements for the Cherokee brand (Tesco, Zellers, Comercial Mexicana, Pick 'N Pay, Falabella, Shufersal LTD., Arvind Mills, Eroski, RT-Mart, Nishimatsuya and Magnit).
844161_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	We have previously entered into a Direct to Retail licensing agreement for the Cherokee brand with Great Britain's Tesco Stores Limited ("Tesco"), pursuant to which Tesco currently has exclusive rights to a wide range of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United Kingdom and certain other countries in Europe and is obligated to pay us a royalty based upon a percentage of its net sales of Cherokee branded products in those countries.
844161_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	The term of the Tesco agreement currently expires on January 31, 2014, and Tesco has several options to extend this term.
844161_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	Royalty revenues from Tesco totaled $2.8 million in Fiscal 2012, $8.3 million in Fiscal 2011, and $12.0 million in Fiscal 2010, which accounted for 11%, 27%, and 37% respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_12_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe the decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products over the previous three fiscal years is primarily due to Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the childrens product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We have previously entered into a Direct to Retail licensing agreement for the Cherokee brand with Zellers Inc. ("Zellers"), a Canadian retailer that is a division of Hudson's Bay Company.
844161_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Zellers was previously granted the exclusive right in Canada to use the Cherokee brand and related trademarks in connection with a broad range of categories of merchandise.
844161_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	The term of such agreement continues through January 31, 2014.
844161_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	In addition, in June 2011 Zellers agreed that its grant of exclusivity within the territory of Canada shall not preclude us from entering into an agreement with Target for the territory of Canada and consequently, in December 2011, Cherokee and Target entered into the Target Canada Agreement.
844161_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Royalty revenues from Zellers totaled $2.1 million in Fiscal 2012, $2.0 million in Fiscal 2011, and $1.4 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	In January 2011, Target entered into an agreement with Zellers to acquire leasehold interests in approximately 220 stores for $1.8 billion, allowing Target to open its first stores in Canada beginning in 2013.
844161_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Target expects to open 150 stores throughout Canada in 2013.
844161_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Sales of Cherokee-branded products in Canada in 2013 will be governed by the terms of our existing Restated License Agreement with Target, as amended by the Target Canada Agreement.
844161_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	Pursuant to the Target Canada Agreement, both Target (pursuant to the Target Canada Agreement) and Zellers (pursuant to our existing agreement with Zellers) may sell Cherokee branded products in Canada until the earlier of February 1, 2014 or the termination of our agreement with Zellers, and thereafter Target will have the exclusive right to sell Cherokee-branded products within the territory of Canada.
844161_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	We continue to solicit additional licensees for the Cherokee brand internationally.
844161_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	In addition to acquiring brands and licensing our own brands, we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands.
844161_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Generally, when representing brands, we perform a range of services including marketing of brands, solicitation of licensees, contract negotiations, and administration and maintenance of license or distribution agreements.
844161_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	In return for our services, we normally receive a certain percentage of the net royalties generated by the brands we represent and sign to a license agreement.
844161_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	We typically work on several select brand representation opportunities during each fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	During Fiscal 2012, we received a total of $16.0 million in aggregate royalties from our United States Direct to Retail license agreements and brand representation contracts, which accounted for 62% of our consolidated revenues during such period.
844161_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	During Fiscal 2012, we received $9.6 million in aggregate royalties from our international license agreements, which accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenues during such period.
844161_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	We hold various trademarks including Cherokee , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in a number of other countries.
844161_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	We also hold trademark applications for Cherokee, Sideout and Sideout Sport, Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, Chorus Line and All That Jazz in numerous countries.
844161_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of our trademarks, and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of the licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our Cherokee, Sideout, Carole Little and other brands are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66, developed by retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of directly sourced merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Therefore, our success is dependent on our licensees' ability to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Companies such as Iconix Brand Group, Phillips-Van Heusen, Perry Ellis International, VF Corp. and other companies owning established trademarks have and could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	As of January 28, 2012, we employed twenty-one persons.
844161_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
844161_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees of the Company.
844161_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	We consider our business activities to constitute a single segment.
844161_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	A summary of our revenues and assets by geographic area is set forth in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
844161_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act available free of charge on our website at www.thecherokeegroup.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these materials with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

844161_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	You can obtain additional information about the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

844161_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition And Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional risks and uncertainties applicable to us.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66, developed by retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de-emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands, and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of ours.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There are numerous risk factors that apply to the businesses of retailers that can affect their level of sales of products that carry our brands.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Any decline in sales by our licensees can adversely affect our revenues.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	that impact supply chains and transport vendors; the impact of excess retail capacity; changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; material acquisitions or dispositions; investments in new business strategies; the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; and natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers, including our existing retail partners, competing for limited floor pad and rack space.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our business is largely dependent on royalties from one licensee, Target, which accounted for 54% of our consolidated licensing revenues in Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	During Fiscal 2012, 54% of our licensing revenues were generated from Target.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow under the Restated Target Agreement if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products while continuing to pay the minimum royalties of $9.0 million per fiscal year required under such agreement.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Replacing the royalty payments received from Target would be a significant challenge and no assurances can be made that we would be successful in doing so.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The termination of this license agreement would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may affect our licensees' sales.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Consumer spending is showing signs of stabilization and in some cases improvement; however it is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain, or increase our revenues.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We hold various trademarks including Cherokee, Sideout, Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other countries.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We also hold several trademark applications for Cherokee and Sideout in approximately 100 countries.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	There can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In addition, the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our recently purchased Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that was fully implemented as of the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark DiSiena, our Chief Financial Officer.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We currently have debt of approximately $7,000,000 in aggregate principal and we are subject to various restrictive covenants while such debt is outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In Fiscal 2011, we entered into a term loan agreement with U.S. Bank (the "Bank"), as amended on September 6, 2011 and as amended and restated on December 7, 2011, pursuant to which we have currently borrowed $7,000,000 in aggregate principal (as currently in effect, the "Loan Facility"), consisting of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $5,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2013 (the "Two Year Facility") and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $2,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2015 (the "Four Year Facility").
844161_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The Two Year Facility does not require principal payments prior it its maturity and bears interest to be paid in monthly installments, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.00% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The Four Year Facility requires principal to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $41,666.67, plus interest, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The Loan Facility is secured by all of Cherokee's assets and guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P25_S4	The Loan Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type, including limitations on our ability to incur debt or other liabilities, a requirement that we maintain cash deposits of at least $5,000,000, covenants regarding our profitability and our ability to satisfy our fixed financing expenses in each quarterly period, and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $5,000,000 or in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate while the Loan Facility is outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our failure to comply with the terms of our Loan Facility could result in a material adverse effect to our business, including our financial condition and our liquidity.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	From time to time we may consider engaging in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of brands, intellectual property rights or other assets.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including, among others, exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired brands, intellectual property rights or other assets, difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Accordingly, although we may not choose to undertake or may not be able to successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of applicable Cherokee-branded products and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on such initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long term, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so or that such initiatives will result in the benefits to us that they are intended to generate.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Although we have paid dividends during each quarter since December 2003, and including during the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends, or that we will continue to pay dividends with the cash that we do generate as a result of a various factors, such as our existing debt and any business or strategic opportunities that may arise, as determined by our Board of Directors.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our ability to generate excess cash from our operations in the future is dependent upon a variety of factors, including Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In Fiscal 2012, we paid a total of $6.7 million in dividends, which was less than our net income of $7.5 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Should our cash from operations be lower in future periods, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or by our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, our existing license agreements, our existing brand representations, new license agreements, new brand representations or strategic alliances or other agreements, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock.
844161_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease a 10,104 square foot office facility in Sherman Oaks, California.
844161_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our current lease term ends on November 1, 2016, and we have one five-year option to renew, for which we would have to give written notice no later than nine months prior to the date that the option period would commence.
844161_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our monthly rent is currently $20,713.
844161_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	In December 2011, we also entered into a lease agreement for a 1,968 square foot office facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
844161_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our current lease term ends on March 15, 2018, and we have one three-year option to renew, for which we would have to give written notice no less than twelve months prior to the expiration of the term.
844161_12_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our rent obligations for this facility commenced on March 15, 2012 at the initial rate of $1,968 per month.
844161_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of business, from time to time we become involved in legal claims and litigation.
844161_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, based on consultations with legal counsel, the disposition of litigation currently pending against us is unlikely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
844161_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol "CHKE".
844161_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth for each of the fiscal quarters during our last two fiscal years the range of the high and low sale prices for our common stock and the cash dividends paid per share, if any.
844161_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	On April 9, 2012, the latest sale price for our common stock, reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market System, was $12.50 per share.
844161_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	As of April 9, 2012, the approximate number of stockholders of record of our common stock was 89.
844161_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	This figure does not include beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.
844161_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	On January 28, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a $0.20 per common share dividend, which was paid on March 15, 2012 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2012.
844161_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by Cherokee's Board of Directors.
844161_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	On July 22, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our then outstanding common stock.
844161_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	Pursuant to this directive, since the end of Fiscal 2009 we have used cash of $1.9 million to repurchase and retire a total of 131,549 shares of our common stock (excluding our one-time repurchase of 400,000 shares of our common stock held by affiliates of our former Executive Chairman, discussed below).
844161_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	Our Board of Directors subsequently authorized and approved the extension of the expiration date of our stock repurchase program to January 31, 2012 and increased the number of remaining shares which could currently be repurchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions to a total of 800,000 shares of our common stock.
844161_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	On January 28, 2011, we entered into a separation agreement with our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, pursuant to which we irrevocably committed to repurchase 400,000 shares of our common stock from Mr. Margolis or his affiliates at a price of $18.15 per share, or $7.26 million in total.
844161_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	The repurchase was consummated on February 7, 2011.
844161_12_ITEM5_P5_S2	On February 17, 2011, we retired the 400,000 repurchased shares.
844161_12_ITEM5_P5_S3	We did not otherwise authorize or consummate any repurchases of our common stock during Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	During the First Quarter we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
844161_12_ITEM5_P6_S1	During the Second Quarter, we purchased and retired approximately 24,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.47.
844161_12_ITEM5_P6_S2	During the Third Quarter, we purchased and retired approximately 108,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $13.85.
844161_12_ITEM5_P6_S3	During the Fourth Quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
844161_12_ITEM5_P6_S4	During Fiscal 2010, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
844161_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	Continued repurchases of our stock, if any, will be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions.
844161_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly-traded licensing companies exists; hence, we compared the return on investment in our stock to the S P 100-LTD and NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX.
844161_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing February 3, 2007 and ending on January 28, 2012.
844161_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	The data set forth below assumes the value of an investment in our common stock and each Index was $100 on February 3, 2007.
844161_12_ITEM5_P9_S2	The data set forth below also assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.

844161_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of the apparel industry and the retail industry, the overall level of consumer spending and our exposure to general economic conditions, the effect of intense competition we face from other apparel lines both within and outside of Target, adverse changes in licensee or consumer acceptance of products bearing the Cherokee brand or our other brands as a result of fashion trends or otherwise, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the ability and/or commitment of our licensees to design, manufacture and market Cherokee or our other branded products, our dependence on Target for a substantial portion of our revenues, our dependence on our key management personnel, the success of our strategic and marketing initiatives, the possibility that we may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses or present significant distractions to our management, any adverse determination of claims, liabilities or litigation, the requirements under our term loan with U.S. Bank, our ability to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are superior to those of our common stock, our payment or non-payment of dividends in future periods and the volatility in the trading price of our common stock.
844161_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Several of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail under "Item 1A. Business Risk Factors" as well as in the discussion and analysis below.
844161_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	You should however, understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties and you should not consider the risks and uncertainties identified by us to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties that could materially affect us.
844161_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements we make herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong.
844161_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events and developments.
844161_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
844161_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Since May 1995, we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent.
844161_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our operating strategy emphasizes domestic and international Direct to Retail and wholesale licensing, whereby we grant wholesalers and retailers the license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Target currently has approximately 1,770 stores in the United States.
844161_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target increased in the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012") by 13% to $925.4 million from the $816.8 million reported in the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011").
844161_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The increase in retail sales is attributable to an increase in product categories as well as an overall increase in sales within certain product categories.
844161_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	Cherokee continues to be allotted more floor space in the children's category than any other brand at Target.
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products pursuant to our restated license agreement with Target (the "Restated Target Agreement").
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Restated Target Agreement is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products during each fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	In Fiscal 2012, Target reached the guaranteed minimum yearly royalty amount of $9.0 million in the three month period ended October 29, 2011 (the "Third Quarter").
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Based upon our new strategic initiatives, we believe that our future revenues from Target may increase as compared to those reported in Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	Because we do not have direct oversight over Target, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given future period.
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	However, beginning in Fiscal 2012, we began providing new suggested guidance to Target in the marketing and sales of Cherokee branded products.
844161_12_ITEM7_P6_S6	We expect to continue to work with Target in future periods to provide guidance on how to improve sales of Cherokee branded products.
844161_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved, in terms of future royalty revenues that we expect to receive from Target, we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter, and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $13.8 million in Fiscal 2012, $13.0 million in Fiscal 2011, and $13.2 million Fiscal 2010, which accounted for 54%, 42%, and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2012 were $11.8 million, during Fiscal 2011 were $17.8 million, and during Fiscal 2010 were $19.3 million, which accounted for 46%, 58% and 59%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We attribute this decline in revenues generated from licensing agreements other than our agreement with Target primarily to the declines in sales reported by Tesco, which began in Fiscal 2010 and continued throughout Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the Fourth Quarter totaled $342.8 million compared to $271.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and $264.0 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, increasing approximately 26% and 3%, respectively.
844161_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $3.6 million for the Fourth Quarter, $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, increasing approximately 10% and 14%, respectively.
844161_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Overall, Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during Fiscal 2012 were higher than Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 and as a result, our royalty revenues from Target for Fiscal 2012 were higher than the royalty revenues reported in Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2012 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $10.6 million in the Fourth Quarter, as compared to $75.7 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and $146.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	For Fiscal 2012, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $152.7 million as compared to $404.0 million in Fiscal 2011 and $633.0 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	We believe the decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products is primarily due to Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the childrens product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.2 million for the Fourth Quarter, $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $2.8 million for Fiscal 2012, $8.3 million for Fiscal 2011 and $12.0 million for Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Based upon the recent decline of our revenues received from Tesco for retail sales in the U.K. and other territories, and the unsettled economic climate in Europe, it is likely that our revenues in Fiscal 2013 from Tesco will decline or remain flat from those of Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	In addition to the UK, Tesco continues to sell Cherokee branded products in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey and Ireland.
844161_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were approximately $29.9 million during the Fourth Quarter compared to $29.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and $22.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	For Fiscal 2012, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $104.8 million as compared to $98.7 million in Fiscal 2011 and $72.4 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	The increase in Zellers' retail sales of the Cherokee branded products is attributed to the increase in childrens product categories as well as Zellers' continued marketing and promotion of the Cherokee brand.
844161_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	During the Fourth Quarter, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $423.7 million versus $416.7 million and $462.4 million in total retail sales for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively.
844161_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	For Fiscal 2012, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled over $1.3 billion, which was below the $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively.
844161_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We attribute the decline in total worldwide sales merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand primarily to the decline in Tesco's sales commencing in Fiscal 2010 and continuing through Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	In certain select cases, such as Target and Tesco, we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees' retail sales are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease during the fiscal year as licensees exceed sales thresholds as outlined in their respective License Agreements.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	The amount of royalty revenue earned by us in any quarter is dependent not only on retail sales in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering the cumulative level of retail sales for the fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	Historically, with Target and Tesco, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees and also on the revenues we receive from other licensees that do not pay us reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	In Fiscal 2012, royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our agreement with Tesco because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM7_P16_S7	The amount of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each applicable licensing agreement, and our agreements with many of our other licensees do not contemplate such royalty rate reductions.
844161_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, our licensees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period-to-period fluctuations in retail sales of our branded products by our licensees in the specific territories in which they operate.
844161_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	As a result, and except as noted elsewhere in Cherokee's comparisons of its three most recently completed fiscal years, Cherokee does not have sufficient information required to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or product mix by our licensees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Fluctuations in retail sales of Cherokee branded products or other product brands that we own or represent may be the result of a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) changes in the number of product categories for which a licensee chooses to use our brands from period-to-period, which generally results in changes in the amount of inventory (utilizing our brands) available for sale from period-to-period; (ii) the number of geographical markets/territories or number of stores in which our licensees are currently selling Cherokee or our other branded products from period-to-period; or (iii) our licensees experiencing changes in retail sales levels as a result of a variety of factors, including fashion-related and general retail sales trends (See Item 1A. Business "Risk Factors").
844161_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our disclosure related to the sales of our international licensees through this Annual Report on Form 10-K is denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
844161_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	In arriving at such denominations, Cherokee receives a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our licensees which are denominated in the applicable foreign currency.
844161_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	These amounts are then converted by us to U.S. dollars using an average monthly and/or quarterly exchange rate for the purpose of the disclosure of the retail sales denominated in U.S. dollars.
844161_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	In all periods presented in this report, Cherokee does not consider the period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on accuracy of the U.S. dollar-denominated figures presented in this Form 10-K.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	On January 28, 2011, Robert Margolis resigned his positions as Executive Chairman and as a director of Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	In connection with Mr. Margolis' resignation from Cherokee, Mr. Margolis and Cherokee entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release of all Claims (the "Separation Agreement"), dated January 28, 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Pursuant to the Separation Agreement: (i) Cherokee repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Margolis' affiliates at a per share price of $18.15, or $7.26 million in total; (ii) Cherokee paid Mr. Margolis a lump sum severance payment of an aggregate of $2.26 million; (iii) in early April 2011, Mr. Margolis was paid his final annual performance bonus of approximately $1.8 million for Fiscal 2011 in accordance with the management agreement previously governing the terms of Mr. Margolis' services to us; (iv) the vesting on Mr. Margolis' outstanding option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Cherokee's Common Stock was accelerated; and (v) the management agreement previously governing the terms of Mr. Margolis' services to us was terminated.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	The Separation Agreement contains a general and mutual release of claims and covenant not to sue between Cherokee and Mr. Margolis and a mutual non-disparagement covenant, as well as a two year non-solicitation covenant of Mr. Margolis relating to Cherokee's employees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	The terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement were approved by a special committee of Cherokee's Board of Directors, comprised of Cherokee's independent directors.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, our accrued liabilities include a bonus payable of approximately $1.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for Mr. Margolis.
844161_12_ITEM7_P20_S6	Mr. Margolis' Fiscal 2011 bonus was paid in early April 2011, and we do not have any further payment obligations to him.
844161_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	On February 16, 2011, Cherokee and U.S. Bank National Association (the "Bank") entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the "Original Loan Agreement").
844161_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Pursuant to the Original Loan Agreement, Cherokee borrowed $10,000,000 in principal from the Bank (the "Original Loan").
844161_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	Pursuant to the Original Loan Agreement, the Original Loan was to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $277,778 plus interest over three years, with the balance due at maturity, and with interest on the Original Loan calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	The Original Loan Agreement contained various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type, including limitations on our ability to incur debt or other liabilities and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $5,000,000 or in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate while the Original Loan was outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Further, as collateral for the Original Loan, the Company granted a security interest in favor of the Bank in all of Cherokee's assets, and the Original Loan was guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC.
844161_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Proceeds from the Original Loan were primarily used to satisfy the Company's promissory note payable to our former Chairman.
844161_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	On September 6, 2011, we entered into an amendment to the Original Loan Agreement (the "Amendment") to (i) modify the covenants relating to, and related definitions of, the "fixed charge coverage ratio" and "tangible net worth" as such terms are defined in the Amendment, and (ii) modify the covenant relating to Cherokee's ability to make certain permitted acquisitions under the Original Loan Agreement, to permit Cherokee, subject to certain conditions, to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in amounts below $5,000,000 or in amounts below $10,000,000 in the aggregate while the Original Loan was outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	On December 7, 2011, Cherokee and the Bank entered into an amendment and restatement of the Original Loan Agreement (the "Restated Loan Agreement").
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Pursuant to the Restated Loan Agreement, the Original Loan was refinanced to constitute two term loans, for an aggregate principal amount of $7,000,000 (the "New Loan") consisting of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $5,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2013 (the "Two Year Facility") and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $2,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2015 (the "Four Year Facility").
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Two Year Facility does not require principal payments prior it its maturity and bears interest to be paid in monthly installments, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.00% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	The Four Year Facility requires principal to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $41,666.67, plus interest, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	Further, pursuant to the Restated Loan Agreement, (i) we are obligated to maintain cash deposits of at least $5,000,000, (ii) the "tangible net worth" covenant contained in the Original Loan Agreement was eliminated and (iii) the components applicable to the "fixed charge coverage ratio" covenant in the Original Loan Agreement were modified and such ratio was (i) determined to be inapplicable to the Third Quarter, (ii) fixed at 1.25x for the Fourth Quarter (calculated on a quarterly basis), (ii) fixed at 2.75x for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 2, 2013 (calculated on a quarterly basis) and (iii) fixed at 1.15x for all future quarters while any portion the New Loan is outstanding (calculated on a trailing twelve month basis).
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	In addition, a new "quarterly profitability" covenant was added, which covenant (i) is inapplicable to the Third Quarter, and (ii) requires Cherokee to achieve a minimum quarterly net profit (after tax) of $1,000,000 for the Fourth Quarter and each future fourth quarter of subsequent fiscal years, $1,700,000 for each first quarter of subsequent fiscal years, $1,400,000 for each second quarter of subsequent fiscal years and $1,100,000 for each third quarter of subsequent fiscal years, in each case while any portion of the New Loan is outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM7_P23_S6	Also in connection with, and as a condition to, the Restated Loan Agreement, we repaid approximately $775,000 to the Bank to reduce the total amount outstanding under the Restated Loan Agreement to $7,000,000.
844161_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Except as described above, the terms of the Restated Loan Agreement are generally consistent with the terms of the Original Loan Agreement, and the Restated Loan Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type, including limitations on our ability to incur debt or other liabilities and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $5,000,000 or in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate while the New Loan is outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The New Loan is evidenced by two term notes in the principal amounts of $2,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, a restated security agreement, a restated continuing guaranty executed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC, and a California judicial reference agreement.
844161_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
844161_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, deferred taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation.
844161_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
844161_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	Revenues are not recognized unless collectability is reasonably assured.
844161_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Royalty agreements that account for the majority of our historical revenues are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as required sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year, and as a consequence such royalty rate reductions do not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	As a result, our royalty revenues from our licensees' retail sales of branded products are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease in each fiscal quarter as licensees reach certain retail sales thresholds contained in their respective license agreements.
844161_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Therefore, the amount of royalty revenue we recognize in any quarter is dependent not only on the retail sales of branded products in such quarter but also the royalty rate in effect after considering the cumulative level of retail sales.
844161_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Historically, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter to be our next highest quarter, and our third and fourth quarters to be our lowest quarters.
844161_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	In Fiscal 2012, royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our contracts with Tesco because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	The amount of the royalty rate reductions and the level of retail sales at which they are achieved vary in each licensing agreement.
844161_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	At January 28, 2012, management has decided to write-off the $27,000 for Mervyn's.
844161_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Accordingly, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of year-end.
844161_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
844161_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC" and collectively, the "Codification"), Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740").
844161_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	Under ASC 740, tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets as required by the ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ("ASC 360"), which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.
844161_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation as required by ASC Topic 450, Contingencies ("ASC 450") and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	Management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company accounts for stock options under ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"), using the modified prospective method, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors for employee stock options based on estimated fair values.
844161_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The fair value of stock options are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
844161_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the straight-line method.
844161_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statement of operations.
844161_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2011, and Fiscal 2012 reflect the impact of ASC 718.
844161_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of ASC 718.
844161_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Stock-based compensation expense recognized for Fiscal 2010 was $0.34 million, for Fiscal 2011 was $1.83 million, and for Fiscal 2012 was $0.57 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of our consolidated financial data.
844161_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail information regarding the components for sales, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	The significant reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2012 in comparison to Fiscal 2011 was due to certain expenses incurred in Fiscal 2011, which approximated $5.9 million, and are attributed to payments made to our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, comprised of a salary of $804,000, bonus of $1,764,000 and severance payout of $2,260,000 as well as expenses related to accelerating vesting of remaining stock options held by our former Executive Chairman and to our issuance following Mr. Margolis' departure of fully vested stock options to our current non-Executive Chairman, Jess Ravich, totaling approximately $1.1 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Cherokee does not have any further payment obligations to Mr. Margolis.
844161_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The $5.9 million dollar reduction was partially offset by additional expenses relating to marketing and product development in the approximate amount of $3.3 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	In Fiscal 2012, our revenues totaled $25.6 million, as compared to $30.8 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 were generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers and from our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	The reduction of revenues is primarily due to the decrease in aggregate sales of Cherokee branded products reported by Tesco, which we attribute primarily to Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the childrens product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 were $13.8 million, or 54% of revenues, and $13.0 million, or 42% of revenues, respectively.
844161_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Revenues from all other sources for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 were $11.8 million, or 46% of revenues, and $17.8 million, or 58% of revenues, respectively.
844161_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Our international licensing revenues were $9.6 million in Fiscal 2012 compared to $14.4 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Revenue from Tesco (U.K., Ireland, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Turkey) totaled $2.8 million in Fiscal 2012 as compared to $8.3 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Tesco UK contributed $1.9 million in Fiscal 2012 and $5.7 million in Fiscal 2011, representing 7% and 19%, respectively, of our total revenues.
844161_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	The overall 67% decrease in our revenues from Tesco was primarily due to the 67% decline in royalties from Tesco UK from Fiscal 2011 to Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	The decline in Tesco UK royalties was due to a decrease of 58% of retail sales of Cherokee branded products from Fiscal 2011 to Fiscal 2012, primarily due to a challenging consumer environment in Europe.
844161_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	Additionally, the other Tesco territories all exhibited decreases in retail sales of Cherokee branded products and royalties during Fiscal 2012 as compared to Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Revenues from Zellers totaled $2.1 million in Fiscal 2012 as compared to $2.0 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2012 increased to $4.7 million from $4.1 million in Fiscal 2011, representing a 17% gain.
844161_12_ITEM7_P43_S2	This total includes licensees for Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Brazil, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter royalties are earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our trade receivable balances of $5.3 million and $6.6 million at the end of Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively, included an accrual for royalty revenues earned during the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 and these receivables were subsequently received in the following quarter.
844161_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees such as Tesco and Comercial Mexicana increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2012 were $14.9 million, or 58% of revenues, compared to $17.9 million, or 58% of revenues for Fiscal 2011, representing a decrease of $2.9 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2012 differed from that of Fiscal 2011 in certain areas, including (i) in Fiscal 2011, certain payroll related expenses were higher than that incurred in Fiscal 2012, including severance and bonus accruals for our former Executive Chairman; and (ii) total marketing and development expenses increases, due to efforts related to our strategic marketing initiatives.
844161_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our interest and other income for Fiscal 2012 was $25,000 as compared to $13,000 for Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	The increase in interest income in Fiscal 2012 is due to the interest received as a result of past revenue due to us as uncovered during our royalty audits of certain licensees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	We had interest expense of $252,000 in Fiscal 2012 relating to our term loan agreement with US Bank, and we had no interest expense in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	For Fiscal 2012, we recorded a tax provision of $2.9 million, compared to $5.2 million for Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our effective tax rate was 28.0% for Fiscal 2012 and 40.2% for Fiscal 2011, due to our tax refund from the Franchise Tax Board.
844161_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2012 was $7.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $7.7 million or $0.87 per diluted share for Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	We attribute this reduction in net income primarily to a challenging consumer environment in Europe.
844161_12_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our earning per share increased as a result of our reduced outstanding common stock.
844161_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	In Fiscal 2011, our revenues totaled $30.8 million, as compared to $32.6 million in Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers and from our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Similar to our comparison of Fiscal 2012 to Fiscal 2011, we believe the reduction of revenues in Fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the decrease in aggregate sales of Cherokee branded products reported by Tesco, which we attribute primarily to Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the childrens product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were $13.0 million, or 42% of revenues, and $13.2 million, or 41% of revenues, respectively.

844161_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Tesco UK contributed $5.7 million in Fiscal 2011 and $7.6 million in Fiscal 2010, representing 19% and 23%, respectively, of total revenues.
844161_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The overall 31% decrease in revenues from Tesco was primarily due to the 25% decline in royalties from Tesco UK from Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	The decline in Tesco UK royalties was due to a decrease of 30% of retail sales of Cherokee branded products from Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	Additionally, the other Tesco territories all exhibited decreases in retail sales of Cherokee branded products and royalties, with the exception of Turkey, during Fiscal 2011 as compared to Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Revenues from Zellers totaled $2.0 million in Fiscal 2011 as compared to $1.4 million in Fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in Cherokee product offerings and increased marketing.
844161_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2011 increased to $4.1 million from $3.0 million in Fiscal 2010, representing a 33% gain.
844161_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	This total includes licensees for Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Brazil, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter royalties are earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Our trade receivable balances of $6.6 million and $6.9 million at the end of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively, included an accrual for royalty revenues earned during the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 and these receivables were subsequently received in the following quarter.
844161_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees such as Tesco and Comercial Mexicana increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2011 were $17.9 million, or 58% of revenues, compared to $12.2 million, or 38% of revenues for Fiscal 2010, representing an increase of $5.7 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	Selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2011 differed from that of Fiscal 2010 in certain areas: (i) in Fiscal 2011, certain payroll related expenses were higher than that incurred in Fiscal 2010, including severance accruals for our former Executive Chairman and our former Chief Financial Officer totaling $2.4 million; (ii) in Fiscal 2011, travel and entertainment expenses were higher than incurred in Fiscal 2010 due to our efforts to increase our international presence; and (iii) total marketing expenses were $0.8 million in Fiscal 2010 as compared to $1.1 million in Fiscal 2011, due to efforts related to our strategic marketing initiatives.
844161_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	The remaining marketing expenses are paid by us to certain licensees to help them increase our Cherokee brand in their respective territories.
844161_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	During Fiscal 2010, we recognized $0.34 million of expense associated with stock option compensation, as compared to $1.83 million for Fiscal 2011, which was due to our agreement to accelerate the vesting of an option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock held by our former Executive Chairman and to our issuance of a fully-vested option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock to our non-executive Chairman, Jess Ravich.
844161_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	The amount of bonus expense in Fiscal 2011 was lower than that for Fiscal 2010 due to the lower amount of EBITDA for Fiscal 2011 as a result of lower revenues.
844161_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our interest and other income for Fiscal 2011 was $13,000 as compared to $24,000 for Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease in interest income in Fiscal 2011 is due to the lower average cash balances during Fiscal 2011 as compared to Fiscal 2010, and also lower interest rates.
844161_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	We had no interest expense in Fiscal 2011 or Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	For Fiscal 2011, we recorded a tax provision of $5.2 million, compared to $7.8 million for Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	Our effective tax rate was 40.2% for Fiscal 2011 and 38.3% for Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2011 was $7.7 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $12.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share for Fiscal 2010.
844161_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	We attribute this reduction primarily to weak consumer spending throughout the year and to the payment of a lump sum severance payment associated with the departure of our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, of $2.26 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	On January 28, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	On January 29, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.6 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 million during Fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable our repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions during the Second Quarter and during the Third Quarter for an aggregate amount of $1.9 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	On January 30, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million.
844161_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	During Fiscal 2012, cash provided by operations was $7.4 million, compared to $12.5 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	We attribute this decrease of $5.1 million in significant part to our payment of $4.06 million in Fiscal 2012 of compensation expense that was accrued in Fiscal 2011 in connection with the separation of our former executive chairman and as compared to an increase in accrued compensation of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 include: (i) a decrease in accounts payable of $0.1 million in Fiscal 2012 as compared to an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primarily to bifurcating deferred revenue as a stand alone account on the balance sheet from accounts payable; (ii) a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.3 million in Fiscal 2012 as compared to an increase of $0.3 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primarily to reduced royalty revenue due from Tesco in the Fourth Quarter and (iii) stock based compensation expense of $0.6 million in Fiscal 2012 as compared to $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primary to a one time acceleration of options vesting held by our former executive chairman and our one time issuance of fully vested options to our current non-executive chairman in Fiscal 2011.
844161_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	Also, our deferred tax assets decreased by $1.3 million in Fiscal 2012 as compared to an increase of $1.2 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primarily to compensation and state taxes.

844161_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Pursuant to the Restated Loan Agreement, the Original Loan was refinanced to constitute two term loans, for an aggregate principal amount of $7,000,000 (the "New Loan") consisting of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $5,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2013 (the "Two Year Facility") and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $2,000,000, which loan is to be repaid in full on or before November 30, 2015 (the "Four Year Facility").
844161_12_ITEM7_P70_S2	The Two Year Facility does not require principal payments prior it its maturity and bears interest to be paid in monthly installments, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.00% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P70_S3	The Four Year Facility requires principal to be repaid in equal monthly installments of $41,666.67, plus interest, with such interest calculated at a floating rate equal to either (i) the Bank's prime rate minus 0.25% or (ii) 2.75% plus the 1, 2 or 3 month LIBOR rate, as selected by Cherokee.
844161_12_ITEM7_P70_S4	Further, pursuant to the Restated Loan Agreement, (i) we are obligated to maintain cash deposits of at least $5,000,000, (ii) the "tangible net worth" covenant contained in the Original Loan Agreement was eliminated and (iii) the components applicable to the "fixed charge coverage ratio" covenant in the Original Loan Agreement were modified and such ratio was (i) determined to be inapplicable to the Third Quarter, (ii) fixed at 1.25x for the Fourth Quarter (calculated on a quarterly basis), (ii) fixed at 2.75x for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending February 2, 2013 (calculated on a quarterly basis) and (iii) fixed at 1.15x for all future quarters while any portion the New Loan is outstanding (calculated on a trailing twelve month basis).
844161_12_ITEM7_P70_S5	In addition, a new "quarterly profitability" covenant was added, which covenant (i) is inapplicable to the Third Quarter, and (ii) requires Cherokee to achieve a minimum quarterly net profit (after tax) of $1,000,000 for the Fourth Quarter and each future fourth quarter of subsequent fiscal years, $1,700,000 for each first quarter of subsequent fiscal years, $1,400,000 for each second quarter of subsequent fiscal years and $1,100,000 for each third quarter of subsequent fiscal years, in each case while any portion of the New Loan is outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM7_P70_S6	Also in connection with, and as a condition to, the Restated Loan Agreement, we repaid approximately $775,000 to the Bank to reduce the total amount outstanding under the Restated Loan Agreement to $7,000,000.
844161_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Except as described above, the terms of the Restated Loan Agreement are generally consistent with the terms of the Original Loan Agreement, and the Restated Loan Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type, including limitations on our ability to incur debt or other liabilities and limitations on our ability to consummate acquisitions in any fiscal year in excess of $5,000,000 or in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate while the New Loan is outstanding.
844161_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The New Loan is evidenced by two term notes in the principal amounts of $2,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, a restated security agreement, a restated continuing guaranty executed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiary, Spell C. LLC, and a California judicial reference agreement.
844161_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Effective October 13, 2011, we entered into an Office Lease with Tri-Center Plaza, LP (the "Landlord"), pursuant to which we have leased certain premises of approximately 10,104 square feet located at 5990 Sepulveda Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California (the "Premises") to serve as our corporate headquarters (the "New Lease").
844161_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	The term of the New Lease commenced on November 1, 2011 (the "Commencement Date"), and expires five (5) years after the Commencement Date (the "Term").
844161_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Cherokee has an option to extend the Term for an additional five (5) years.
844161_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	In addition, Cherokee has a one-time option to terminate the New Lease after the third year of the New Lease.
844161_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	The New Lease provides for base rent as follows:
844161_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	In addition, Cherokee was required to deliver a $23,313 security deposit and is entitled to a rent abatement equal to the Monthly Base Rent for months 2, 13, 25, 37, and 49; over five years the abatement totals approximately $110,000.
844161_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	On December 7, 2011, and in anticipation of our relocation of our corporate headquarters pursuant to the New Lease, we entered into an early termination agreement with Lorenz Bondy et al Partners, our former landlord, with respect to the termination of our former lease obligations regarding our former corporate offices located at 6835 Valjean Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91406.
844161_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	In connection with such termination, we negotiated for, and paid, an early termination payment amount that was less than the amount that we would otherwise be required to pay under our former lease agreement.
844161_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	The space is sufficient for the Company's needs for the foreseeable future.
844161_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our cash requirements through the end of Fiscal 2013 are primarily to fund operations, working capital, make payments on our term loan with U.S. Bank and at our discretion repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our Board of Directors, and, to a lesser extent, for capital expenditures.
844161_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	We are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks.
844161_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	Should an established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider such an acquisition opportunity.
844161_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements at January 28, 2012:
844161_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captions "Fiscal 2013" starts January 28, 2012 and ends February 2, 2013.
844161_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	(b) Represents future minimum non-cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facilities in Sherman Oaks, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota.
844161_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Sherman Oaks lease is set to expire on November 1, 2016.
844161_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	There is one five-year option to extend this lease.
844161_12_ITEM7_P82_S3	The Minneapolis lease is set to expire on March 15, 2018.
844161_12_ITEM7_P82_S4	There is one three-year option to extend this lease.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	During Fiscal 2012, we announced and paid dividends of $0.80 per share.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Since December 2003, we have paid a cash dividend to our stockholders for each quarter.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	However, the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial conditions, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	On January 26, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a $0.20 per common share dividend which was paid on March 15, 2012 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S5	Should our future dividend payments exceed our cash from operations, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments in order to align our dividend payments with the cash flow generated from our operations.
844161_12_ITEM7_P83_S6	Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders.
844161_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our primary source of liquidity is expected to be cash flow generated from operations, and cash and cash equivalents currently on hand.
844161_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other commitments though the end of Fiscal 2013.
844161_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flow generated from operations.
844161_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	Some of the factors that could cause our revenues and cash flows to be materially lower are described under the caption titled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and under the caption title "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Item 7.
844161_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	As of January 28, 2012, we were not the guarantor of any other material third-party obligations.
844161_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	As of January 28, 2012, we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2013 are lower than Fiscal 2012, we may not have cash available to continue to pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands.
844161_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2013 are materially lower than Fiscal 2012, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities.
844161_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	We believe that we will have sufficient cash generated from our business activities to support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	The benign rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a material effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	Since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees, we do not anticipate that short term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	In April 2011, the FASB issued an update to ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820").
844161_12_ITEM7_P89_S1	ASC 820 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.
844161_12_ITEM7_P89_S2	Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy.
844161_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	ASC 820 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
844161_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	We adopted ASC 820 on the first day of Fiscal 2009, and this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
844161_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions with our licensees, as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved by our licensees in any given fiscal year, historically our first quarter has been our highest revenue and profitability quarter; our second quarter has been our next highest quarter; and our third and fourth quarters have been our lowest quarters.
844161_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the product mix and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter with our licensees.
844161_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	In Fiscal 2012, royalty revenues during the Third Quarter benefited from slightly higher royalty rates applied under our contracts with Tesco because the cumulative retail sales did not achieve the applicable threshold for reduced royalty rates, as compared to the comparable period in the prior fiscal year.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high-quality issuers.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency: We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	For Fiscal 2012, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 38% of our consolidated revenues.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	For Fiscal 2012, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the US dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where we operate would have affected our revenues by approximately $0.96 million, which represents 4% of our total revenues reported for Fiscal 2012.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As a consequence, the past weakening of the U.S. dollar has benefited us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar has not benefited us.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	In the future, should the dollar strengthen against such foreign currencies, the total royalty revenues reported by us from such licensees would reflect such changes in the currency exchange rates.
844161_12_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Accordingly, a strengthening dollar, compared to current exchange rates, would likely result in lower reported royalty revenues than otherwise would be reported as a result of such unfavorable exchange rate movements.
844161_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
844161_12_ITEM8_P0_S1	During our most recent fiscal quarter, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures", as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We have carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 28, 2012.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
844161_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2012 is effective.
844161_12_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Moss Adams LLP, the registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.

844161_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
844161_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
844161_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cherokee Inc. at February 2, 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended February 2, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

844161_13_ITEM8_P8_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_13_ITEM8_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

844161_13_ITEM8_P8_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
844161_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

844161_13_ITEM8_P22_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements or disclosures.
844161_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued a final standard requiring entities to present net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).
844161_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	The new standard eliminates the option to present items of other comprehensive income (loss) in the statement of changes in equity.
844161_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	The new requirements do not change which components of comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in net income (loss) or other comprehensive income (loss), or when an item of other comprehensive income (loss) must be reclassified to net income (loss).

844161_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
844161_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	It requires entities to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by respective line items of net income (loss).
844161_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	This disclosure is required only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income (loss) in its entirety in the same reporting period.
844161_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income (loss), a cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts is required.
844161_13_ITEM8_P24_S4	The new guidance is effective for interim or fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
844161_13_ITEM8_P24_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.

844161_13_ITEM8_P26_S2	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_13_ITEM8_P26_S3	By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased and money market funds purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
844161_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer's price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
844161_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Revenues from arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received or billable by the Company in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of the Company, are deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from the Company's licensees.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company's royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company's agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand in the U.S. accounts for the majority of the Company's historical revenues and is structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	With respect to Target's sales in the U.S. of Cherokee branded products other than in the uniforms category, revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as defined sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S4	As a result, the Company's royalty revenues as a percentage of Target's retail sales in the U.S. are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease during the fiscal year as Target exceeds sales thresholds as set forth in the Company's agreement with Target.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S5	The amount of royalty revenue earned by the Company from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target's cumulative level of retail sales for Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S6	Historically, with Target, this has caused the Company's first quarter to be the Company's highest revenue and profitability quarter and the Company's fourth quarter to be the Company's lowest quarter.
844161_13_ITEM8_P29_S7	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the execution of new license agreements and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter from Target and also on the revenues the Company receives from Target or other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, including with respect to the Company's recently acquired Liz Lange and the Completely Me by Liz Lange brands as well as the Company's recent re-acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Licensing revenue is recognized gross of withholding taxes that are remitted by the Company's licensees directly to their local tax authorities.
844161_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	For Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012, and Fiscal 2011, withholding taxes were $1.0 million, $0.8 million, and $1.0 million, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Deferred revenues represent minimum licensee revenue royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non-refundable to the licensee.
844161_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	Deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Property and equipment consist of the following:
844161_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
844161_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
844161_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or retired are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gains or losses are included in current operations.
844161_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.
844161_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Computers and related equipment and software are depreciated over three years.
844161_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	Furniture is depreciated over seven years.
844161_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of five years, or the life of the lease term.
844161_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	Depreciation expense was $0.2 million, $0.1 million, and $0.08 million for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012, and Fiscal 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company holds various trademarks including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line, All That Jazz , and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in a number of other countries.
844161_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company also holds trademark applications for Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Sideout, Sideout Sport, Carole Little, Chorus Line, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz, and others in numerous countries.
844161_13_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company intends to renew these registrations, as appropriate, prior to expiration.
844161_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company monitors on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of the Company's trademarks, and relies primarily upon a combination of trademark, copyright, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect the Company's intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Trademark acquisition, registration, and renewal fees are capitalized.
844161_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
844161_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
844161_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
844161_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The carrying amount receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
844161_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Long-term debt approximates fair value due to the variable rate nature of the debt.
844161_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	The realizability of long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount.
844161_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	Long-lived assets that will no longer be used in business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the Company.
844161_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	Periodically, long lived assets that will continue to be used by the Company need to be evaluated for recoverability.
844161_13_ITEM8_P40_S3	Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections.
844161_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The estimated undiscounted cash flows used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 input, which consist of unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
844161_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	These inputs would be based on the best information available, including the Company's own data.
844161_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_13_ITEM8_P43_S3	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
844161_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
844161_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
844161_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Cherokee limits credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with quality financial institutions.
844161_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	At fiscal year-end February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the Company's cash and cash equivalents exceeded FDIC limits.
844161_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are minimal due to the limited amount of open receivables and due to the nature of the Company's licensing royalty revenue program.
844161_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support licensee receivables.
844161_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	One licensee, Target Corporation ("Target") for the Cherokee brand, accounted for approximately 55% and 67%, respectively, of trade receivables at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012 and approximately 57%, 54% and 42%, respectively, of revenues during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	Another licensee, Tesco Stores Limited ("Tesco"), accounted for approximately 3% and 4% of trade receivables at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and approximately 3%, 11% and 27%, respectively, of revenues during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM8_P46_S4	International revenues represent approximately 36%, 38% and 47%, respectively, of total revenues during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012, and Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The current terms of the Company's relationship with Target are set forth in a restated license agreement with Target, which was entered into effective as of February 1, 2008 and most recently amended on January 31, 2013 to add the category of school uniforms (the "Restated Target Agreement").
844161_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	The Restated Target Agreement grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in various specified categories of merchandise.
844161_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	In addition, pursuant to a Canada Affiliate Agreement between Cherokee and Target Canada Co., dated December 1, 2011 (the "Target Canada Agreement"), the terms of the Restated Target Agreement apply to the territory of Canada effective as of February 1, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	The current term of the Restated Target Agreement continues through January 31, 2014.
844161_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	However, the Restated Target Agreement provides that if Target remains current in its payments of the applicable minimum guaranteed royalty, then the term of the Restated Target Agreement will continue to automatically renew for successive fiscal year terms provided that Target does not give notice of its intention to terminate the Restated Target Agreement during February of the calendar year prior to termination.
844161_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	Effective as of February 1, 2013, the minimum guaranteed royalty for Target increased from $9.0 million to $10.5 million and applies to all sales made by Target in the United States or in Canada as contemplated by the Target Canada Agreement.
844161_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	Under the Restated Target Agreement, Target has agreed to pay royalties based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year ended January 31, which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise.
844161_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	Royalty revenues from Target for the Cherokee brand totaled $15.0 million in Fiscal 2013, $13.8 million in Fiscal 2012 and $13.0 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM8_P48_S4	We assumed a separate license agreement with Target for the Liz Lange and the Completely Me by Liz Lange brands in connection with our acquisition of the assets in September 2012.
844161_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Generally, the Company's Direct to Retail licensees fund their own advertising programs.
844161_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	Cherokee's marketing, advertising and promotional costs were $1.5 million, $2.7 million and $1.5 million during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	These costs are expensed as incurred.
844161_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company provides marketing expense money to certain large licensees based upon sales criteria to help them build the Cherokee brand in their respective territories.
844161_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	These particular marketing expenses paid during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 were $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and were accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses.
844161_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
844161_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	Diluted EPS is similar to the computation for basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
844161_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	However, nonvested restricted stock awards (referred to as participating securities) are excluded from the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding in accordance with authoritative guidance under the two-class method since the nonvested restricted stockholders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock as if the shares were fully vested and hence are deemed to be participating securities.
844161_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to nonvested restricted stockholders are excluded from net earnings attributable to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share.
844161_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	There is no material impact on the calculation under the two-class method.
844161_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Authoritative guidance establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources.
844161_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	For Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, the Company has no comprehensive income components and accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income.
844161_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Repurchased shares of the Company's common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired.
844161_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	When the Company reissues treasury stock, and the proceeds from the sale exceed the average price that was paid by the Company to acquire the shares, the Company records such excess as an increase in additional paid-in capital.
844161_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price the Company paid to acquire the shares, the Company records such difference as a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded, with the balance recorded as a decrease in retained earnings.
844161_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	When a lease includes lease incentives (such as a rent abatement) or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and amounts payable under the lease is included in deferred rent and lease incentives in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
844161_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	For leasehold allowances, the Company records a deferred lease credit on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred lease credit as a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of income over the term of the leases.
844161_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	On September 4, 2012, Cherokee and LLM Management Co., LLC entered into an asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which Cherokee acquired various assets related to the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands.
844161_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	As consideration for the acquisition, Cherokee agreed to pay a cash purchase price equal to $13.1 million, with $12.6 million paid by Cherokee concurrently with the closing and $0.5 million of which was placed in an escrow fund that was released on March 31, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	In addition, Cherokee agreed to pay additional earn-out payments of $0.4 million and $0.5 million (for a total of up to $0.9 million in contingent consideration), which consideration is payable upon the Company's satisfaction of certain revenues attributable to the assets during the remaining months of Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_13_ITEM8_P58_S3	In addition, as part of the acquisition, Cherokee agreed to assume the seller's obligations under various agreements, which included a consulting agreement with Ms. Lange as well as certain existing license agreements relating to the assets.
844161_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	On January 31, 2013, Cherokee and Strategic Partners, Inc. entered into an asset purchase agreement under which Cherokee acquired various rights relating to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in exchange for a cash payment of $4.25 million.
844161_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	Cherokee previously sold such assets to the seller in July 1995.
844161_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Amortization expense of trademarks was $1.5 million, $1.4 million, and $1.5 million for each of Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012, and Fiscal 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	Expected amortization of trademarks for fiscal years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and for 2018 is $1.6 million, $1.4 million, $1.3 million, $1.2 million, and $0.9 million, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	The weighted average amortization period for acquired trademarks and other trademarks were 22.1 years and 2.1 years, respectively, as of February 2, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Trademark acquisition, registration, and renewal fees capitalized during Fiscal 2013 totaled $18 million, predominantly due to the acquisition of assets related to the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands and acquisition of assets related to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	These additions included registration and renewal fees of $0.17 million for Cherokee, $0.03 million for Sideout, and $0.02 million for the brands (Carole Little, others) purchased in fiscal 2003.
844161_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	During Fiscal 2012, trademark registration and renewal fees that were capitalized totaled $0.26 million, which were comprised of registration and renewal fees of $0.21 million for Cherokee, $0.03 million for Sideout, and $0.02 million for the brands (Carole Little and others) purchased in fiscal 2003.
844161_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The income tax provision as shown in the statements of operations includes the following:
844161_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	A reconciliation of the actual income tax rates to the federal statutory rate follows:
844161_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	A summary of deferred income tax assets is as follows:
844161_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Foreign taxes include withholding required on royalty payments from foreign jurisdictions.
844161_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Deferred tax assets primarily relate to amortization of intangible assets, state tax benefits and stock-based compensation.
844161_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based upon expected future income.
844161_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2013 in comparison to Fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of settling income tax examinations with the California Franchise Tax Board in regards to the apportionment of net income.
844161_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	The settlement resulted in a tax provision decrease of approximately $1.0 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	The amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, at February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012.
844161_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	At February 2, 2013, approximately $0.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate.
844161_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
844161_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	In accordance with authoritative guidance, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income.
844161_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated statements of income for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively, was $0.1 million, $0.04 million and $0.04 million.
844161_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	As of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, respectively, the total amount of accrued interest and penalties included in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $0.3 million and $0.2 million.
844161_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Due to inherent uncertainties in estimating accruals for uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the amounts accrued by the Company.
844161_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Accordingly, the Company's provision on federal and state matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
844161_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	As of February 2, 2013, the Company does not believe that its estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
844161_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California and certain other state jurisdictions.
844161_13_ITEM8_P71_S1	For federal income tax purposes, the fiscal 2010 and later tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three year statute of limitations.
844161_13_ITEM8_P71_S2	For state tax purposes, the fiscal 2009 and later tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations.
844161_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations for each of the past three fiscal years:
844161_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	The computation for diluted number of shares excludes unexercised stock options which are anti-dilutive.
844161_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	There were 0.8 million, 0.7 million and 0.2 million of anti-dilutive shares for the fiscal years ended February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	Cherokee leases the current office building under an operating lease expiring on November 1, 2016.
844161_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	The Company also has one five-year option to extend this lease for a total of 5 additional years, to November 1, 2021.
844161_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company also leases an office in Minnesota under an operating lease expiring on March 15, 2018.
844161_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	There is one three-year option to extend this lease for a total of 3 additional years, to March 15, 2021.
844161_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	The Company also leases copiers and printers for these two offices under operating leases.
844161_13_ITEM8_P75_S3	The future minimum non-cancelable lease payments are as follows:
844161_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Total rent expense was $0.3 million for Fiscal 2013 and $0.2 million for both Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.

844161_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	On December 7, 2011, and in anticipation of the Company's relocation of its headquarters, the Company entered into an early termination agreement with Lorenz Bondy et al Partners, the former landlord, with respect to the termination of the Company's former lease obligations regarding the former corporate offices located at 6835 Valjean Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91406.
844161_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	In connection with such termination, the Company negotiated for, and paid, an early termination payment amount that was less than the amount that the Company would otherwise be required to pay under the Company's former lease agreement.
844161_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	Under the terms of the Separation Agreement with the Company's former executive chairman, on January 28, 2011 the Company irrevocably agreed to repurchase 400,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Margolis, and his affiliates, at a per share price of $18.15, or $7.3 million in total.
844161_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	The Company consummated the repurchase on February 7, 2011, and issued promissory notes to affiliates of Mr. Margolis as consideration for the repurchase.

844161_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Cherokee indemnifies certain customers against liability arising from third-party claims of intellectual property rights infringement related to the Company's trademarks.
844161_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	These indemnities appear in the licensing agreements with the Company's customers, are not limited in amount or duration and generally survive the expiration of the contracts.
844161_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	Given that the amount of any potential liabilities related to such indemnities cannot be determined until an infringement claim has been made, the Company is unable to determine the maximum amount of losses that it could incur related to such indemnifications.
844161_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
844161_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected probable favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim.
844161_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate.
844161_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	As new claims arise or existing claims evolve, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.
844161_13_ITEM8_P81_S3	The Company is also involved in various other claims and other matters incidental to the Company's business, the resolution of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

844161_13_ITEM8_P102_S2	While the grant of the Stupp Option was made outside of the 2006 Plan, the grant is consistent with applicable terms of the 2006 Plan.
844161_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	The estimated fair value of options granted during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 as of each grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
844161_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
844161_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock price.
844161_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term.

844161_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	As of February 2, 2013, we had twenty-six continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets.
844161_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners, companies, wholesalers and retailers in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores.
844161_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns us with our retailer licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our fiscal year ending February 2, 2013 was a 53 week fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	We do not believe that the extra week in the occasionally reported 53-week fiscal year results in any material impact on our financial results.
844161_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition, certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods which may differ from ours.
844161_13_ITEM1_P6_S5	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year-to-year basis.
844161_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	As used herein the term "First Quarter" refers to the three months ended April 28, 2012; the term "Second Quarter" refers to the three months ended July 28, 2012; the term "Third Quarter" refers to the three months ended October 27, 2012; the term "Fourth Quarter" refers to the three months ended February 2, 2013; the term "Fiscal 2013" refers to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2013; the term "Fiscal 2012" refers to the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012; and the term "Fiscal 2011" refers to the fiscal year ended January 29, 2011.
844161_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	During 1995 the company transformed its business model from a traditional wholesaler to a branded licensing model; thereby eliminating inventory and risks associated with manufacturing.
844161_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Cherokee brand, which began as a footwear brand in 1973, is an iconic American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual comfort at affordable prices.
844161_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	We acquired the Sideout brand, which offers an authentic, casual street and beach inspired "California Lifestyle", and related trademarks, in November 1997.
844161_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz and Chorus Line brands and trademarks were acquired by us in December 2002, and are recognized women's brands.
844161_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	In September 2012, we acquired the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, which are one of the most recognized and respected maternity brands sold throughout North America.
844161_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	We acquired additional rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in January 2013, which will expand our overall product offering.
844161_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our primary emphasis is domestic and international Direct to Retail licensing.
844161_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	As of February 2, 2013, we had twenty-six continuing license or brand representation agreements covering both domestic and international markets, fourteen of which pertained to the Cherokee brand.
844161_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	By entering into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations and providing them the authority to manufacture and sell products with our brands coupled with our proprietary 360 turn-key solution for product development, marketing and support services, management believes stockholder value will be maximized.
844161_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use the trademarks on certain product categories of merchandise.
844161_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	We collaborate with our licensees' product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or expand the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	All products are subject to our pre-approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards, and all marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	In most cases the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise.
844161_13_ITEM1_P12_S4	We refer to this practice as our "Direct to Retail" or "DTR" licensing strategy.
844161_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Wholesale licensees manufacture and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We plan to continue to solicit new licensees in new territories and additional product categories as we expand our business.
844161_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Over the past two decades the Direct-to-Retail licensing strategy has become widely accepted by retailers worldwide as it generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Typically, this differentiation also provides the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a "premium" over private label price points resulting in increased profit margins, after royalties have been paid to Cherokee.
844161_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our licensees directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating our exposure to inventory risk, while at the same time allowing our licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	The consolidation and global expansion of established retailers into new markets, such as Target Corporation's recent expansion into Canada or Tesco UK's expansion into Central Europe and Asia further expands the scope of the DTR model and provides an opportunity for further growth and expansion as retailers broaden their product assortments and geographic reach.
844161_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Many of the world's largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands within the DTR model in order to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over their peers within their respective markets.
844161_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Examples of retailers actively participating in, and benefiting from the DTR licensing model include Target, Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Tesco and C among others.
844161_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our Direct to Retail licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that for retailers in various countries worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, footwear and accessories business, from product development and design, to merchandising, to sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers, who not only command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with the end consumer.
844161_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by directly designing, sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than through carrying strictly private label goods or branded products from third-party vendors.
844161_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	We also expect that the enhanced profitability of our direct-to-retail strategy, coupled with the substantial marketing costs to establish and maintain an in-store brand, will continue to increase the desirability of our strategy to retailers.
844161_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our primary strategy is to capitalize on these trends around the world by licensing our portfolio of brand names directly to retailers, who, working in conjunction with us, develop merchandise for their stores, and to augment our current portfolio by acquiring additional brands which have high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a range of merchandise categories.
844161_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe that our core strengths enable us to be well positioned to expand our business and enhance stockholder value through execution of our strategy.
844161_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our global strategic initiatives currently include:
844161_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Product Design Development Providing regular, on-going creative inspiration and direction for product design in key categories.
844161_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our vision and infrastructure are transforming so that we can further support our licensees through monthly and quarterly reports and market research, identifying and sharing approved global sourcing and manufacturing partners, and retail analytics.
844161_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	Marketing Services Evolve the brands' positioning, on a global scale, to maintain freshness and relevance for today's family and strengthening the brands' marketing platforms in collaboration with our retail partners on direct-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer basis through updated floor presentations and social and digital media initiatives.
844161_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Strategic Sales Initiatives To generate additional revenue through the introduction of new product categories with our existing brands; the introduction of new licensees in new territories and through the acquisition of additional style-focused lifestyle brands where we can leverage our relationships and experience with current or new licensees identified through our global distribution platform.
844161_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	In addition, we plan to reflect our global brand vision by launching various on-line initiatives, including investing in social media and using it as a means to get and stay closer to our customer; creating a mobile phone strategy to increase engagement, interaction and promotion; investing in paid search engine optimization and Web analytics; and developing an on-going email campaign that builds awareness, rewards loyalty, and drives traffic.
844161_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Management has undertaken a more proactive approach towards acquisitions in order to diversify our portfolio of consumer brands while simultaneously growing our namesake Cherokee brand and leveraging our expertise with our current global platform.
844161_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Accordingly, we continue to seek ways to expand the scope of our existing brands through new and diversified distribution channels, domestically and internationally, new and creative retail presence, additional consumer product categories, and cutting-edge marketing techniques that will increase brand recognition.
844161_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Cherokee markets both owned brands and brands it represents.
844161_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	In addition to licensing our own brands, we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands.
844161_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Generally, when representing brands, we perform a range of services including marketing of brands, solicitation of licensees, contract negotiations, and administration and maintenance of license or distribution agreements.
844161_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	In return for our services, we normally receive a certain percentage of the net royalties generated by the brands we represent and sign to a license agreement.
844161_13_ITEM1_P24_S4	We typically work on several select brand representation opportunities during each fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P24_S5	A summary of our owned brands and other brand representations is included below.
844161_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	At February 2, 2013, we had fourteen ongoing licensing agreements for our owned Cherokee brand.
844161_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	These all represent Direct to Retail licensing agreements.
844161_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	Licensing revenues from our Cherokee brand totaled $24.1 million for Fiscal 2013, which represented 91% of our total revenues.
844161_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Cherokee is an iconic, American family-lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual, comfortable products at affordable prices.
844161_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Initially launched as a footwear line in 1973, timeless classics, inspired by vintage Americana while continually being updated to account for modern trends.
844161_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	After four decades, the Cherokee brand stands for confident, effortless and relaxed American style.
844161_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	This storied heritage perfectly positions the Cherokee brand for future growth and further international expansion.
844161_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Cherokee's most significant licensee is Target Corporation, who launched the Cherokee brand almost two decades ago as a multi-category product offering that encompasses apparel, school uniforms, accessories and footwear.
844161_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Internationally, additional categories of Cherokee branded products are sold including home d cor, textiles, outdoor furnishings and camping gear.
844161_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Today, Cherokee is licensed in over 40 countries and over 4,000 retail locations with blue-chip licensees.
844161_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	We continue to solicit additional licensees for the Cherokee brand internationally.
844161_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	Liz Lange, as an owned brand, has gained wide acceptance as a trusted modern "maternity and beyond" designer brand that brings women versatile, comfortable, affordable and flattering style for every stage.
844161_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	In 2001, the inaugural Liz Lange Maternity store opened in New York City and a second store opened shortly thereafter in Beverly Hills to provide stylish, well-made maternity clothes.
844161_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	Soon after that, many female celebrities and women embraced the Liz Lange brand as they choose to celebrate the "bump" and look stylish and fashionable while pregnant.
844161_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	In 2002, Liz Lange maternity debuted in over 1,500 Target stores in the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	During 2010, Completely Me by Liz Lange was launched exclusively on the Home Shopping Network in the United States and The Shopping Channel in Canada.
844161_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Completely Me brand consists of sophisticated and comfortable casual clothing and sportswear.
844161_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Conceived in 1983 by a California volleyball player, our owned Sideout brand took root at the beach, harnessing the easy spirit of California casual.
844161_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Ideal for a game of beach volleyball or a breezy vacation, Sideout products perform in quality, functionality and originality by offering casual, hip, cool clothing, footwear and accessories at affordable prices.
844161_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Carole Little was founded in 1975 by designer Carole Little through her love for contemporary clothing.
844161_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our Carole Little owned brand became recognized for colorful and unusual prints for soft 2-piece outfits and dresses.
844161_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Carole Little brand has an ageless, independent attitude, for the self-confident woman.
844161_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Inspired by the life and style of global international fashion icon, Alessandra Ambrosio, the le by alessandra brand brings a "brazil-bohemia meet Malibu-chic" collection of feminine, colorful and effortless apparel to savvy, fashion-minded women around the world.
844161_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	Like Alessandra, the le by alessandra customer has a personal style that is casual, chic and effortlessly cool.
844161_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	We are representing the le by alessandra brand and expect the line to debut during the Spring 2014 season.
844161_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our rights to receive royalties for sales of products bearing our brands are set forth in the terms of our license agreements.
844161_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Generally, royalty rates for our DTR licenses vary as a percentage of the retailer's net sales of licensed products and in some cases are calculated based upon fixed percentages of product sales.
844161_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	In other cases, the royalty rates we receive may decrease depending on the retailer's annual sales of licensed products and the retailer's guaranteed annual sales of licensed products and do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our arrangement with Target provides in significant part for royalty rate reductions once certain specified cumulative levels of sales for Cherokee branded products in various specified product categories are achieved by Target during each fiscal year and, in other cases, for fixed royalty rates that apply irrespective of sales volume, including sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and for sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category.
844161_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary in each licensing agreement.
844161_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	In order to ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license contracts include our right to audit our licensees retail sales data for our brands, to allow us to validate the royalties paid.
844161_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	We also provide exclusivity to our licensees to particular countries and product categories.
844161_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	In most cases we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum dollar amount of retail sales.
844161_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	These minimum guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	In the case of Target, its minimum royalty was $9.0 million for Fiscal 2013 and increased to $10.5 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	As of February 2, 2013 the Company had a contractual right to receive over $64 million of aggregate minimum royalty revenue through the balance of all of their current licenses, excluding any renewals.
844161_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period that has been defined in the underlying license agreement.
844161_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	During Fiscal 2013, we received a total of $17.1 million in aggregate royalties from our U.S. Direct to Retail license agreements and brand representation contracts, which accounted for 64% of our consolidated revenues during such period.
844161_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	During Fiscal 2013, we received $9.5 million in aggregate royalties from our international license agreements, which accounted for 36% of our consolidated revenues during such period.
844161_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our most significant Direct to Retail licensee is Target Corporation ("Target").
844161_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	Pursuant to our agreement with Target, Target maintains the exclusive right to the Cherokee brand in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S. and, starting in February 2013, in Canada.
844161_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	Our U.S. license with Target, excluding school uniforms, provides for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P44_S3	The current term of the Target agreement continues through January 31, 2014.
844161_13_ITEM1_P44_S4	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to Target's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our agreement with Target was most recently amended as of January 31, 2013 to include a multi-year license in the category of school uniforms following our re-acquisition of such rights from a third party.
844161_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	As part of such amendment, Target agreed to pay Cherokee an annual royalty rate for its sales of Cherokee-branded children's school uniforms products in the United States equal to a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of such products.
844161_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	For all other categories of Cherokee branded merchandise that are sold in the U.S., Target is obligated to pay royalties to Cherokee based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in the U.S. during each fiscal year ended January 31st, which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise in any fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	For Target's sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in Canada, Target is obligated to pay us a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in Canada during each fiscal quarter.
844161_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	During September 2012, we assumed an additional license agreement with Target for the U.S. covering the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands.
844161_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Pursuant to such agreement, Target is obligated to pay us a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of products bearing such brands.
844161_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Royalty revenues from Target for the Cherokee brand were $15.0 million during Fiscal 2013, $13.8 million during Fiscal 2012 and $13.0 million during Fiscal 2011, which accounted for 57%, 54%, and 42%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	The termination of the restated license agreement with Target, which was entered into effective as of February 1, 2008 and amended on December 1, 2011 (the "Restated Target Agreement") would have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	We have continuing international license agreements for the Cherokee brand with leading retailers in over forty countries.
844161_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	We license to retailers such as Tesco, RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, and Nishimatsuya.
844161_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	We entered into a Direct to Retail licensing agreement for the Cherokee brand with Great Britain's Tesco Stores Limited ("Tesco"), pursuant to which Tesco has exclusive rights to a wide range of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United Kingdom and certain other countries in Europe and is obligated to pay us a royalty based upon a percentage of its net sales of Cherokee branded products in those countries.
844161_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	The decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products over the previous three fiscal years was due, in part to Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the children's product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, and the challenging international economic conditions.
844161_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	We hold various trademarks including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in a number of other countries.
844161_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	We also hold trademark applications for Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Sideout and Sideout Sport, Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, Chorus Line and All That Jazz in numerous countries.
844161_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of our trademarks, and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Royalties paid to us pursuant to our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of the licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Sideout, Carole Little and other brands are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign brands.
844161_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66.
844161_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and the greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of directly sourced merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	Therefore, our success is dependent on our licensees' ability to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	Companies such as Iconix Brand Group, Phillips-Van Heusen, Perry Ellis International, VF Corp. and other companies owning established trademarks have entered into similar arrangements with retailers.
844161_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	As of February 2, 2013, we employed twenty-three persons based solely in the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
844161_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees of the Company.
844161_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	We consider our business activities to constitute a single segment.
844161_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	A summary of our revenues and assets by geographic area is set forth in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
844161_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act available free of charge on our website at www.thecherokeegroup.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these materials with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

844161_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional risks and uncertainties applicable to us.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The risks described below and elsewhere in this Report are not the only ones we face.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, together with merchandise bearing our recently acquired "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de-emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands, and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of our brands as our license agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing from our competitors.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers, including our existing retail partners, competing for limited floor pad and rack space.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	There are numerous risk factors that apply to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees) that can affect their level of sales of products that bear our brands.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any decline in sales by our licensees can adversely affect our revenues.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Factors that may adversely affect our licensees and their sales of products bearing our brands include the following: (i) weather; (ii) changes in the availability or cost of capital; (iii) shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; (iv) declining retail prices; (v) labor strikes or other interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors; (vi) the impact of excess retail capacity; (vii) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (viii) material acquisitions or dispositions; (ix) investments in new business strategies; (x) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xi) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; and (xii) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We rely on the accuracy of our licensees' retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Most of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands for manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands in their stores.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Under our existing agreements, these licensees pay us licensing fees based in part on the number of products sold.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We rely on our licensees to accurately report the number of units sold in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections, budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	All of our license agreements permit us to audit our customers.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If any of our licensee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business is largely dependent on royalties from Target.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target accounted for 57%, 54%, and 42%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products under the Restated Target Agreement while continuing to pay the minimum royalties of 10.5 million per fiscal year required under such agreement.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Replacing the royalty payments received from Target would be a significant challenge and no assurances can be made that we would be successful in doing so.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The termination of this license agreement would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The current term of the Restated Target Agreement continues through January 31, 2014.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, in September 2012 we expanded our relationship with Target as a result of our assumption of an additional license agreement with Target for the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of assets related to such brands.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We further expanded our relationship with Target in connection with our January 2013 acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We acquired the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands as well as our rights to the Cherokee brand for the school uniforms category in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for such brands and the school uniforms category will grow in future periods, although we can provide no assurances that such revenue growth will occur.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The failure of our licensees to sell products bearing our brands or to pay us royalties for such products could result in a decline in our results of operations.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our revenues are almost entirely dependent on royalty payments made to us under our licensing agreements.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Although the licensing agreements for our brands in most cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees to satisfy their obligations under these agreements or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Further, while we are substantially dependent on our relationship with Target, the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees to meet their financial obligations to us could materially and adversely impact our results of operation and our financial condition.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have developed a remediation plan that is designed to address these material weaknesses.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards, we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and financial condition could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, or the market price of our stock could decline significantly.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Moreover, our reputation with lenders, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may affect our licensees' sales.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Consumer spending is showing signs of stabilization and in some cases improvement; however it is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain, or increase our revenues.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with our international licensees.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We market and license our brands outside the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Many of our licensees are located outside the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	During Fiscal 2013, nearly 36% of our revenues were derived internationally.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	(iv) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (v) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property; (vi) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (vii) fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and the cost of currency exchange; (viii) potentially adverse tax consequences; and (ix) cultural differences in the conduct of business.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Additionally, and because our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively impact our royalty revenues.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, and the Chinese Yuan.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights or that we will not become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We hold various trademarks including Cherokee, Sideout, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other countries.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We also hold several trademark applications for Cherokee and Sideout in approximately 100 countries.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	There can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We may become involved in other litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer,.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may not successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from them.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We recently consummated two acquisitions; the acquisition of the Liz Lange brands and our acquisition of various rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands, or to engage in other strategic transactions, that could enhance our portfolio of products and services, or expand the breadth of our markets.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our history of acquiring and integrating acquisitions is limited, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio, which could pose substantial challenges for management.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Acquisitions and other strategic transactions can involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including, among others: (i) problems assimilating the brands; (ii) significant future charges relating the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) problems maintaining and enforcing standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems; (iv) difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses; (v) unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, including accounting and legal charges, capital expenditures, and transaction expenses; (vi) diversion of management's attention from our core business or our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with our partners; and (viii) risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transaction that we pursue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In addition, future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we finance future acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If we finance future acquisitions by issuing debt we may become over-levered and restrict our ability to operate the Company.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our operating results or financial condition.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our level of indebtedness, and covenant restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In order to fund our acquisition of the Liz Lange brands, we entered into a credit facility with JP Morgan Chase on September 4, 2012.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We increased the size of our credit facility on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The size of our credit facility totals $18.6 million, consisting of a $16.6 million 5-year term loan and a $2 million 3-year revolving line of credit.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Our indebtedness under the credit agreement could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things: making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development and capital expenditures and other business activities; making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, the terms of our indebtedness contain various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain JP Morgan's consent before we can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) consummate acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of our common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our credit agreement also imposes financial covenants, including: (i) a minimum "fixed charge coverage ratio" of at least 1.2 to 1.0 and (ii) a limitation of Cherokee's "senior funded debt ratio" not to exceed 2.0 to 1.0.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Further, as collateral for the credit agreement, we granted a security interest in favor of JP Morgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiaries, Spell C. LLC and Cherokee Brands, LLC.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In the event of a default under the credit agreement, JPMorgan Chase has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit agreement, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit agreement and exercise its other rights including foreclosing on our assets under the security agreements.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in a material adverse effect to our business, including our financial condition and our liquidity.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, particularly given the continuing credit crisis and downturn in the overall global economy.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	This may materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of applicable Cherokee-branded products and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on such initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long term, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so or that such initiatives will result in the intended benefits.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Although we have paid dividends during each quarter since December 2003, and including during Fiscal 2013, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends, or that we will continue to pay dividends with the cash that we do generate.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In addition, pursuant to our Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase, we are prohibited from paying dividends in the event that we would be in violation of our covenant regarding our "fixed charge coverage ratio" after giving effect to any proposed dividend or are otherwise then in default of such agreement.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our ability to generate excess cash from our operations in the future is dependent upon a variety of factors, including Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In Fiscal 2013, we paid a total of $5.9 million in dividends, which was less than our net income of $6.8 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Should our cash from operations be lower in future periods, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or by our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, our existing license agreements, our existing brand representations, new license agreements, new brand representations or strategic alliances or other agreements, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Further, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Subject to the approval of JPMorgan Chase pursuant to our credit agreement, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our effective income tax rates could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We may come under audit by tax authorities.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	For instance, the State of California is examining our 2009 and 2010 corporate tax returns.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S7	Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P53_S8	In addition, changes in tax rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Compliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards will increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Furthermore, with such uncertainties and following the identification of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013 (as discussed in Item 9A of this Form 10-K) we cannot assure you that our system of internal control will be effective or satisfactory to our independent registered public accounting firm.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P55_S3	As a result, our financial reporting may not be timely and/or accurate and we may be issued an adverse or qualified opinion by our independent registered public accounting firm.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If reporting delays or errors actually occur, we could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could adversely affect our financial results or result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement that we must file our financial statements with the SEC using the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
844161_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In order to comply with XBRL and IFRS requirements, we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs.
844161_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.
844161_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease a 10,104 square foot office facility in Sherman Oaks, California.
844161_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our current lease term ends on November 1, 2016, and we have one five-year option to renew, for which we would have to give written notice no later than nine months prior to the date that the option period would commence.
844161_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our monthly rent is currently $21,334.60.
844161_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	In December 2011, we entered into a lease agreement for a 1,968 square foot office facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
844161_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our current lease term ends on March 15, 2018, and we have one three-year option to renew, for which we would have to give written notice no less than twelve months prior to the expiration of the term.
844161_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our rent obligations for this facility commenced on March 15, 2012 at the initial base rental rate of $1,968 per month.
844161_13_ITEM2_P1_S3	Both agreements have provisions allowing for early termination under certain conditions.
844161_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	A former employee has retained counsel and threatened to sue Cherokee for, among other things, wrongful termination of their employment.
844161_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	Cherokee believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against any suit brought by the former employee.
844161_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
844161_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that could harm our business.
844161_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	Other than the matter referred to in the preceding paragraph, we are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we or our wholly owned subsidiaries are a party that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
844161_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol "CHKE".
844161_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth for each of the fiscal quarters during our last two fiscal years the range of the high and low sale prices for our common stock and the cash dividends declared and paid per share, if any.
844161_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	On April 19, 2013, the latest sale price for our common stock, reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market System, was $12.80 per share.
844161_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of April 19, 2013, the approximate number of stockholders of record of our common stock was 89.
844161_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	This figure does not include beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.
844161_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	On January 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $0.10 per common share dividend, which was paid on March 15, 2013 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	On April 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $0.10 per common share dividend, which is to be paid on June 15, 2013 to stockholders of record as of June 1, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements, compliance with our credit agreement and other factors deemed relevant by Cherokee's Board of Directors.
844161_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	On July 22, 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our then outstanding common stock.
844161_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	Pursuant to this directive, since the end of Fiscal 2009 we have used cash of $1.9 million to repurchase and retire a total of 131,549 shares of our common stock (excluding our one-time repurchase of 400,000 shares of our common stock held by affiliates of our former Executive Chairman, discussed below).
844161_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	Our Board of Directors subsequently authorized and approved the extension of the expiration date of our stock repurchase program to January 31, 2012 and increased the number of remaining shares which could currently be repurchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions to a total of 800,000 shares of our common stock.
844161_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	During the first quarter of Fiscal 2012, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
844161_13_ITEM5_P6_S1	During the second quarter of Fiscal 2012, we purchased and retired approximately 24,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.47.
844161_13_ITEM5_P6_S2	During the third quarter of Fiscal 2012, we purchased and retired approximately 108,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $13.85.
844161_13_ITEM5_P6_S3	During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock.
844161_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly-traded licensing companies exists; hence, we compared the return on investment in our stock to the S P 100-LTD and NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX.
844161_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing February 2, 2008 and ending on February 2, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM5_P8_S1	The data set forth below assumes the value of an investment in our common stock and each Index was $100 on February 2, 2008.
844161_13_ITEM5_P8_S2	The data set forth below also assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.
844161_13_ITEM5_P9_S0	The stock performance shown on the graph below should not be considered indicative of future price performance.
844161_13_ITEM5_P10_S0	During Fiscal 2013, we did not sell or offer to sell any securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
844161_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected consolidated financial information has been taken or derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of our results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. See "Item 8.
844161_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, other filings we may make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as press releases and other written or oral statements we may make may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
844161_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	When used, the words "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "objectives", "goals", "aims", "hopes", "may", "likely", "should" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
844161_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K include, among others, statements regarding our goals or expectations regarding our future revenues and earnings, the likelihood of increased retail sales by our current and future licensees, such as Target and Tesco, the likelihood that our licensees will achieve royalty rate reductions, our prospects for obtaining new licensees and our prospects for obtaining new brands to acquire or represent.
844161_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, achievements or share price to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or share price expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
844161_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of the apparel industry and the retail industry, the overall level of consumer spending and our exposure to general economic conditions, the effect of intense competition we face from other apparel lines both within and outside of Target, adverse changes in licensee or consumer acceptance of products bearing the Cherokee brand or our other brands as a result of fashion trends or otherwise, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the ability and/or commitment of our licensees to design, manufacture and market Cherokee or our other branded products, our dependence on Target for a substantial portion of our revenues, risks associated with our international licensees, our dependence on our key management personnel, the success of our strategic and marketing initiatives, the benefits to us of our recently acquired assets related to the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, the possibility that we may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses or present significant distractions to our management, any adverse determination of intellectual property or other claims, liabilities or litigation, our indebtedness and other requirements under our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, our future capital needs and our ability to raise funds in future periods if necessary, our ability to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are superior to those of our common stock, our payment or non-payment of dividends in future periods, the volatility in the trading price and the relative illiquidity of our common stock, unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, our ability to remediate certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our compliance with changing laws and financial standards.
844161_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Several of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail under "Item 1A. Business Risk Factors" as well as in the discussion and analysis below.
844161_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	You should however, understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties and you should not consider the risks and uncertainties identified by us to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties that could materially affect us.
844161_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements we make herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong.
844161_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events and developments.
844161_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
844161_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Since May 1995, we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent.
844161_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Our operating strategy emphasizes domestic and international Direct to Retail and wholesale licensing, whereby we grant retailers and wholesalers the license to use our trademarks for certain categories of merchandise.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our Cherokee brand is an iconic American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual comfort at affordable prices.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	We own several trademarks, including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners, companies, wholesalers and retailers in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S4	We derive revenues from licensing our trademarks to retailers all over the world.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S5	We license to retailers such as Target, Tesco, RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, and Nishimatsuya.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S6	In September 2012, we acquired the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, which are among the most recognized and respected maternity brands sold throughout North America.
844161_13_ITEM7_P4_S7	We acquired additional rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in January 2013, which will expand our overall product offering.
844161_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	In certain select cases, including Target, we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees' retail sales are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease as certain retail sales thresholds are met.
844161_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	The amount of royalty revenue earned by us from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target's cumulative level of retail sales for Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	Historically, with Target, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be the lowest quarter.
844161_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the execution of new license agreements and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter from Target and also on the revenues we receive from Target or other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, including with respect to our recently acquired Liz Lange and the Completely Me by Liz Lange brands as well as our recent re-acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	However, our licensees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period-to-period fluctuations in retail sales of our branded products by our licensees in the specific territories in which they operate.
844161_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	As a result, and except as noted elsewhere in Cherokee's comparisons of its three most recently completed fiscal years, Cherokee does not have sufficient information required to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or product mix by our licensees.
844161_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Fluctuations in retail sales of Cherokee branded products or other product brands that we own or represent may be the result of a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) changes in the number of product categories for which a licensee chooses to use our brands from period-to-period, which generally results in changes in the amount of inventory (utilizing our brands) available for sale from period-to-period; (ii) the number of geographical markets/territories or number of stores in which our licensees are currently selling Cherokee or our other branded products from period-to-period; or (iii) our licensees experiencing changes in retail sales levels as a result of a variety of factors, including fashion-related and general retail sales trends.
844161_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	(See Item 1A. Business "Risk Factors").
844161_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our disclosure related to the sales of our international licensees through this Annual Report on Form 10-K is denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
844161_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	In arriving at such denominations, Cherokee receives a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our licensees which are denominated in the applicable foreign currency.
844161_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	These amounts are then converted by us to U.S. dollars using an average monthly and/or quarterly exchange rate for the purpose of the disclosure of the retail sales denominated in U.S. dollars.
844161_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	In all periods presented in this report, Cherokee does not consider the period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on accuracy of the U.S. dollar-denominated figures presented in this Form 10-K.
844161_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	On September 4, 2012, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with LLM Management Co., LLC, pursuant to which we acquired various assets related to the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands.
844161_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	As consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to pay a cash purchase price equal to $13.1 million, with $12.6 million paid by us concurrently with the closing and $0.5 million of which was placed in an escrow fund that was released on March 31, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, we paid an earn-out payment of $0.4 million and agreed to pay an additional earn-out payment of $0.5 million (for a total of up to $0.9 million in contingent consideration), which consideration is payable upon satisfaction of certain revenues attributable to the assets during the Fiscal 2014.
844161_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	In addition, as part of the acquisition, we agreed to assume the seller's obligations under various agreements, which included a consulting agreement with Ms. Lange as well as certain existing license agreements relating to the assets.
844161_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	On January 31, 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired various rights relating to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in exchange for a cash payment of $4.25 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	Cherokee previously sold such rights the seller in July 1995.
844161_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	In connection with this acquisition, we entered into a multi-year amendment to our license agreement with Target to include the category of school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	Pursuant to such amendment, Target agreed to pay Cherokee an annual royalty rate for its sales of Cherokee-branded children's school uniforms products in the United States fixed at 2% of Target's net sales of such products and subject to a minimum annual royalty of $0.8 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	On September 4, 2012, and in connection with our acquisition of the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase, which was amended on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Pursuant to the credit agreement, as amended, JPMorgan Chase agreed to lend to Cherokee up to $18.6 million in principal, consisting of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $16.6 million and (ii) a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $2.0 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Additional information regarding the credit agreement is included our discussion of our liquidity below.
844161_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	On January 28, 2011, Cherokee and its former Executive Chairman Robert Margolis, entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release of all Claims (the "Separation Agreement"), dated January 28, 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Pursuant to the Separation Agreement: (i) Cherokee repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock from Mr. Margolis' affiliates for $7.3 million in total; (ii) Cherokee paid Mr. Margolis a lump sum severance payment of an aggregate of $2.3 million and Mr. Margolis was paid his final annual performance bonus of approximately $1.8 million for Fiscal 2011; and (iii) the vesting on Mr. Margolis' outstanding option to purchase up to 100,000 shares of Cherokee's Common Stock was accelerated.
844161_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	As of January 29, 2011, our accrued liabilities included a bonus payable of approximately $1.8 million for Mr. Margolis.
844161_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Mr. Margolis' Fiscal 2011 bonus was paid in early April 2011, and we do not have any further payment obligations to him.
844161_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
844161_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, deferred taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation.
844161_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
844161_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	Revenues are not recognized unless collectability is reasonably assured.
844161_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	Royalty agreements that account for the majority of our historical revenues are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees.
844161_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as required sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year, and as a consequence such royalty rate reductions do not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	We are responsible for the licensing and enforcement of intellectual property and pursue third parties that are utilizing our assets without a license or who have under-reported the amount of royalties owed under a license agreement with us.
844161_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	As a result of these activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	These royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently audited or reported as an adjustment to those amounts due from licensees, will be recognized as appropriate.
844161_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
844161_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy, because when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance, which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.
844161_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	We consider this to be critical accounting policy because if those estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for such assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	To date there has been no impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets for continuing operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with authoritative guidance and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for equity awards in accordance with authoritative guidance, using the modified prospective method, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors for employee stock options based on estimated fair values.
844161_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The fair value of stock options are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
844161_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the straight-line method.
844161_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statement of operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P23_S4	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if any of the estimates above require significant changes, these changes could result in fluctuating expenses that could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was $1.0 million, $0.6 million and $1.8 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of our consolidated financial data.
844161_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail information regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	In Fiscal 2013, our revenues totaled $26.6 million, as compared to $25.6 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and to a lesser extent wholesalers and our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	The increase in revenues of $1.0 million is primarily from increases of retail sales at Target including Liz Lange and other international licensees of $4.0 million partially offset by $3.0 million of decreases in retail sales at Tesco and of the Norma Kamali brand.
844161_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $411.0 million and $423.7 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	For Fiscal 2013, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues for Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Target currently has approximately 1,784 stores in the United States.
844161_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target increased in Fiscal 2013 by 17% to $1.1 billion from the $925.4 million reported in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	The increase in retail sales is attributable to increased demand for, and sales of, Cherokee-branded products in the U.S as well as an increase in product categories.
844161_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Target.
844161_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	The license is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products during each fiscal year with respect to Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S.
844161_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	We recently amended our agreement with Target to provide for a fixed royalty percentage of Target's retail sales in Canada and a separate multi-year amendment related to Cherokee branded products in the category of school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	In addition, in September 2012 we assumed a separate multi year license agreement with Target in connection with our acquisition of the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, pursuant to which Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of its products bearing such brands in the U.S.
844161_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	In Fiscal 2013, Target reached the guaranteed minimum yearly royalty amount of $9.0 million in the three month period ended October 27, 2012 (the "Third Quarter").
844161_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Commencing with Fiscal 2014, the minimum yearly royalty amount applicable to the Target agreement is $11.3 million, which includes the U.S., Canada, and school uniforms.
844161_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Based upon our new strategic initiatives and after consideration of our recent expansion of our relationship with Target to include the category of school uniforms and the territory of Canada for the Cherokee brand and following our assumption of a separate agreement with Target covering our Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, we believe that our future revenues from Target may increase as compared to those reported in Fiscal 2013.
844161_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	Because we do not have direct oversight over Target, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given future period.
844161_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	We are currently providing suggested guidance to Target in the marketing and sales of Cherokee branded products and expect this will continue in future periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved for Cherokee branded products in various categories in the U.S, we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter; and fourth quarter to be our lowest quarter.
844161_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $15.0 million in Fiscal 2013 and $13.8 million in Fiscal 2012, which accounted for 57%, and 54%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2013 were $11.5 million and during Fiscal 2012 were $11.8 million, which accounted for 43% and 46%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	We attribute this decline in revenues generated from licensing agreements other than our agreement with Target primarily to the declines in sales reported by Tesco, which began in fiscal 2010 and continued through Fiscal 2013.
844161_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the Fourth Quarter totaled $344.5 million compared to $342.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, increasing approximately 1%.
844161_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $2.8 million for the Fourth Quarter and $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, decreasing approximately 21%.
844161_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	The decrease from Fiscal 2012 was primarily due to Target reaching the volume threshold for reduced royalty rates in the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013 versus in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	Overall, Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during Fiscal 2013 were higher than Fiscal 2012 and as a result, our royalty revenues from Target for Fiscal 2013 were higher than the royalty revenues reported in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table sets forth our international licensing revenues.
844161_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2013 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $0.4 million in the Fourth Quarter, as compared to $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	For Fiscal 2013, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $15.5 million, as compared to $152.7 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	We believe the decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products is primarily due to a reduction of Cherokee branded product categories in the UK and Central European countries, Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the children's product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.2 million for the Fourth Quarter and $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.7 million for Fiscal 2013 and $2.8 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were approximately $16.0 million during the Fourth Quarter compared to $29.9 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	For Fiscal 2013, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $101.6 million, as compared to $104.8 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	The decrease in Zellers' retail sales of the Cherokee branded products is attributed to store closings.
844161_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	Revenues from Zellers totaled $2.1 million in each of Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	Beginning in February 2013, the selling of Cherokee branded products in Canada has transitioned from Zellers to Target.
844161_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2013 increased to $6.7 million from $4.7 million in Fiscal 2012, representing a 41% gain.
844161_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	This total includes licensees for Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	All of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2013 were $15.5 million, or 58% of revenues, compared to $14.9 million, or 58% of revenues for Fiscal 2012, representing an increase of $0.6 million, but a consistent margin.
844161_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Included in Fiscal 2013 are $0.4 million of expenses related to professional services for evaluating acquisitions, $0.6 million in Product Development costs, relating to the re-launch of the Cherokee brand at Tesco and future licensees, and a $0.4 million increase in stock based compensation.
844161_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing related costs of $1.2 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2013 was $0.02 million, as compared to $0.03 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2013 was $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	For Fiscal 2013, we recorded a tax provision of $4.0 million, compared to $2.9 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Our effective tax rate was 37% for Fiscal 2013 and 28% for Fiscal 2012; the majority of the difference in our effective tax rates is due to our tax refund from the California Franchise Tax Board in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2013 was $6.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $7.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	We attribute these reductions in net income and earnings per share primarily to our tax refund from the California Franchise Tax Board in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	In Fiscal 2012, our revenues totaled $25.6 million, as compared to $30.8 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 were generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers and from our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	The decline in revenues was primarily due to decreases in the royalties we received from Tesco.
844161_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $423.7 million and $416.7 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues for Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $13.8 million in Fiscal 2012, and $13.0 million Fiscal 2011, which accounted for 54%, and 42%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2012 were $11.8 million, and during Fiscal 2011 were $17.8 million, which accounted for 46% and 58%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 were $342.8 million, as compared to $271.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, increasing approximately 26%.
844161_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 and $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011, increasing approximately 10%.
844161_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	The following table sets forth our international licensing revenues.
844161_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2012 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 and $75.7 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	For Fiscal 2012, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $152.7 million in Fiscal 2012 and $404.0 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	We believe the decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products is primarily due to a reduction of Cherokee branded product categories in the UK and Central European countries, Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the children's product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 and $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $2.8 million for Fiscal 2012 and $8.3 million for Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were approximately $29.9 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012 and $29.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	For Fiscal 2012, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $104.8 million in Fiscal 2012 and $98.7 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	Revenues from Zellers totaled $2.1 million in Fiscal 2012, as compared to $2.0 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2012 increased to $4.7 million from $4.1 million in Fiscal 2011, representing a 17% gain.
844161_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	This total includes licensees for Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Brazil, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2012 were $14.9 million, or 58% of revenues, compared to $17.9 million, or 58% of revenues, for Fiscal 2011, representing a decrease of $2.9 million, but a consistent margin.
844161_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The significant reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in Fiscal 2012 in comparison to Fiscal 2011 was due to certain expenses incurred in Fiscal 2011, which approximated $5.9 million and were for payments made to our former Executive Chairman, Robert Margolis, comprised of a salary of $0.8 million, bonus of $1.8 million and severance payout of $2.3 million as well as expenses related to accelerating vesting of remaining stock options held by our former Executive Chairman and to our issuance of fully vested stock options to our current non-Executive Chairman, Jess Ravich, totaling approximately $1.1 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	Cherokee does not have any further payment obligations to Mr. Margolis.
844161_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	The $5.9 million dollar reduction was partially offset by additional expenses relating to marketing and product development in the approximate amount of $3.3 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2012 was $0.03 million, as compared to $0.01 million for Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The increase in interest income in Fiscal 2012 is due to the interest received as a result of past revenue due to us as uncovered during our royalty audits of certain licensees.
844161_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	We had interest expense of $0.3 million in Fiscal 2012 relating to our former term loan agreement with US Bank, and we had no interest expense in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	For Fiscal 2012, we recorded a tax provision of $2.9 million, compared to $5.2 million for Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	Our effective tax rate was 28% for Fiscal 2012 and 40% for Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	We attribute the difference in our effective tax rates primarily due to our tax refund from the California Franchise Tax Board in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2012 was $7.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $7.7 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	We attribute this reduction in net income primarily to the reasons noted above relating to the decrease in royalty revenues from Tesco.
844161_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	Partially offsetting this decrease in royalty revenues is an increase in net income relating to the tax refund from the California Franchise Tax Board in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	On February 2, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	On January 28, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	The $5.0 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to our prepayment in June 2012 of all outstanding principal and interest then outstanding under our former loan agreement with U.S. Bank (the "Prior Loan").
844161_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	On January 29, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.6 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	During Fiscal 2013, cash provided by operations was $9.7 million, compared to $7.4 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	We attribute this increase of $2.3 million in significant part to our payment of $4.1 million in Fiscal 2012 of compensation expense that was accrued in Fiscal 2011 in connection with the separation of our former executive chairman.
844161_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 include: (i) an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to a decrease in accounts payable of $0.1 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to increased legal fees; (ii) an increase in accounts receivable of $0.2 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to an increase of $1.3 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to reduced royalty revenue due from Tesco; and (iii) stock based compensation expense of $1.0 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to $0.6 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to our issuance of more stock options in Fiscal 2013 than in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P64_S3	Also, our deferred tax assets increased by $0.1 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to a decrease of $0.9 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to state income taxes.
844161_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	During Fiscal 2012, cash provided by operations was $7.4 million, compared to $12.5 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	We attribute this decrease of $5.1 million in significant part to our payment of $4.1 million in Fiscal 2012 of compensation expense that was accrued in Fiscal 2011 in connection with the separation of our former executive chairman and as compared to an increase in accrued compensation of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011 include: (i) a decrease in accounts receivable of $1.3 million in Fiscal 2012, as compared to an increase of $0.3 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primarily to reduced royalty revenue due from Tesco in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012; and (ii) stock based compensation expense of $0.6 million in Fiscal 2012, as compared to $1.8 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primarily to a one time acceleration of options vesting held by our former executive chairman and our one time issuance of fully vested options to our current non-executive chairman in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Also, our deferred tax assets decreased by $0.9 million in Fiscal 2012, as compared to an increase of $1.2 million in Fiscal 2011, which we attribute primarily to compensation and state income taxes.
844161_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	During Fiscal 2013, cash used by investing activities was $18.4 million, as compared to $0.9 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	In Fiscal 2013, cash used by investing activities was comprised of $0.5 million of capital expenditures on office equipment, $0.1 million net loss on retirement of assets, and $18.0 million for the purchase of the "Liz Lange", "Completely Me by Liz Lange", and "School Uniform Apparel Marks" brands and trademark registration and renewal fees for the Cherokee, Sideout and Carole Little brands.
844161_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	In Fiscal 2012, we did not make any trademark purchases, and the net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $0.7 million for our purchase of property and equipment and $0.2 million for trademark registration fees and renewal costs.

844161_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	In Fiscal 2012, we did not make any trademark purchases, and the net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $0.7 million for our purchase of property and equipment and $0.2 million for trademark registration fees and renewal costs.
844161_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	In Fiscal 2011, we did not make any trademark purchases, and the net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $0.1 million for purchase of property and equipment and $0.3 million for trademark registration fees and renewal costs.
844161_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	During Fiscal 2013, cash received from financing activities was $3.8 million, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $8.6 million in Fiscal 2012.

844161_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	In Fiscal 2012, we consummated repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.9 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	We received $0.2 million in cash for the purchase of shares of common stock by our Chief Executive Officer in Fiscal 2012.

844161_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	In Fiscal 2012, we consummated repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.9 million.
844161_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	In Fiscal 2011, we entered into an irrevocable commitment to repurchase 400,000 shares of common stock for $7.3 million in connection with the separation of our former executive chairman.
844161_13_ITEM7_P69_S4	We did not consummate any other repurchases of our common stock in Fiscal 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P69_S5	We received $0.2 million and $1.5 million in cash for the purchase of shares of common stock by our Chief Executive Officer in Fiscal 2012 and Fiscal 2011, respectively.
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	On September 4, 2012, and in connection with our acquisition of the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, Cherokee and JPMorgan Chase (or "JP Morgan") entered into a credit agreement, which was amended on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Pursuant to the credit agreement, as amended, JPMorgan agreed to lend to Cherokee up to $18.6 million in principal (the "Loan").
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	The Loan is comprised of (a) a term loan in the principal amount of $16.6 million (the "Term Loan"), with interest on each advance equal to either: (i) an adjusted annual LIBOR rate reset monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly, plus 2.75% or (ii) JPMorgan's annual prime rate minus 0.25%, with a floor equal to the 1 month LIBOR Rate plus 2.5%; and (b) a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $2 million (the "Revolver"), with interest on each advance equal to either: (i) an adjusted annual LIBOR rate-reset monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly, plus 2.25% or (ii) JPMorgan's annual prime rate minus 0.25%, with a floor equal to the 1 month LIBOR Rate plus 2.5%.
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	The principal outstanding under the Term Loan is to be repaid on a quarterly basis, commencing on November 20, 2012 and continuing through August 31, 2017, in equal principal installments of (i) $0.65 million for the period ending on February 28, 2013 and (ii) $0.89 million thereafter, together with interest payments made monthly as set forth in the Term Loan.
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	The Revolver matures in September 2015 and is to be repaid in monthly interest payments on any principal then outstanding, with the balance of any then-outstanding principal and interest to be repaid at maturity.
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S5	Cherokee paid an upfront fee equal to $0.07 million in connection with the issuance of the Term Loan and is obligated to pay a monthly non-usage fee of 0.25% per annum, in arrears, computed on the average daily unused portion of the Revolver, subject to Cherokee's right to terminate the Revolver prior to maturity.
844161_13_ITEM7_P70_S6	In addition, Cherokee is obligated to pay an unspecified amount to be determined by JPMorgan to compensate it for its loss in the event that Cherokee elects to repay all or a portion of the Loan prior to its maturity.
844161_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	The Loan is evidenced by a term note in the principal amount of $16.6 million and a line of credit note in the principal amount of up to $2.0 million, is secured by continuing security agreements and trademark security agreements executed by Cherokee and Cherokee Brands, LLC and is supported by continuing guaranties executed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiaries, Spell C. LLC and Cherokee Brands, LLC.
844161_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for loan agreements and transactions of this type.
844161_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	On February 16, 2011, Cherokee and U.S. Bank National Association entered into a term loan agreement, which was amended on December 7, 2011.
844161_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	The amended loan agreement consisted of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $5.0 million and a two year maturity date and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $2.0 million and a four year maturity.
844161_13_ITEM7_P72_S2	On June 5, 2012, Cherokee prepaid all outstanding principal and interest on the amended loan agreement.
844161_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Effective October 13, 2011, we entered into an Office Lease with Tri-Center Plaza, LP, pursuant to which we have leased certain premises of approximately 10,104 square feet located at 5990 Sepulveda Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California to serve as our corporate headquarters.
844161_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The term of the lease commenced on November 1, 2011 and expires five years after the commencement date.
844161_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	Cherokee has an option to extend the term for an additional five years.
844161_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	In addition, Cherokee has a one-time option to terminate the lease after the third year of the lease.
844161_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The lease provides for base rent as follows:
844161_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	In addition, Cherokee was required to deliver a $23,313 security deposit and is entitled to a rent abatement equal to the monthly base rent for months 2, 13, 25, 37, and 49; over five years the abatement totals approximately $110,000.
844161_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	On December 7, 2011, and in anticipation of our relocation of our corporate headquarters pursuant to our current lease, we entered into an early termination agreement with Lorenz Bondy et al Partners, our former landlord, with respect to the termination of our former lease obligations regarding our former corporate offices located at 6835 Valjean Avenue, Van Nuys, CA 91406.
844161_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	In connection with such termination, we negotiated for, and paid, an early termination payment amount that was less than the amount that we would otherwise be required to pay under our former lease agreement.
844161_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	The current office space is sufficient for the Company's needs for the foreseeable future.
844161_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our cash requirements through the end of Fiscal 2014 are primarily to fund operations, working capital, and at our discretion and subject to the terms of our credit agreement repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our Board of Directors, and, to a lesser extent, for capital expenditures.
844161_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Our Board may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant.
844161_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock are subject to negative covenants contained in our credit agreement and, assuming the satisfaction or waiver by JPMorgan of such covenants, will be made at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board.
844161_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	We are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks.
844161_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Should an established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider such an acquisition opportunity.
844161_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of February 2, 2013:
844161_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captioned "Fiscal 2014" starts February 3, 2013 and ends February 1, 2014.
844161_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	(b) Represents future minimum non-cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facilities in Sherman Oaks, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota and our copier leases for these two locations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Sherman Oaks lease is set to expire on November 1, 2016.
844161_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	There is one five-year option to extend this lease.
844161_13_ITEM7_P82_S3	The Minneapolis lease is set to expire on March 15, 2018.
844161_13_ITEM7_P82_S4	There is one three-year option to extend this lease.
844161_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	(c) Represents future interest and principal payments with respect to our credit agreement with JPMorgan.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	During Fiscal 2013, we announced dividends of $0.60 per share and paid cash dividends of $0.70 per share.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	Since December 2003, we have paid a cash dividend to our stockholders for each quarter.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	However, the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial conditions, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with our credit agreement and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S3	Our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S4	On January 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a $0.10 per common share dividend, which was paid on March 15, 2013 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S5	Should our future dividend payments exceed our cash from operations, we will reduce the excess cash on our balance sheet and our Board of Directors may elect to further reduce or eliminate future dividend payments in order to align our dividend payments with the cash flow generated from our operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P84_S6	Furthermore, should the dividend tax laws change such that taxes on dividends become higher than they currently are, we may further reduce or eliminate the dividends we pay to our stockholders in favor of other ways to increase value for our stockholders.
844161_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents currently on hand, and funds made available to us pursuant to our Revolver.
844161_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and access to funds pursuant to the Revolver will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and other commitments through the end of Fiscal 2014.
844161_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flow generated from operations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	Some of the factors that could cause our revenues and cash flows to be materially lower are described under the caption titled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and under the caption title "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Item 7.
844161_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	As of February 2, 2013, we were not the guarantor of any other material third-party obligations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	As of February 2, 2013, we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2014 are lower than Fiscal 2013, we may not have cash available to continue to pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands, and we could fall out of compliance with the terms of our credit agreement.
844161_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2014 are materially lower than Fiscal 2013, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities.
844161_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	We believe that we will have sufficient cash generated from our business activities to support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	We have agreed to certain contractual royalty rate reductions with Target for its sales of Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S. in each fiscal year, which apply for future sales as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved.
844161_13_ITEM7_P88_S1	Historically, with Target, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be our lowest quarter.
844161_13_ITEM7_P88_S2	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future.
844161_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	The benign rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a material effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees, we do not anticipate that short term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new guidance that result in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of, and disclosure about, fair value between U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Pronouncements, or GAAP, and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS.
844161_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	The new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP.
844161_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	Several new disclosures about Level 3 measurements are required, including quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs disclosed and a description of the valuation processed used.
844161_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	The new guidance was effective for interim or fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2011, with early adoption prohibited.
844161_13_ITEM7_P90_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.
844161_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued a final standard requiring entities to present net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).
844161_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	The new standard eliminates the option to present items of other comprehensive income (loss) in the statement of changes in equity.
844161_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	The new requirements do not change which components of comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in net income (loss) or other comprehensive income (loss), or when an item of other comprehensive income (loss) must be reclassified to net income (loss).
844161_13_ITEM7_P91_S3	Also, earnings (loss) per share computations do not change.
844161_13_ITEM7_P91_S4	The new requirements were effective for interim and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
844161_13_ITEM7_P91_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.
844161_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
844161_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	It requires entities to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by respective line items of net income (loss).
844161_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	This disclosure is required only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income (loss) in its entirety in the same reporting period.
844161_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income (loss), a cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts is required.
844161_13_ITEM7_P92_S4	The new guidance is effective for interim or fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
844161_13_ITEM7_P92_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high-quality issuers.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	In relation to our term loan with JPMorgan Chase, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have an immaterial impact on interest expense for the year ended February 2, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Currency: We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	For Fiscal 2013, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 36% of our consolidated revenues.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	For Fiscal 2013, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the US dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where our licensees operate would have affected our revenues by approximately $0.95 million, which represents 4% of our total revenues reported for Fiscal 2013.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As a consequence, the past weakening of the U.S. dollar has benefited us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar has not benefited us.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	In the future, should the dollar strengthen against such foreign currencies, the total royalty revenues reported by us from such licensees would reflect such changes in the currency exchange rates.
844161_13_ITEM7A_P5_S4	Accordingly, a strengthening dollar, compared to current exchange rates, would likely result in lower reported royalty revenues than otherwise would be reported as a result of such unfavorable exchange rate movements.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and procedures.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures", as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	We have carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of February 2, 2013 as a result of the material weaknesses described below.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
844161_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on our evaluation under the COSO framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013 was not effective as a result of the material weaknesses described below.

844161_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Ernst Young LLP, our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that has audited the financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Our management, with the oversight of our Audit Committee has initiated a plan to enhance our control procedures with respect to the material weaknesses identified above.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P11_S1	This remediation plan includes hiring third parties to evaluate and assist management in changing logical access controls to ensure proper segregation of duties, increased use of third party advisors with appropriate expertise to assist management with the preparation and review of our quarterly and annual income tax provisions, utilization of third party programs and resources to assist management with the documentation and validation of the stock based awards' fair value calculations, and reconciling all balance sheet accounts and credit card expenses on a monthly basis including requiring formal reviews and signoffs of the reconciliations by the appropriate level of management.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P11_S2	We believe the steps taken to date have improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, however we have not completed the corrective processes and procedures identified herein.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P11_S3	Accordingly, as we continue to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the areas affected by the material weaknesses described above, we will perform additional procedures prescribed by management and our Audit Committee to ensure that our financial statements continue to be fairly stated in all material respects.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P11_S4	If the remedial measures described above are insufficient to address any of the identified material weaknesses or are not implemented effectively, or additional deficiencies arise in the future, material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements may occur in the future and we may be delinquent in our filings.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Any unremediated material weaknesses could have the effects described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of this Form 10-K.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P13_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P14_S1	During our quarterly period ended February 2, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P15_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cherokee Inc.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P16_S0	We have audited Cherokee Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

844161_13_ITEM9A_P16_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P17_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_13_ITEM9A_P17_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P17_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P17_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P18_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P18_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P19_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P19_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P20_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P20_S1	The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P20_S2	Management has identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to (1) inappropriate logical access over the Company's primary general ledger system, (2) lack of controls in accounting for the Company's income tax provision and uncertain tax position liability, (3) lack of documentation around the Company's valuation of stock-based awards granted during the current year, (4) lack of regular account balance reconciliations at each balance sheet date, and (5) lack of oversight of company expenses charged to the corporate credit cards.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P20_S3	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. as of February 2, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended February 2, 2013.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P20_S4	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2013 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated April 30, 2013, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
844161_13_ITEM9A_P21_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Cherokee Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

844161_14_ITEM1_P3_S3	Additional information regarding this acquisition and our restated license agreement with Kohl's is described below under the heading "Brands" and elsewhere in this annual report.
844161_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	We own several trademarks, including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others.
844161_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	As of February 1, 2014, we had twenty-seven continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets.
844161_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners, companies, wholesalers and retailers in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores.
844161_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns us with our retailer licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our fiscal year ending February 1, 2014 was a 52 week fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P7_S3	In addition, certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods which may differ from ours.
844161_14_ITEM1_P7_S4	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year-to-year basis.
844161_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	As used herein the term "First Quarter" refers to the three months ended May 4, 2013; the term "Second Quarter" refers to the three months ended August 3, 2013; the term "Third Quarter" refers to the three months ended November 2, 2013; the term "Fourth Quarter" refers to the three months ended February 1, 2014; the term "Fiscal 2014" refers to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014; the term "Fiscal 2013" refers to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2013; and the term "Fiscal 2012" refers to the fiscal year ended January 28, 2012.
844161_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Cherokee brand, which began as a footwear brand in 1973, is an iconic American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual comfort at affordable prices.
844161_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	We acquired the Sideout brand, which offers an authentic, casual street and beach inspired "California Lifestyle", and related trademarks, in November 1997.
844161_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz and Chorus Line brands and trademarks were acquired by us in December 2002, and are recognized women's brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	In September 2012, we acquired the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, which are one of the most recognized and respected maternity brands sold throughout North America.
844161_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	We acquired additional rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in January 2013, which will expand our overall product offering.
844161_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	In January 2014, we acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands, to further expand into the department store and specialty channels of distribution globally.
844161_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our primary emphasis is domestic and international Direct to Retail licensing.
844161_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	As of February 1, 2014, we had twenty-seven continuing license or brand representation agreements covering both domestic and international markets, fourteen of which pertained to the Cherokee brand.
844161_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	By entering into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations and providing them the authority to manufacture and sell products with our brands coupled with our proprietary 360 degree turn-key solution for product development, marketing and support services, management believes stockholder value will be maximized.
844161_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use the trademarks on certain product categories of merchandise.
844161_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	We collaborate with our licensees' product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or expand the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	All products are subject to our pre-approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards, and all marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	In many cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise.
844161_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	We refer to this practice as our "Direct to Retail" or "DTR" licensing strategy.
844161_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Wholesale licensees manufacture and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	We plan to continue to solicit new licensees in new territories and additional product categories as we expand our business.
844161_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Over the past two decades, the Direct-to-Retail licensing strategy has become widely accepted by retailers worldwide as it generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Typically, this differentiation also provides the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a "premium" over private label price points resulting in increased profit margins, after royalties have been paid to Cherokee.
844161_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Our licensees directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating our exposure to inventory risk, while at the same time allowing our licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Many of the world's largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands within the DTR model in order to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over their peers within their respective markets.
844161_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Examples of retailers actively participating in, and benefiting from the DTR licensing model include Target, Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Tesco, Kohl's and C A, among others.
844161_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our Direct to Retail licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that for retailers in various countries worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, footwear and accessories business, from product development and design, to merchandising, to sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers, who not only command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with the end consumer.
844161_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We believe that these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by directly designing, sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than through carrying strictly private label goods or branded products from third-party vendors.
844161_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	We also expect that the enhanced profitability of our direct-to-retail strategy, coupled with the substantial marketing costs to establish and maintain an in-store brand, will continue to increase the desirability of our strategy to retailers.
844161_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our primary strategy is to capitalize on these trends around the world by licensing our portfolio of brand names directly to retailers, who, working in conjunction with us, develop merchandise for their stores, and to augment our current portfolio by acquiring additional brands which have high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a range of merchandise categories.
844161_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe that our core strengths position us to expand our business and enhance stockholder value through execution of our proprietary 360 degree strategy.
844161_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Our global strategic initiatives currently include:
844161_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Product Design Development Providing regular, on-going creative inspiration and direction for product design in key categories.
844161_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our vision and infrastructure are transforming so that we can further support our licensees through monthly and quarterly reports and market research, identifying and sharing approved global sourcing and manufacturing partners, and retail analytics.
844161_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	Marketing Services Evolve the brands' positioning, on a global scale, to maintain freshness and relevance for today's family and strengthening the brands' marketing platforms in collaboration with our retail partners on direct-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer basis through updated floor presentations and social and digital media initiatives.
844161_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	Strategic Sales Initiatives To generate additional revenue through the introduction of new product categories with our existing brands; the introduction of new licensees in new territories and through the acquisition of additional style-focused lifestyle brands where we can leverage our relationships and experience with current or new licensees identified through our global distribution platform.
844161_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	In addition, we plan to reflect our global brand vision by launching various on-line initiatives, including investing in social media and using it as a means to get and stay closer to our customer, creating a mobile phone strategy to increase engagement, interaction and promotion, investing in paid search engine optimization and Web analytics, and developing an on-going email campaign that builds awareness, rewards loyalty, and drives traffic.
844161_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We have three strategic platforms for future growth of our licensing business.
844161_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	New Brands acquire and represent new brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are targeting style focused lifestyle brands like our recently acquired Tony Hawk and Liz Lange brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Potential new brands must be able to have a global platform and product category expansion opportunities.
844161_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	Organic Growth new category introductions with existing partners.
844161_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	Organic growth drivers such as larger dotcom presence with our partners, enhanced in-store experience such as shop-in-shop floor presentations, category expansion into home, footwear, and essentials, and partner expansion with more stores.
844161_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	Geographic Expansion expansion of existing brands into new territories, such as our recent expansion of the Liz Lange brand into India with Mahindra.
844161_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Cherokee markets both owned brands and brands it represents.
844161_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	In addition to licensing our own brands, we assist other companies in identifying licensees for their brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	Generally, when representing brands, we perform a range of services including marketing of brands, solicitation of licensees, contract negotiations, and administration and maintenance of license or distribution agreements.
844161_14_ITEM1_P25_S3	In return for our services, we normally receive a certain percentage of the net royalties generated by the brands we represent and sign to a license agreement.
844161_14_ITEM1_P25_S4	We typically work on several select brand representation opportunities during each fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P25_S5	A summary of our owned brands and other brand representations is included below.
844161_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Today, our brands are licensed in over 50 countries and approaching 5,000 retail locations with blue-chip retail and wholesale licensees.
844161_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	We continue to solicit additional licensees for all our brands internationally.
844161_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	At February 1, 2014, we had fourteen ongoing licensing agreements for our owned Cherokee brand.
844161_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	These all represent Direct to Retail licensing agreements.
844161_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Licensing revenues from our Cherokee brand totaled $24.6 million for Fiscal 2014, which represented 86% of our total revenues.
844161_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Cherokee is an iconic, American family-lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual, comfortable products at affordable prices.
844161_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Cherokee was initially launched as a footwear line in 1973, timeless classics, inspired by vintage Americana while continually being updated to account for modern trends.

844161_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	This storied heritage perfectly positions the Cherokee brand for future growth and further international expansion.
844161_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Cherokee brand's most significant licensee is Target Corporation, who launched the Cherokee brand almost two decades ago as a multi-category product offering that encompasses kid's apparel, school uniforms, accessories and footwear.
844161_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	Internationally, additional categories of Cherokee branded products are sold including adult apparel, home d cor, textiles, outdoor furnishings and camping gear.

844161_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	In 2001, the inaugural Liz Lange Maternity store opened in New York City and a second store opened shortly thereafter in Beverly Hills to provide stylish, well-made maternity clothes.
844161_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Soon after that, many female celebrities and women embraced the Liz Lange brand as they chose to celebrate the "bump" and look stylish and fashionable while pregnant.
844161_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	In 2002, Liz Lange maternity debuted in over 1,500 Target stores in the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	During 2010, Completely Me by Liz Lange was launched exclusively on the Home Shopping Network in the United States and The Shopping Channel in Canada.
844161_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Completely Me brand consists of sophisticated and comfortable casual clothing and sportswear.

844161_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	The brand was, and will continue to be, exclusively licensed in the United States to Kohl's Corporation with Tony Hawk clothing and accessories sold in Kohl's Department Stores and online.
844161_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	Separate wholesale license agreements are in place to supply Hawk and Tony Hawk Signature apparel in Canada and the company intends to secure additional licensees to expand the brand globally.
844161_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	Conceived in 1983 by a California volleyball player, our owned Sideout brand took root at the beach, harnessing the easy spirit of California casual.

844161_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	We are representing the le by alessandra brand, which debuted at Planet Blue in March 2014.
844161_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our rights to receive royalties for sales of products bearing our brands are set forth in the terms of our license agreements.
844161_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Generally, royalty rates for our DTR licenses vary as a percentage of the retailer's net sales of licensed products and in some cases are calculated based upon fixed percentages of product sales.
844161_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	In other cases, the royalty rates we receive may decrease depending on the retailer's annual sales of licensed products and the retailer's guaranteed annual sales of licensed products and do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our arrangement with Target provides in significant part for royalty rate reductions once certain specified cumulative levels of sales for Cherokee branded products in various specified product categories are achieved by Target during each fiscal year and, in other cases, for fixed royalty rates that apply irrespective of sales volume, including sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada, Cherokee adult products sold on Target dotcom and for sales of Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category.
844161_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary in each licensing agreement.
844161_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	In order to ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license contracts include our right to audit our licensees' retail sales data for our brands to allow us to validate the royalties paid.
844161_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	We also provide exclusive rights to our licensees to particular countries and product categories.
844161_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	In most cases, we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum dollar amount of retail sales.
844161_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	These minimum guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P44_S3	In the case of Target, its minimum royalty was $10.5 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	As of February 1, 2014, we had contractual rights to receive over $85 million forward-facing minimum royalty revenue guarantees, excluding any renewals.
844161_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our rights to such contractual minimums are primarily the result of our recent extension of our restated license agreement with Target through January 2017 and our agreement with Kohl's for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands through January 2018.
844161_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period that has been defined in the underlying license agreement.
844161_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	During Fiscal 2014, we received a total of $19.6 million in aggregate royalties from our U.S. Direct to Retail license agreements and brand representation contracts, which accounted for 68% of our consolidated revenues during such period.
844161_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	During Fiscal 2014, we received $9.0 million in aggregate royalties from our international license agreements, which accounted for 32% of our consolidated revenues during such period.
844161_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Two of our most significant Direct to Retail licensees are Target Corporation ("Target") and Kohl's Corporation ("Kohl's").
844161_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Pursuant to our restated license agreement with Target, Target maintains the exclusive right to the Cherokee brand in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S. and, starting in February 2013, in Canada.
844161_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Our U.S. license with Target, excluding sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada, Cherokee adult products sold on Target dotcom and for sales of Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, provides for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	The current term of the Target agreement continues through January 31, 2017.
844161_14_ITEM1_P48_S4	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to Target's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our agreement with Target was amended as of January 31, 2013 to include a multi-year license in the category of school uniforms following our re-acquisition of such rights from a third party.
844161_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	As part of such amendment, Target agreed to pay Cherokee a fixed annual royalty rate for its sales of Cherokee-branded children's school uniforms products in the United States based on Target's net sales of such products.
844161_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our restated license agreement with Target was further amended in April 2013 to provide for a fixed royalty rate for sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category made through Target's website (target.com).
844161_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	Our agreement with Target was most recently amended as of January 2, 2014 to renew and extend its term through January 31, 2017.
844161_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	In addition, Target now has the right to renew the Target license agreement for successive two year periods, provided that it satisfied the minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $10.5 million for the preceding fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	For sales of Cherokee branded merchandise that are sold in the U.S., other than in the category of school uniforms and other than sales made through Target dotcom website in the category of adult merchandise, Target is obligated to pay royalties to Cherokee based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in the U.S. during each fiscal year ended January 31st, which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise in any fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	For Target's sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in Canada, and for sales of Cherokee products in the category of school uniforms and sales made through Target's website in the category of adult merchandise, Target is obligated to pay us a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal quarter.
844161_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	In connection with our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands from Quiksilver in January 2014, Cherokee entered into an amended retail license agreement with Kohl's Department Stores.
844161_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	Pursuant to our restated license agreement with Kohl's, Kohl's maintains the exclusive right to the Hawk and Tony Hawk Signature apparel brands in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S.
844161_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	Our license with Kohl's provides for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	The current term of the Kohl's agreement continues through January 31, 2018, and Kohl's has agreed to pay Cherokee an annual minimum royalty of $4.8 million.
844161_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to Kohl's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	During September 2012, we assumed an additional license agreement with Target for the U.S. covering the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	Pursuant to such agreement, Target is obligated to pay us a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of products bearing such brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Royalty revenues from Target U.S. for the Cherokee brand were $15.3 million during Fiscal 2014, $15.0 million during Fiscal 2013 and $13.8 million during Fiscal 2012, which accounted for 53%, 57%, and 54%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	The termination of our restated license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand would have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	We have continuing international license agreements for the Cherokee brand with leading retailers in over fifty countries.
844161_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	We license to retailers such as Tesco, RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, and Nishimatsuya.
844161_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	We entered into a Direct to Retail licensing agreement for the Cherokee brand with Great Britain's Tesco Stores Limited ("Tesco"), pursuant to which Tesco has exclusive rights to a wide range of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United Kingdom and certain other countries in Europe and is obligated to pay us a royalty based upon a percentage of its net sales of Cherokee branded products in those countries.
844161_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	The increase in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products over the previous fiscal year was due to Tesco's re-launch of the Cherokee brand in March 2013.
844161_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	We hold various trademarks including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in a number of other countries.
844161_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	We also hold trademark applications for Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout and Sideout Sport, Carole Little, Saint Tropez-West, Chorus Line and All That Jazz in numerous countries.
844161_14_ITEM1_P57_S3	We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of our trademarks, and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Royalties paid to us pursuant to our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of the licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Carole Little and other brands are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign brands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66.
844161_14_ITEM1_P59_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and the greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of directly sourced merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Therefore, our success is dependent on our licensees' ability to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Companies such as Iconix Brand Group, Phillips-Van Heusen, Perry Ellis International, VF Corp. and other companies owning established trademarks have entered into similar arrangements with retailers.
844161_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	As of February 1, 2014, we employed thirty-nine persons based solely in the United States.

844161_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Mr. Siegel has been employed by us since January 1996 as Vice President of Operations and Administration and became President on June 1, 1998.
844161_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Prior to January 1996, Mr. Siegel had a long tenure in the apparel business industry working as a senior executive for both Federated Department stores and Carter Hawley Hale Broadway stores.
844161_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Mr. Boling became our Chief Financial Officer in March 2013.

844161_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" for additional risks and uncertainties applicable to us.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The risks described below and elsewhere in this Report are not the only ones we face.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, together with merchandise bearing our recently acquired "Liz Lange," "Completely Me by Liz Lange," "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona, and Route 66.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de-emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, in the United States our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands, and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of our brands as our license agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing from our competitors.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers, including our existing retail partners, competing for limited floor pad and rack space.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There are numerous risk factors that apply to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees) that can affect their level of sales of products that bear our brands.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Any decline in sales by our licensees can adversely affect our revenues.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Factors that may adversely affect our licensees and their sales of products bearing our brands include the following: (i) weather; (ii) changes in the availability or cost of capital; (iii) shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; (iv) declining retail prices; (v) labor strikes or other interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors; (vi) the impact of excess retail capacity; (vii) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (viii) material acquisitions or dispositions; (ix) investments in new business strategies; (x) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xi) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; and (xii) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We rely on the accuracy of our licensees' retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Most of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands for manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands in their stores.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Under our existing agreements, these licensees pay us licensing fees based in part on the retail value of products sold.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We rely on our licensees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections, budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	All of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If any of our licensee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our business is largely dependent on royalties from Target.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target accounted for greater than 50% of our consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products under the Restated Target Agreement while continuing to pay the minimum royalties of $10.5 million per fiscal year required under such agreement.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Replacing the royalty payments received from Target would be a significant challenge and no assurances can be made that we would be successful in doing so.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The termination of this license agreement would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The current term of the Restated Target Agreement continues through January 31, 2017.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	In addition, in September 2012 we expanded our relationship with Target as a result of our assumption of an additional license agreement with Target for the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of assets related to such brands.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We further expanded our relationship with Target in connection with our January 2013 acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	We acquired the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands as well as our rights to the Cherokee brand for the school uniforms category in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for such brands and the school uniforms category will grow in future periods, although we can provide no assurances that such revenue growth will occur.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	As a result of our reliance on Target, our continued success is dependent on various factors affecting Target's business, including, for example, perceptions of Target by consumers in the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	We believe that sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the United States during the Fourth Quarter were adversely impacted following Target's announcement of unauthorized access to payment card data in U.S. stores.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Revenues from our "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" brands depend entirely on Kohl's.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In January 2014, we acquired the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" brands from Quiksilver.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Concurrently with this acquisition, we entered into an amended retail license agreement with Kohl's Department Stores.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, Kohl's is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States, which we agreed to in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Kohl's for such brands will grow in future periods, although we can provide no assurances that such revenue growth will occur beyond the contractual minimum royalties guaranteed through the restated license agreement.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The failure of our licensees to sell products bearing our brands or to pay us royalties for such products could result in a decline in our results of operations.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our licensing agreements.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although the licensing agreements for our brands in most cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees to satisfy their obligations under these agreements or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Further, while we are substantially dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl's, the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees to meet their financial obligations to us could materially and adversely impact our results of operation and our financial condition.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on the levels of consumer spending which may affect our licensees' sales.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Consumer spending is showing signs of stabilization and in some cases improvement; however it is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Purchases of apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain, or increase our revenues.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition to other consequences, these periods may be accompanied by decreased consumer spending generally, as well as decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with our international licensees.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We market and license our brands outside the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Many of our licensees are located outside the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	During Fiscal 2014, greater than 30% of our revenues were derived internationally.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers; (iii) difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to manage foreign licensees; competition from foreign companies; (iv) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (v) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property; (vi) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (vii) fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and the cost of currency exchange; (viii) potentially adverse tax consequences; and (ix) cultural differences in the conduct of business.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Additionally, and because our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively impact our royalty revenues.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, and the Chinese Yuan.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights or that we will not become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We hold various trademarks for our brands including Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout and Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other countries.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We also hold several trademark applications for these brands in approximately 100 countries.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may become involved in other litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may not successfully address problems encountered in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from them.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We recently consummated three acquisitions: our acquisition of the Liz Lange brands in September 2012; our acquisition of various rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in January 2013; and our acquisition of the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" signature apparel brands in January 2014.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands, or to engage in other strategic transactions, that could enhance our portfolio of products and services, or expand the breadth of our markets.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our history of acquiring and integrating acquisitions is limited, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio, which could pose substantial challenges for management.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Acquisitions and other strategic transactions can involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including, among others: (i) problems assimilating the brands; (ii) significant future charges relating the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) problems maintaining and enforcing standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems; (iv) difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses; (v) unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, including accounting and legal charges, capital expenditures, and transaction expenses; (vi) diversion of management's attention from our core business or our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with our partners; and (viii) risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transaction that we pursue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In addition, future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we finance future acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If we finance future acquisitions by issuing debt we may become over-levered and restrict our ability to operate the Company.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill or trademarks, any of which could harm our operating results or financial condition.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our level of indebtedness, and covenant restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In order to fund our acquisition of the Liz Lange brands, we entered into a credit facility with JP Morgan Chase on September 4, 2012.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We initially increased the size of our credit facility on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We further increased the size of our credit facility on January 10, 2014 in connection with our acquisition of various assets related to the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" signature apparel brands.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The size of our credit facility totals $37.6 million, of which approximately $32 million was outstanding as of February 1, 2014, and is evidenced by (i) two 5-year term notes, which were issued on January 31, 2013 and January 10, 2014 in the principal amounts of $16.6 million and $19 million, respectively, and (ii) a 3-year revolving line of credit, pursuant to which we may borrow up to $2 million in principal.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our indebtedness under the credit agreement could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things: making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development and capital expenditures and other business activities; making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In addition, the terms of our indebtedness contain various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain JP Morgan's consent before we can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) consummate acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans or programs, or (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our credit agreement also imposes financial covenants, including: (i) a minimum "fixed charge coverage ratio" of at least 1.2 to 1.0 and (ii) a limitation of our "senior funded debt ratio" not exceed a ratio equal to (i) 2.50 to 1.00 through our fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2014, (ii) 2.25 to 1.00 from our fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2015 through our fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016, and (iii) 2.00 to 1.00 thereafter.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Further, as collateral for the credit agreement, we granted a security interest in favor of JP Morgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiaries.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In the event of a default under the credit agreement, JPMorgan Chase has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit agreement, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit agreement and exercise its other rights including foreclosing on our assets under the security agreements.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in a material adverse effect to our business, including our financial condition and our liquidity.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, particularly given the continuing credit crisis and downturn in the overall global economy.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	This may materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of applicable Cherokee-branded products and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on such initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long term, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so or that such initiatives will result in the intended benefits.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Although we paid dividends during each quarter from December 2003 until the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, our Board of Directors may reduce or discontinue dividends at any time for any reason it deems relevant and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends, or that we will continue to pay dividends with the cash that we do generate.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The determination regarding the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and there can be no assurances that we will continue to generate sufficient cash to pay dividends, or that we will pay dividends in future periods.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, pursuant to our Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase, we are prohibited from paying dividends in the event that we would be in violation of our covenant regarding our "fixed charge coverage ratio" after giving effect to any proposed dividend or are otherwise then in default of such agreement.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or by our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, our existing license agreements, our existing brand representations, new license agreements, new brand representations or strategic alliances or other agreements, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Further, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Subject to the approval of JPMorgan Chase pursuant to our credit agreement, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, (ii) such shares of preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted following the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our effective income tax rates could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	We may come under audit by tax authorities.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S5	For instance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is examining our 2012 corporate tax returns, and the State of California is examining our 2009 and 2010 corporate tax returns.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S7	Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P52_S8	In addition, changes in tax rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if repeated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	As disclosed in Item 9A, management previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of February 2, 2013 and as of the end of each of the First Quarter, the Second Quarter and the Third Quarter based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	During Fiscal 2014, we developed and implemented a remediation plan that was designed to address these material weaknesses.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	While we believe our remedial measures are sufficient to address the material weaknesses as of February 1, 2014, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	In addition, even though we believe we have strengthened our controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards, we may be unable to conclude in future periods that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and financial condition could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, or the market price of our stock could decline significantly.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P55_S5	Moreover, our reputation with lenders, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Compliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards will increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Furthermore, with such uncertainties and following our previous identification of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, which we believe has been remediated as of February 1, 2014, it is possible in future periods that our system of internal control will fail to be effective or satisfactory to our independent registered public accounting firm.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In this case, our financial reporting may not be timely and/or accurate and we may be issued an adverse or qualified opinion by our independent registered public accounting firm.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P57_S4	If reporting delays or errors actually occur, we could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could adversely affect our financial results or result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the requirement that we must file our financial statements with the SEC using the interactive data format eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), and the possibility that we would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
844161_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In order to comply with XBRL and IFRS requirements, we may have to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies which could significantly increase our costs.
844161_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.
844161_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease a 10,104 square foot office facility in Sherman Oaks, California, which we recently expanded by an additional 1,295 square feet pursuant to an amendment to our lease agreement.
844161_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	Our current lease term ends on November 1, 2016, and we have one five-year option to renew, for which we would have to give written notice no later than nine months prior to the date that the option period would commence.
844161_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our monthly base rent is currently $21,975 and is subject to increase to $25,083 once our expansion space is substantially complete, which we expect to occur during the first quarter of Fiscal 2015.
844161_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also lease a 1,968 square foot office facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
844161_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	Our current lease term for this facility ends on March 15, 2018, and we have one three-year option to renew, for which we would have to give written notice no less than twelve months prior to the expiration of the term.
844161_14_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our current monthly base rent for this facility is $2,050.
844161_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Both agreements have provisions allowing for early termination under certain conditions.
844161_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease an office facility in Huntington Beach, California.
844161_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our current lease term for this facility ends on June 30, 2014.
844161_14_ITEM2_P1_S3	Our current monthly base rent for this facility is $5,000.
844161_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
844161_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that could harm our business.
844161_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we or our wholly owned subsidiaries are a party that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
844161_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol "CHKE".
844161_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth for each of the fiscal quarters during our last two fiscal years the range of the high and low sale prices for our common stock and the cash dividends declared and paid per share, if any.
844161_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	On April 11, 2014, the latest sale price for our common stock, reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market System, was $13.50 per share.
844161_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of April 11, 2014, the approximate number of stockholders of record of our common stock was 81.
844161_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	This figure does not include beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.
844161_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements, compliance with our credit agreement and other factors deemed relevant by Cherokee's Board of Directors.
844161_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly-traded licensing companies exists; hence, we compared the return on investment in our stock to the S P 100-LTD and NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX.
844161_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing January 31, 2009 and ending on February 1, 2014.
844161_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	The data set forth below assumes the value of an investment in our common stock and each Index was $100 on January 31, 2009.
844161_14_ITEM5_P6_S2	The data set forth below also assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.
844161_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	The stock performance shown on the graph below should not be considered indicative of future price performance.
844161_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	During Fiscal 2014, we did not sell or offer to sell any securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
844161_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected consolidated financial information has been taken or derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of our results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. See "Item 8.
844161_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, other filings we may make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as press releases and other written or oral statements we may make may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
844161_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	When used, the words "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "objectives", "goals", "aims", "hopes", "may", "likely", "should" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.
844161_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	In particular, the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K include, among others, statements regarding our goals or expectations regarding our future revenues and earnings, the likelihood of increased retail sales by our current and future licensees, such as Target, the likelihood that our licensees will achieve royalty rate reductions, our prospects for obtaining new licensees and our prospects for obtaining new brands to acquire or represent.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, achievements or share price to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or share price expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of the apparel industry and the retail industry, the overall level of consumer spending and our exposure to general economic conditions, the effect of intense competition we face from other apparel lines both within and outside of Target, adverse changes in licensee or consumer acceptance of products bearing the Cherokee brand or our other brands as a result of fashion trends or otherwise, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the ability and/or commitment of our licensees to design, manufacture and market Cherokee or our other branded products, our dependence on Target for a substantial portion of our revenues, risks associated with our international licensees, our dependence on our key management personnel, the success of our strategic and marketing initiatives, the benefits to us of our recently acquired assets related to the "Hawk", "Tony Hawk", "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, the possibility that we may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses or present significant distractions to our management, any adverse determination of intellectual property or other claims, liabilities or litigation, our indebtedness and other requirements under our credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, our future capital needs and our ability to raise funds in future periods if necessary, our ability to issue preferred stock with rights and privileges that are superior to those of our common stock, our payment or non-payment of dividends in future periods, the volatility in the trading price and the relative illiquidity of our common stock, unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, and our compliance with changing laws and financial standards.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Several of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail under "Item 1A. Business Risk Factors" as well as in the discussion and analysis below.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	You should however, understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties and you should not consider the risks and uncertainties identified by us to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties that could materially affect us.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements we make herein because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S5	We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events and developments.
844161_14_ITEM7_P1_S6	Certain of the information set forth herein are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" as that term is defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the presentation of our selling, general and administrative expenses exclusive of certain extraordinary professional, consulting and related fees incurred in connection with the completion of the Fiscal 2013 year-end audit and related procedures and inclusive of certain professional, consulting and related fees incurred in connection with our acquisition of the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" brands in January 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance of the Company's business and the Company's cash flow, excluding extraordinary items that Cherokee does not expect to recur in future periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
844161_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and information reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP are also included in the discussion below.
844161_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
844161_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Since May 1995, we have principally been in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee brand and related trademarks and other brands we own or represent.
844161_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Our operating strategy emphasizes domestic and international Direct to Retail and wholesale licensing, whereby we grant retailers and wholesalers the license to use our trademarks for certain categories of merchandise.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our Cherokee brand is an iconic American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual comfort at affordable prices.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	We own several trademarks, including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners, companies, wholesalers and retailers in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	We derive revenues from licensing our trademarks to retailers all over the world.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	We license to retailers such as Target, Kohl's, Tesco, RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, and Nishimatsuya.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S6	In September 2012, we acquired the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, which are among the most recognized and respected maternity brands sold throughout North America.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S7	We acquired additional rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in January 2013, which expanded our overall product offering.
844161_14_ITEM7_P5_S8	In January 2014, we acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands, to further expand into the department store and specialty channels of distribution globally.
844161_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	In certain select cases, including Target and Kohl's, we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee's retail sales since the beginning of the year.
844161_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	For example, the amount of royalty revenue earned by us from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target's cumulative level of retail sales for Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees' retail sales are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease as certain retail sales thresholds are met.
844161_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	Historically, with Target, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the execution of new license agreements and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter from Target and also on the revenues we receive from Target or other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, including with respect to our recently acquired Liz Lange and the Completely Me by Liz Lange brands as well as our recent re-acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	On April 3, 2013, we amended our license agreement with Target to provide for a fixed royalty rate of 2% for sales of Cherokee-branded products in the category of adult merchandise that are made on Target's website (target.com) during fiscal years subsequent to Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our agreement with Target was most recently amended as of January 2, 2014 to renew the Target License Agreement through January 31, 2017.
844161_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Under the most recent Target amendment, Target now has the right to renew the Target license agreement for successive two year periods, provided that it satisfied the minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $10.5 million for the preceding fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We also provide exclusive rights to our licensees to particular countries and product categories.
844161_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	In most cases we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum dollar amount of retail sales.
844161_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	These minimum guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	In the case of Target, its minimum royalty was $10.5 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	As of February 1, 2014, we had contractual rights to receive $85 million forward-facing minimum royalty revenue guarantees, excluding any renewals.
844161_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our rights to such contractual minimums are primarily the result of our recent extension of our restated license agreement with Target through January 2017 and our agreement with Kohl's for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands through January 2018.
844161_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	However, our licensees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period-to-period fluctuations in retail sales of our branded products by our licensees in the specific territories in which they operate.
844161_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	As a result, and except as noted elsewhere in Cherokee's comparisons of its three most recently completed fiscal years, Cherokee does not have sufficient information required to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or product mix by our licensees.
844161_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Fluctuations in retail sales of Cherokee branded products or other product brands that we own or represent may be the result of a variety of factors, including, without limitation: (i) changes in the number of product categories for which a licensee chooses to use our brands from period-to-period, which generally results in changes in the amount of inventory (utilizing our brands) available for sale from period-to-period; (ii) the number of geographical markets/territories or number of stores in which our licensees are currently selling Cherokee or our other branded products from period-to-period; or (iii) our licensees experiencing changes in retail sales levels as a result of a variety of factors, including fashion-related and general retail sales trends.
844161_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	(See Item 1A. Business "Risk Factors").
844161_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our disclosure related to the sales of our international licensees through this Annual Report on Form 10-K is denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
844161_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	In arriving at such denominations, Cherokee receives a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our licensees which are denominated in the applicable foreign currency.
844161_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	These amounts are then converted by us to U.S. dollars using the appropriate exchange rate for the purpose of the disclosure of the retail sales denominated in U.S. dollars.
844161_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	In all periods presented in this report, Cherokee does not consider the period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on accuracy of the U.S. dollar- denominated figures presented in this Form 10-K.
844161_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	On September 4, 2012, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with LLM Management Co., LLC, pursuant to which we acquired various assets related to the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands.
844161_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	As consideration for the acquisition, we paid an initial cash purchase price equal to $13.1 million, with $12.6 million paid by us concurrently with the closing and $0.5 million of which was placed in an escrow fund that was released on March 31, 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	In addition, we paid an additional $0.9 million in contingent consideration, consisting of an earn-out payment of $0.4 million that we paid to the seller in March 2013 and an additional earn-out payment of $0.5 million that we paid to the seller in March 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	The aggregate of $0.9 million in earn-out consideration was payable upon satisfaction of certain revenues attributable to the assets during Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014, as applicable.
844161_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	In addition, as part of the acquisition, we agreed to assume the seller's obligations under various agreements, which included a consulting agreement with Ms. Lange as well as certain existing license agreements relating to the assets.
844161_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	On January 31, 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired various rights relating to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in exchange for a cash payment of $4.25 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Cherokee previously sold such rights to the seller in July 1995.
844161_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	In connection with this acquisition, we entered into a multi-year amendment to our license agreement with Target to include the category of school uniforms.
844161_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Pursuant to such amendment, Target agreed to pay Cherokee an annual royalty rate for its sales of Cherokee-branded children's school uniforms products in the United States fixed at 2% of Target's net sales of such products and subject to a minimum annual royalty of $0.8 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	On January 10, 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Quiksilver, Inc. and Hawk Designs, Inc., to which we acquired various assets related to the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" signature apparel brands and related trademarks.
844161_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	As consideration for the acquisition, Cherokee paid a cash purchase price equal to $19 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	In connection with this acquisition, Cherokee entered into an amended retail license agreement with Kohl's Department Stores.
844161_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Pursuant to this agreement, Kohl's is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States and has agreed to pay Cherokee an annual minimum royalty of $4.8 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	On September 4, 2012, and in connection with our acquisition of the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase, which was amended on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category, and further amended on January 10, 2014 in connection with our acquisition of various assets related to the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" signature apparel brands.
844161_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Pursuant to the credit agreement, as amended, JPMorgan Chase has issued to Cherokee two term notes, consisting of an amended term note issued on January 31, 2013 in the principal amount of $16.6 million and a new term note issued on January 10, 2014 in the principal amount of $19 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Additional information regarding the credit agreement is included in our discussion of our liquidity below.
844161_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
844161_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, deferred taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation.
844161_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates.
844161_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	Revenues are not recognized unless collectability is reasonably assured.
844161_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Royalty agreements that account for the majority of our historical revenues are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees.
844161_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as required sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year, and as a consequence such royalty rate reductions do not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	We are responsible for the licensing and enforcement of intellectual property and to pursue third parties that are utilizing our assets without a license or who have under-reported the amount of royalties owed under a license agreement with us.
844161_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	As a result of these activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P20_S2	These royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P20_S3	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently audited or reported as an adjustment to those amounts due from licensees, will be recognized as appropriate.
844161_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
844161_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_14_ITEM7_P21_S2	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_14_ITEM7_P21_S3	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy, because when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	Tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance, which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.
844161_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	We consider this to be critical accounting policy because if those estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for such assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	To date there has been no impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets for continuing operations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with authoritative guidance and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	We account for equity awards in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors for employee stock options based on estimated fair values.
844161_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The fair value of stock options are estimated using option valuation models.
844161_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	These models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the graded amortization method.
844161_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statement of operations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if any of the estimates above require significant changes, these changes could result in fluctuating expenses that could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, was $1.1 million, $1.0 million and $0.6 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of our consolidated financial data.
844161_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	In Fiscal 2014, our revenues totaled $28.6 million, as compared to $26.6 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and to a lesser extent wholesalers and our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	The increase in revenues of $2.0 million is primarily from Liz Lange, Target Canada, Uniforms, Tony Hawk and other international licensees of $4.0 million partially offset by $2.0 million in decreased revenues from Zellers.
844161_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $397.1 million and $411.0 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	For Fiscal 2014, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.4 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	As the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent periods, we believe the cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2014 in comparison to the comparable prior year periods was an approximate $0.5 million decrease for Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues by brand for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Target currently has approximately 1,797 stores in the United States.
844161_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the U.S. were slightly higher in Fiscal 2014 at approximately $1.1 billion.
844161_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Target.
844161_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	The license is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products during each fiscal year with respect to Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S.
844161_14_ITEM7_P36_S4	We have amended our agreement with Target to provide for fixed royalty rates for Target's retail sales in Canada, for sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made by Target through its website (target.com) and for sales by Target of Cherokee branded products in the category of school uniforms.
844161_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	In addition, in September 2012 we assumed a separate multi-year license agreement with Target in connection with our acquisition of the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, pursuant to which Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of its products bearing such brands in the U.S.
844161_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	In Fiscal 2014, Target reached the guaranteed minimum yearly royalty amount of $10.5 million in the three month period ended November 2, 2013 (the "Third Quarter").
844161_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Commencing with Fiscal 2014, the minimum annual royalty amount applicable to our restated license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand is $10.5 million, which applies to all sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. and Canada other than school uniforms, which are subject to a separate minimum annual royalty of $0.8 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	Based upon our new strategic initiatives and after consideration of our recent expansion of our relationship with Target to include the category of school uniforms and the territory of Canada for the Cherokee brand and following our assumption of a separate agreement with Target covering our Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, we believe that our future revenues from Target may increase as compared to those reported in Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Because we do not have direct oversight over Target, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given future period.
844161_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	We are currently providing suggested guidance to Target in the marketing and sales of Cherokee branded products and expect this will continue in future periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved for Cherokee branded products in various categories in the U.S., we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and fourth quarter to be our lowest quarter.
844161_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $15.3 million in Fiscal 2014 and $15.0 million in Fiscal 2013, which accounted for 53%, and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2014 were $13.3 million and during Fiscal 2013 were $11.5 million, which accounted for 47% and 43%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	Target's U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the Fourth Quarter totaled $317.2 million compared to $344.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, decreasing approximately 7.9%.
844161_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $2.4 million for the Fourth Quarter and $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, decreasing approximately 15%.
844161_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	We attribute the decrease in retail sales in the Fourth Quarter at Target largely due to the effects of Target's security breach, which occurred during the holidays and is believed to have deterred certain consumers from shopping at Target.
844161_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Overall, Target's U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during Fiscal 2014 were slightly higher than Fiscal 2013 and as a result, our royalty revenues from Target for Fiscal 2014 were higher than the royalty revenues reported in Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were $0 during the Fourth Quarter compared to $16.0 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	For Fiscal 2014, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in Canada totaled $3.0 million, as compared to $101.6 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	The decrease in Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded products is attributed to store closings.
844161_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Revenues from Zellers totaled $0.1 million for Fiscal 2014 and $2.1 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	Beginning in February 2013, the selling of Cherokee branded products in Canada has transitioned from Zellers to Target due to Zellers store closing.
844161_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2014 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $4.4 million in the Fourth Quarter, as compared to $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	For Fiscal 2014, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $20.2 million, as compared to $15.5 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	We believe the increase in Tesco's retail sales is due to Tesco's re-launch of the Cherokee brand in March 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.2 million for the Fourth Quarter and $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.8 million for Fiscal 2014 and $0.7 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2014 increased to $7.4 million from $6.1 million in Fiscal 2013, representing a 21% increase.
844161_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	This total includes licensees for Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India, and other territories.
844161_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	All of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail information regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	* Included in Fiscal 2014 are approximately $1.0 million of expenses related to professional services for the acquisition of Hawk and Tony Hawk and approximately $1.0 million of professional and consulting fees that we believe will not recur and are related to the identification and remediation of weaknesses in internal control identified in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, including amortization of trademarks, were $18.6 million for Fiscal 2014, compared to $15.5 million for Fiscal 2013, representing an increase of $3.1 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Included in Fiscal 2014 are approximately $1.0 million of expenses related to professional services for the acquisition of Hawk and Tony Hawk, which we believe will not recur, and approximately $1.0 million of professional and consulting fees that we believe will not recur and are related to the identification and remediation of weaknesses in internal control identified in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for Fiscal 2013 (our "Fiscal 2013 Annual Report").
844161_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	These fees included audit fees, legal fees and consulting fees to evaluate our control systems and procedures, perform Sarbanes-Oxley related testing and compliance work, and provide additional analysis around tax provision, expense oversight and reconciliation analysis.
844161_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	These increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing and travel expenses.
844161_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	Excluding this approximately $1.8 million in expenses, which we do not expect to recur, our SG A expenses for Fiscal 2014 would have been $16.8 million, representing an increase of $1.3 million over the comparable period of last year.
844161_14_ITEM7_P50_S5	This $1.3 million increase was primarily related to personnel costs required to further maximize the 360 degree licensing model as we added to our infrastructure in anticipation of further growth in Fiscal 2015, including the launch of Cherokee branded adult products at Target dotcom and the expansion of our brand portfolio into new territories, partially offset by decreases in marketing and travel expenses.
844161_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2014 was $0.02 million, as compared to $0.02 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2014 was $0.5 million compared to $0.2 million for Fiscal 2013 due to the full year of interest expense for the debt associated with the acquisition of the Liz Lange and Cherokee Uniform brands.
844161_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	For Fiscal 2014, we recorded a tax provision of $3.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Our effective tax rate was 36% for Fiscal 2014 and 37% for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2014 was $6.1 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $6.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	We attribute these reductions in net income and earnings per share primarily to expenses we incurred for professional services in connection with our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands, to professional and consulting fees we incurred in connection with the identification and remediation of weaknesses highlighted in our Fiscal 2013 Annual Report, and to personnel costs required to further maximize the 360 degree licensing model.
844161_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	In Fiscal 2013, our revenues totaled $26.6 million, as compared to $25.6 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and to a lesser extent wholesalers and our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	The increase in revenues of $1.0 million is primarily from increases of retail sales at Target including Liz Lange and other international licensees of $4.0 million, which were partially offset by $3.0 million of decreases in revenues from Tesco and of our representation of the Norma Kamali brand.
844161_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $411.0 million and $423.7 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	For Fiscal 2013, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.3 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues for Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target increased in Fiscal 2013 by 17% to $1.1 billion from the $925.4 million reported in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	The increase in retail sales is attributable to increased demand for, and sales of, Cherokee- branded products in the U.S. as well as an increase in product categories.
844161_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	In Fiscal 2013, Target reached the guaranteed minimum yearly royalty amount of $9.0 million in the three month period ended October 27, 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $15.0 million in Fiscal 2013 and $13.8 million in Fiscal 2012, which accounted for 57%, and 54%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2013 were $11.5 million and during Fiscal 2012 were $11.8 million, which accounted for 43% and 46%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	We attribute this decline in revenues generated from licensing agreements other than our agreement with Target primarily to the declines in sales reported by Tesco, which began in fiscal 2010 and continued through Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013 totaled $344.5 million compared to $342.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, increasing approximately 1%.
844161_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target were $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013 and $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012, decreasing approximately 21%.
844161_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The decrease from Fiscal 2012 was primarily due to Target reaching the volume threshold for reduced royalty rates in the third quarter of Fiscal 2013 versus in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	Overall, Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products during Fiscal 2013 were higher than Fiscal 2012 and as a result, our royalty revenues from Target for Fiscal 2013 were higher than the royalty revenues reported in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following table sets forth our international licensing revenues.
844161_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2013 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, as compared to $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	For Fiscal 2013, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $15.5 million, as compared to $152.7 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	We believe the decrease in Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded products is primarily due to a reduction of Cherokee branded product categories in the UK and Central European countries, Tesco's commitment to bolster its private label brand within the children's product categories and the reduction of Cherokee branded products in the men's and women's categories, as well as challenging international economic conditions.
844161_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013 and $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.7 million for Fiscal 2013 and $2.8 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were approximately $16.0 million during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013 compared to $29.9 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	For Fiscal 2013, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $101.6 million, as compared to $104.8 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The decrease in Zellers' retail sales of the Cherokee branded products is attributed to store closings.
844161_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	Revenues from Zellers totaled $2.1 million in each of Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	Beginning in February 2013, the selling of Cherokee branded products in Canada has transitioned from Zellers to Target.
844161_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2013 increased to $6.7 million from $4.7 million in Fiscal 2012, representing a 41% gain.
844161_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	This total includes licensees for Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India, Spain and other territories.
844161_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	All of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses including amortization of trademarks for Fiscal 2013 were $15.5 million, or 58% of revenues, compared to $14.9 million, or 58% of revenues for Fiscal 2012, representing an increase of $0.6 million, but a consistent margin.
844161_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Included in Fiscal 2013 are $0.4 million of expenses related to professional services for evaluating acquisitions, $0.6 million in product development costs, relating to the re-launch of the Cherokee brand at Tesco and future licensees, and a $0.4 million increase in stock based compensation.
844161_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing related costs of $1.2 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2013 was $0.02 million, as compared to $0.03 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2013 was $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	For Fiscal 2013, we recorded a tax provision of $4.0 million, compared to $2.9 million for Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our effective tax rate was 37% for Fiscal 2013 and 28% for Fiscal 2012; the majority of the difference in our effective tax rates is due to our tax refund from the California Franchise Tax Board in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2013 was $6.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $7.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	We attribute these reductions in net income and earnings per share primarily to our tax refund from the California Franchise Tax Board in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	On February 1, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	On February 2, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	On January 28, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	During Fiscal 2014, cash provided by operations was $8.6 million, compared to $9.8 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	We attribute this decrease of $1.2 million in part to a decrease of $0.8 million in net income.
844161_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 include: (i) an increase in accounts payable of $0.6 million in Fiscal 2014 as compared to an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million in Fiscal 2013, which we attribute primarily to acquisition related expenses; (ii) an increase in accounts receivable of $0.9 million in Fiscal 2014 as compared to a decrease of $0.2 million in Fiscal 2013, which we attribute primarily to royalty revenue due for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands; and (iii) stock based compensation expense, including a tax effect, of $0.8 million in Fiscal 2014 as compared to $1.0 million in Fiscal 2013, which we attribute primarily to a tax shortfall from stock-based compensation in Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	During Fiscal 2013, cash provided by operations was $9.8 million, compared to $7.4 million in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	We attribute this increase of $2.3 million in significant part to our payment of $4.1 million in Fiscal 2012 of compensation expense that was accrued in Fiscal 2011 in connection with the separation of our former executive chairman.
844161_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 include: (i) an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to a decrease in accounts payable of $0.1 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to increased legal fees; (ii) an increase in accounts receivable of $0.2 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to an increase of $1.3 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to reduced royalty revenue due from Tesco; and (iii) stock based compensation expense of $1.0 million in Fiscal 2013 as compared to $0.6 million in Fiscal 2012, which we attribute primarily to our issuance of more stock options in Fiscal 2013 than in Fiscal 2012.
844161_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	During Fiscal 2014, cash used by investing activities was $19.7 million, as compared to $18.5 million in Fiscal 2013.

844161_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	In Fiscal 2012, we did not make any trademark purchases, and the net cash used in investing activities was comprised of $0.7 million for our purchase of property and equipment and $0.2 million for trademark registration fees and renewal costs.
844161_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	During Fiscal 2014, cash received from financing activities was $12.3 million, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $3.7 million in Fiscal 2013.

844161_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	On September 4, 2012, and in connection with our acquisition of the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, Cherokee and JPMorgan Chase (or "JPMorgan") entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), which was amended on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	The Credit Agreement was further amended on January 10, 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" brands (the "Hawk Acquisition").
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Effective January 10, 2014, Cherokee and JP Morgan entered into amendments to each of (i) the Credit Agreement, (ii) the existing Term Note, which was originally issued by Cherokee in favor of JPMorgan as of September 4, 2012 and previously amended by the parties effective January 31, 2013 (as amended, the "2013 Term Note") and (iii) the Line of Credit Note, which was issued by Cherokee in favor of JPMorgan as of September 4, 2012 (as amended, the "Revolver").
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan issued to Cherokee a new term note (the "2014 Term Note" and, together with the foregoing amendments, the "Loan Agreement Amendments") in the principal sum equal to the purchase price in the Hawk Acquisition, or $19 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	The principal outstanding under the 2014 Term Note is to be repaid on a quarterly basis, commencing on February 28, 2014 and continuing thereafter through November 30, 2018 in equal principal installments of $0.95 million, except that that the initial payment equaled approximately $0.63 million and the final payment equals approximately $0.32 million.
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	The 2014 Term Note bears interest equal to either: (i) an adjusted annual LIBOR rate reset monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly, plus 2.75% or 3.00% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio or (ii) JPMorgan's annual prime rate or such annual prime rate plus 0.25% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio, with a floor equal to the 1 month LIBOR Rate plus 2.5%.
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the definition of "senior funded debt ratio" requires that Cherokee not exceed a ratio equal to (i) 2.50 to 1.00 until the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2014, (ii) 2.25 to 1.00 from the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2015 until the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016, and (iii) 2.00 to 1.00 thereafter.
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S5	Prior to the effectiveness of the January 2014 amendment to the Credit Agreement, such limitation on Cherokee's senior funded debt ratio was fixed at 2.00 to 1.00 for all periods.
844161_14_ITEM7_P79_S6	In addition, pursuant to the Loan Agreement Amendments, the interest rate that applies to the 2013 Term Note and to the Revolver was amended to equal either: (i) an adjusted annual LIBOR rate reset monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly, plus 2.25% or 2.5% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio or (ii) the Bank's annual prime rate or such annual prime rate plus 0.25% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio, with a floor equal to the 1 month LIBOR Rate plus 2.5%.
844161_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Following the issuance of the 2014 Term Note, Cherokee's total borrowings under the Credit Agreement (collectively, the "Loan") is evidenced by (i) the 2013 Term Note, which was issued in the principal amount of $16.6 million and of which approximately $13.0 million is outstanding as of February 1, 2014, (ii) the Revolver, which provides Cherokee with a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $2.0 million, none of which is outstanding as of February 1, 2014 and (iii) the 2014 Term Loan, which was issued in the principal amount of $19.0 million following the execution of the Loan Agreement Amendments.
844161_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	Cherokee paid an upfront fee equal to $0.95 million in connection with the issuance of the 2014 Term Loan.
844161_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Consistent with the existing terms of the Credit Agreement, the Loan is secured by continuing security agreements, trademark security agreements and continuing guarantees executed by Cherokee and its subsidiaries, as applicable.
844161_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	In addition, the Credit Agreement includes various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of Cherokee's business, including covenants that require Cherokee to obtain JPMorgan's consent in certain circumstances before Cherokee can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) make acquisitions, mergers or consolidations in excess of $5.0 million on an aggregate basis following the Hawk Acquisition, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to Cherokee's employee equity incentive plans or programs and (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to Cherokee's stockholders.
844161_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	The Credit Agreement also imposes financial covenants, including: (i) a minimum "fixed charge coverage ratio" of at least 1.2 to 1.0 and (ii) a limitation of Cherokee's "senior funded debt ratio" as described above.
844161_14_ITEM7_P81_S3	Further, Cherokee has granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of Cherokee's assets (including trademarks) as collateral for the Loan.
844161_14_ITEM7_P81_S4	In the event of a default under the Credit Agreement, the Bank has the right to terminate its obligations under the Credit Agreement, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the Credit Agreement and exercise its other rights including foreclosing on Cherokee's assets under the security agreements.
844161_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	On February 16, 2011, Cherokee and U.S. Bank National Association entered into a term loan agreement, which was amended on December 7, 2011.
844161_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	The amended loan agreement consisted of (i) a term loan in the principal amount of $5.0 million and a two year maturity date and (ii) a term loan in the principal amount of $2.0 million and a four year maturity.
844161_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	On June 5, 2012, Cherokee prepaid all outstanding principal and interest on the amended loan agreement.
844161_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Effective October 13, 2011, we entered into an Office Lease with Tri-Center Plaza, LP, pursuant to which we have leased certain premises of approximately 10,104 square feet located at 5990 Sepulveda Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California to serve as our corporate headquarters.
844161_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	The term of the lease commenced on November 1, 2011 and expires five years after the commencement date.
844161_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	Cherokee has an option to extend the term for an additional five years.
844161_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	In addition, Cherokee has a one-time option to terminate the lease after the third year of the lease.
844161_14_ITEM7_P83_S4	On December 5, 2013, we amended this lease to include an additional 1,295 square feet of office space within the same premises as our corporate headquarters.
844161_14_ITEM7_P83_S5	The amendment expires November 1, 2016.
844161_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The lease provides for base rent as follows:
844161_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	* Increased monthly base rent to commence upon the date of substantial completion of work related to the additional office space we have leased adjacent to our corporate headquarters, which we expect to occur during the first quarter of Fiscal 2015.
844161_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Our cash requirements through the end of Fiscal 2015 are primarily to fund operations, working capital, and at our discretion and subject to the terms of our credit agreement repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our Board of Directors, and, to a lesser extent, for capital expenditures.
844161_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock are subject to negative covenants contained in our credit agreement and, assuming the satisfaction or waiver by JPMorgan of such covenants, will be made at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board.
844161_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	We are frequently approached by parties seeking to sell their brands and related trademarks.
844161_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Should an established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider such an acquisition opportunity.
844161_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of February 1, 2014:
844161_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captioned "Fiscal 2015" starts February 2, 2014 and ends January 31, 2015.
844161_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	(b) Represents future minimum non-cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facilities in Sherman Oaks (including an amendment to the lease for additional space) and Huntington Beach, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota and our equipment leases for Sherman Oaks and Minneapolis.
844161_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	The Sherman Oaks lease is set to expire on November 1, 2016.
844161_14_ITEM7_P90_S2	There is one five-year option to extend this lease.

844161_14_ITEM7_P90_S4	There is one three-year option to extend this lease.
844161_14_ITEM7_P90_S5	The Huntington Beach lease is set to expire on June 30, 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	(c) Represents future interest and principal payments with respect to our credit agreement with JPMorgan.
844161_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	During Fiscal 2014, we announced dividends of $0.30 per share and paid during Fiscal 2014 cash dividends of $0.40 per share.
844161_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Since December 2003, we paid a cash dividend to our stockholders during each quarter through the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	The payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial conditions, results of operations, capital requirements, compliance with our credit agreement and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_14_ITEM7_P92_S3	Our Board of Directors may determine whether or not to pay dividends in future periods for any reason it deems relevant.
844161_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents currently on hand, and funds made available to us pursuant to our Revolver.
844161_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and access to funds pursuant to the Revolver, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and other commitments through the end of Fiscal 2015.
844161_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flow generated from operations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Some of the factors that could cause our revenues and cash flows to be materially lower are described under the caption titled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and under the caption title "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Item 7.
844161_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	As of February 1, 2014, we were not the guarantor of any other material third-party obligations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	As of February 1, 2014, we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2015 are lower than Fiscal 2014, we may not have cash available to pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock or to explore or consummate the acquisition of other brands, and we could fall out of compliance with the terms of our credit agreement.
844161_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	If our revenues and cash flows during Fiscal 2015 are materially lower than Fiscal 2014, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities.
844161_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	We believe that we will have sufficient cash generated from our business activities to support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	We have agreed to certain contractual royalty rate reductions with Target for its sales of Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S. in each fiscal year, which apply for future sales as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved.
844161_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	Historically, with Target, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future.
844161_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	The benign rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a material effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	Since most of our future revenues are based upon a percentage of sales of the licensed products by our licensees, we do not anticipate that short term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	The majority of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_14_ITEM7_P99_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_14_ITEM7_P99_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_14_ITEM7_P99_S3	As the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent periods, we believe the cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2014 in comparison to the comparable prior year periods was an approximate $0.1 million decrease in royalties for the Fourth Quarter and an approximate $0.5 million decrease for Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
844161_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	It requires entities to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by respective line items of net income (loss).
844161_14_ITEM7_P100_S2	This disclosure is required only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income (loss) in its entirety in the same reporting period.
844161_14_ITEM7_P100_S3	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income (loss), a cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts is required.
844161_14_ITEM7_P100_S4	The new guidance is effective for interim or fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
844161_14_ITEM7_P100_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.
844161_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires that an unrecognized tax benefit be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar loss or a tax credit carryforward, if specific criteria are met.
844161_14_ITEM7_P101_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
844161_14_ITEM7_P101_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high-quality issuers.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	In relation to our term loan with JPMorgan Chase, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have an immaterial impact on interest expense for Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Currency: We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates to the extent that the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuates in countries where our licensees do business.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	For Fiscal 2014, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 32% of our consolidated revenues.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	For Fiscal 2014, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the US dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where our licensees operate would have affected our revenues by approximately $0.9 million, which represents 3% of our total revenues reported for Fiscal 2014.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As a consequence, the past weakening of the U.S. dollar has benefited us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar has not benefited us.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P5_S3	In the future, should the dollar strengthen against such foreign currencies, the total royalty revenues reported by us from such licensees would reflect such changes in the currency exchange rates.
844161_14_ITEM7A_P5_S4	Accordingly, a strengthening dollar, compared to current exchange rates, would likely result in lower reported royalty revenues than otherwise would be reported as a result of such unfavorable exchange rate movements.
844161_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended February 1, 2014.

844161_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cherokee Inc. ("Cherokee, or the "Company") is in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Uniform, Sideout and Carole Little brands and related trademarks and other brands it owns or represents.
844161_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	Cherokee is one of the leading licensors of brand names and trademarks for apparel, footwear and accessories in the United States.
844161_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	On January 10, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Quiksilver, Inc. and Hawk Designs, Inc., to which the Company acquired various assets related to the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" signature apparel brands and related trademarks.
844161_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	As consideration for the acquisition, Cherokee agreed to pay a cash purchase price equal to $19,000.
844161_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
844161_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
844161_14_ITEM8_P17_S2	All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated during the consolidation process.
844161_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company's fiscal year comprises a 52 or 53 week period ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31.
844161_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	The fiscal years ended February 1, 2014 ("Fiscal 2014"), February 2, 2013 ("Fiscal 2013"), and January 28, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012") represent a 52 week period, a 53 week period and a 52 week period, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Receivables are reported at amounts the Company expects to be collected, net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
844161_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, such as: historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company's licensees, current economic conditions, bankruptcy, and other factors that may affect the licensees' ability to pay.
844161_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	There was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of February 1, 2014 or February 2, 2013.
844161_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance requiring entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
844161_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	It requires entities to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by respective line items of net income (loss).
844161_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	This disclosure is required only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income (loss) in its entirety in the same reporting period.
844161_14_ITEM8_P21_S3	For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income (loss), a cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts is required.
844161_14_ITEM8_P21_S4	The new guidance is effective for interim or fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
844161_14_ITEM8_P21_S5	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements or disclosures.
844161_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires that an unrecognized tax benefit be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar loss or a tax credit carryforward, if specific criteria are met.
844161_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2013.
844161_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company has reclassified certain prior year amounts within the consolidated balance sheets to conform to the Company's current year presentation.
844161_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, stock based compensation and income taxes.
844161_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
844161_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_14_ITEM8_P24_S4	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased and money market funds purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
844161_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer's price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
844161_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Revenues from arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received or billable by the Company in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of the Company, are deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from the Company's licensees.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Company's royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The Company's agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand in the U.S. accounts for the majority of the Company's historical revenues and is structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	With respect to Target's sales in the U.S. of Cherokee branded products other than in the school uniforms category and adult products sold on Target dotcom, revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data as defined sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	As a result, the Company's royalty revenues as a percentage of Target's retail sales in the U.S. are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease during the fiscal year as Target exceeds sales thresholds as set forth in the Company's agreement with Target.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S5	The amount of Cherokee brand royalty revenue earned by the Company from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target's cumulative level of retail sales for Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S6	Historically, with Target, this has caused the Company's first quarter to be the Company's highest revenue and profitability quarter and the Company's fourth quarter to be the Company's lowest quarter.
844161_14_ITEM8_P27_S7	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the execution of new license agreements and retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter from Target and also on the revenues the Company receives from Target or other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, including with respect to the Company's Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands as well as Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category, Cherokee adult products sold on Target dotcom, and the recently acquired Tony Hawk brand.
844161_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	In order to ensure that Cherokee's licensees are appropriately reporting and calculating royalties owed to Cherokee, all of Cherokee's license agreements include audit rights to allow Cherokee to validate the royalties paid.
844161_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Any revenue resulting from these audits, or other audits, is recognized in the financial statement of the current reporting period.
844161_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Licensing revenue is recognized gross of withholding taxes that are remitted by the Company's licensees directly to their local tax authorities.
844161_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Deferred revenues represent minimum licensee revenue royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non-refundable to the licensee.
844161_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	Deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Deferred financing costs and debt discounts are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the life of the debt.
844161_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Property and equipment consist of the following:
844161_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
844161_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
844161_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or retired are written off, and the resulting gains or losses are included in current operations.
844161_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.
844161_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Computers and related equipment and software are depreciated over three years.
844161_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Furniture and store fixtures are depreciated over the shorter of seven years, or the term of the license agreement.
844161_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of five years, or the life of the lease term.
844161_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	Depreciation expense was $352, $203, and $116 for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013, and Fiscal 2012, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company holds various trademarks including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line, All That Jazz , and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in a number of other countries.
844161_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	The Company also holds trademark applications for Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Sideout Sport, Carole Little, Chorus Line, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz, and others in numerous countries.
844161_14_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company intends to renew these registrations, as appropriate, prior to expiration.
844161_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company monitors on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of the Company's trademarks, and relies primarily upon a combination of trademark, copyright, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect the Company's intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Trademark registration and renewal fees are capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
844161_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Trademark acquisitions are capitalized and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or are capitalized as indefinite-lived assets, if no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit its useful life to Cherokee.
844161_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment, at least annually.
844161_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
844161_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
844161_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The carrying amount receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
844161_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Long-term debt approximates fair value due to the variable rate nature of the debt.
844161_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The realizability of long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount.
844161_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	Long-lived assets that will no longer be used in business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the Company.
844161_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	Periodically, long lived assets that will continue to be used by the Company need to be evaluated for recoverability.
844161_14_ITEM8_P41_S3	Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections.
844161_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	The estimated undiscounted cash flows used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement is considered a Level 3 input, which consist of unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
844161_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	These inputs would be based on the best information available, including the Company's own data.
844161_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_14_ITEM8_P43_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_14_ITEM8_P43_S3	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
844161_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.
844161_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
844161_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	Cherokee limits credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with quality financial institutions.
844161_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	At fiscal year-end February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, the Company's cash and cash equivalents exceeded FDIC limits.
844161_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are minimal due to the limited amount of open receivables and due to the nature of the Company's licensing royalty revenue program.

844161_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
844161_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	Diluted EPS is similar to the computation for basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
844161_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	However, nonvested restricted stock awards (referred to as participating securities) are excluded from the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding in accordance with authoritative guidance under the two-class method since the nonvested restricted stockholders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock as if the shares were fully vested and hence are deemed to be participating securities.
844161_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to nonvested restricted stockholders are excluded from net earnings attributable to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share.

844161_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	When the Company reissues treasury stock, and the proceeds from the sale exceed the average price that was paid by the Company to acquire the shares, the Company records such excess as an increase in additional paid-in capital.
844161_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price the Company paid to acquire the shares, the Company records such difference as a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded, with the balance recorded as a decrease in retained earnings.
844161_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	When a lease includes lease incentives (such as a rent abatement) or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and amounts payable under the lease is included in deferred rent and lease incentives in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
844161_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	For leasehold allowances, the Company records a deferred lease credit on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred lease credit as a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of income over the term of the leases.

844161_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the consolidated statements of income.
844161_14_ITEM8_P96_S2	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures over the award's service period.

844161_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term.
844161_14_ITEM8_P100_S2	The dividend yield is based on the past dividends paid and the current dividend yield at the time of grant.
844161_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	A summary of activity for the Company's stock options as of and for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 is as follows:
844161_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the plans for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 was $4.09, $3.23, and $6.89, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on February 1, 2014 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on February 1, 2014 (the last trading day).
844161_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock.
844161_14_ITEM8_P103_S2	The total intrinsic value of options exercised for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 was $6, $8 and $16, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	As of February 1, 2014, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $1,300, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.00 years.
844161_14_ITEM8_P104_S1	The total fair value of all options which vested during Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 was approximately $800, $1,100, and $500, respectively.
844161_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	On April 15, 2013 and on July 16, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors granted certain performance-based equity awards to executives under the Company's 2006 Stock Plan.
844161_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	The performance metric applicable to such awards is compound stock price growth, using the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on February 1, 2013, or $13.95, as the benchmark.
844161_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	The target growth rate is 10% annually, which results in an average share price target of (i) $15.35 for Fiscal 2014, (ii) $16.88 for Fiscal 2015 and (iii) $18.57 for the Company's fiscal year ending in 2016.
844161_14_ITEM8_P106_S2	The average share price will be calculated as the average of all market closing prices during the January preceding fiscal year end.
844161_14_ITEM8_P106_S3	If a target is met at the end of a fiscal year, one third of the shares subject to the award will vest.
844161_14_ITEM8_P106_S4	If the stock price target is not met, the relevant portion of the shares subject to the award will not vest but will roll over to the following fiscal year.
844161_14_ITEM8_P106_S5	The executive must continue to be employed by the Company through the relevant vesting dates to be eligible for vesting.
844161_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	Since the vesting of these performance-based equity awards are subject to performance conditions, the fair value of these awards were measured on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model for each vesting tranche.
844161_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the performance units granted.
844161_14_ITEM8_P107_S2	The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions and the resulting fair value of the award.
844161_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Compensation expense on shares of restricted stock and performance stock, was approximately $200, $10 and $0 for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012, respectively.

844161_14_ITEM8_P112_S5	Prior to the effectiveness of the January 2014 amendment to the Credit Agreement, such limitation on Cherokee's senior funded debt ratio was fixed at 2.00 to 1.00 for all periods.

844161_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	Consistent with the existing terms of the Credit Agreement, the Loan is secured by continuing security agreements, trademark security agreements and continuing guarantees executed by Cherokee and its subsidiaries, as applicable.
844161_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	In addition, the Credit Agreement includes various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of Cherokee's business, including covenants that require Cherokee to obtain JPMorgan's consent in certain circumstances before Cherokee can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) make acquisitions, mergers or consolidations in excess of $5,000 on an aggregate basis following the Hawk Acquisition, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to Cherokee's employee equity incentive plans or programs and (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to Cherokee's stockholders.

844161_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and procedures.

844161_14_ITEM9A_P4_S2	The remediation efforts included hiring third parties to evaluate and assist management in changing logical access controls to ensure proper segregation of duties, increasing management's use of appropriately qualified third party advisors to assist management with the preparation of our quarterly and annual income tax provisions and uncertain tax position liability, and utilization of third party software programs and resources to assist management with the documentation of the stock based awards' fair value calculations to facilitate management's analysis of data required to determine the fair value of our stock based compensation awards.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We also allocated appropriate, qualified resources to reconcile all balance sheet accounts and credit card expenses on a monthly basis and required formal reviews and signoffs of the reconciliations by the appropriate level of management.

844161_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

844161_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Cherokee is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Carole Little and le by alessandra brands and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	We are one of the leading global licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	We own several trademarks, including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others.
844161_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	We enter into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations to provide them the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to provide them our proprietary 360-degree turn-key solution for product development, marketing services, support services and strategic sales initiatives.
844161_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	As of January 31, 2015, we had thirty-one continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets, fourteen of which pertained to the Cherokee brand.
844161_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	In addition to licensing our own brands, we also assist other brand-owners and companies in identifying opportunities as a licensee or licensor for their brands or stores and partner with individuals to market and license their lifestyle brands, such as our partnership with Alessandra Ambrosio for the le by alessandra brand.
844161_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Cherokee was incorporated in Delaware in 1988.
844161_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our principal executive offices are located at 5990 Sepulveda Boulevard, Sherman Oaks, California 91411, telephone (818) 908-9868.
844161_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	We maintain a website with the address www.cherokeeglobalbrands.com.
844161_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
844161_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our primary emphasis is domestic and international direct to retail licensing, which we refer to as our "Direct to Retail" or "DTR" licensing model.
844161_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We collaborate with our licensees' product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or expand the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	In many cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although many products are subject to our pre-approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards, and many marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	Wholesale licensing, on the other hand, generally involves licensing to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P7_S4	Although we have some wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands, most of our licensees are retail licensees and we plan to continue to solicit new licensees using our Direct to Retail licensing model in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand our business.
844161_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Over the past two decades, the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, as it generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering licensees the ability to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Typically, this differentiation also provides the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a "premium" over private label price points, which can result in increased profit margins, even after royalties have been paid to the licensor.
844161_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	The licensees generally directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating the licensor's exposure to inventory risk while allowing the licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Many of the world's largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands within the DTR licensing model.
844161_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Examples of retailers actively participating in the DTR licensing model include Target, Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Kohl's and C A, among others.
844161_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our Direct to Retail licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that, for many retailers in various countries worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, footwear and accessories business, including product development, design, merchandising, sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers themselves, who not only command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with their end consumers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	We believe that these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by directly designing, sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than by carrying strictly private label goods or branded products obtained from third-party vendors.
844161_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also expect that the enhanced profitability achievable with our Direct to Retail strategy, coupled with the substantial marketing costs to establish and maintain an in-store brand, will continue to increase the desirability of our strategy to retailers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our primary strategy is to capitalize on these trends by licensing our portfolio of brand names directly to retailers around the world, who, working in conjunction with us, develop merchandise for their stores, and to augment our current portfolio by acquiring additional brands that have high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a range of merchandise categories.
844161_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that our core strengths position us to expand our business and enhance stockholder value through execution of our proprietary 360-degree turn-key solution.
844161_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Cherokee provides its licensees with a proprietary 360-degree turn-key solution that seamlessly integrates with the DTR model.
844161_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our retail-responsiveness process and 360-degree unique value proposition have allowed for Cherokee to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of the retailers that are selling our portfolio of lifestyle brands.
844161_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that are constantly being measured, evaluated and incorporated into our 360-degree turn-key solution, we believe Cherokee has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our global strategic initiatives currently include the following:
844161_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Product Design and Development Our product design and development activities are led by design teams based in Los Angeles and Minneapolis.
844161_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	These teams work collectively with the licensees for each of our brands to develop a story, point-of-view and point-of-difference, develop product guidelines, including graphic language, fabrics, quality details and trim, and oversee execution to maintain brand integrity.
844161_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	These teams also assist in developing innovative seasonal product design concepts for our brands to maximize organic growth opportunities.
844161_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our support services teams provide marketing and other support to our licensees, including providing retail analytics data and marketing research about consumer insights and trends and identifying and sharing approved global sourcing and manufacturing vendors.
844161_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our marketing services are designed to evolve and strengthen the positioning of our brands in collaboration with our retail partners on a direct-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer basis by, among other things, creating enhanced in-store experiences with the introduction of custom design fixtures and visual displays, developing an integrated retail strategy across all consumer touch-points, including in-store, social media and other online avenues and cultivating relationships with credible brand ambassadors.
844161_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	These initiatives, which aim to achieve strategic revenue growth, include, among others, customized sales and merchandising plans for each of our brands and routine analysis of sales patterns to direct our geographic, product category and brand expansion efforts.
844161_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have two strategic platforms for the future growth of our licensing business.
844161_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Organic Growth This involves introducing new product categories with existing partners and expanding existing brands into new territories.
844161_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We are focused on the following organic growth drivers: a larger online presence with our partners; enhanced in-store experiences, such as shop-in-shop floor presentations; category expansion into home, footwear, and essentials; and partner expansion with more stores.
844161_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	This involves acquiring and representing new brands.
844161_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We target style-focused lifestyle brands, such as our recently acquired Tony Hawk and Liz Lange brands.
844161_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	Potential new brands must be able to have a global platform and product category expansion opportunities.
844161_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Cherokee markets both owned brands and brands it represents.
844161_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Generally, when representing brands, we perform a range of services including marketing of brands, solicitation of licensees, contract negotiations, and administration and maintenance of license or distribution agreements.
844161_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	In exchange for our services, we normally receive a certain percentage of the net royalties generated by the brands we represent and for which we establish a licensing arrangement.
844161_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	A summary of some of our owned brands and other brand representations is included below.
844161_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Today, our brands are licensed with retail and wholesale licensees in over fifty countries and approaching 7,000 retail locations.
844161_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	We continue to solicit additional licensees for all our brands internationally.
844161_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Cherokee is an iconic, American family-lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual and comfortable products at affordable prices.
844161_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Cherokee, which was initially launched as a footwear line in 1973, seeks to produce timeless classics, inspired by vintage Americana while continually being updated to account for modern trends.
844161_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	After four decades, the Cherokee brand stands for confident, effortless and relaxed American style.
844161_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	We believe this heritage positions the Cherokee brand for future growth and further international expansion.
844161_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Cherokee brand's most significant licensee is Target, which launched the Cherokee brand almost two decades ago as a multi-category product offering that encompasses kid's apparel, accessories, footwear and school uniforms (the rights to which we acquired in January 2013).
844161_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	Internationally, additional categories of Cherokee branded products are sold, including adult apparel, home d cor, textiles, outdoor furnishings and camping gear.
844161_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Licensing revenues for our Cherokee brand totaled $26.5 million, $24.7 million and $24.1 million in Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively, which represented 76%, 86% and 91%, respectively, of our total revenues for such periods.
844161_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Liz Lange has gained wide acceptance as a modern "maternity and beyond" designer brand that brings women versatile, comfortable, affordable and flattering style for every stage of pregnancy.
844161_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Liz Lange maternity apparel debuted in over 1,500 Target stores in the United States in 2002 and continues to be sold exclusively in Target stores in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	During 2010, Completely Me by Liz Lange was launched exclusively on the Home Shopping Network in the United States and The Shopping Channel in Canada.
844161_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Completely Me brand consists of sophisticated and comfortable casual clothing and sportswear for women.
844161_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	We acquired the Liz Lange brands in September 2012.
844161_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Tony Hawk, among the most well-known athletes in skateboarding history, is the founder of the Tony Hawk clothing line.
844161_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Designed for comfort, flexibility and durability, the clothing line is designed to embody the "skate culture" lifestyle, combining style and performance.
844161_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	We acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands in January 2014, which further expands our presence in department store and specialty channels of distribution.
844161_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	The brand is, and we expect will continue to be, exclusively licensed in the United States to Kohl's, with Tony Hawk clothing and accessories sold in Kohl's department stores and online.
844161_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	Separate wholesale license agreements are in place to supply Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel in Canada and we intend to secure additional licensees to expand these brands globally.
844161_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Licensing revenues for our Hawk and Tony Hawk brands totaled $4.9 million in Fiscal 2015, which represented 14% or our total revenues for such period.
844161_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	Conceived in 1983 by a California volleyball player, our owned Sideout brand took root at the beach, harnessing the easy spirit of a casual California lifestyle.
844161_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	Ideal for a game of beach volleyball or a breezy vacation, Sideout products perform in quality, functionality and originality by offering casual, hip and cool clothing, footwear and accessories at affordable prices.
844161_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Carole Little was founded in 1975 by designer Carole Little through her love for contemporary clothing.
844161_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our Carole Little owned brand became recognized for colorful and unusual prints, soft two-piece outfits and dresses.
844161_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Carole Little brand has an ageless, independent attitude for the self-confident woman.
844161_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	Inspired by the life and style of global international fashion icon Alessandra Ambrosio, the le by alessandra brand brings a "Brazil-bohemia meet Malibu-chic" collection of feminine, colorful and effortless apparel to savvy, fashion-minded women around the world.
844161_15_ITEM1_P32_S1	Like Alessandra, the le by alessandra customer has a personal style that is casual, chic and effortlessly cool.
844161_15_ITEM1_P32_S2	We are representing the le by alessandra brand, which debuted at Planet Blue and at Lunada Bay in 2014.
844161_15_ITEM1_P32_S3	Beginning in spring of 2015, Oxford Ophthalmic, Physician Endorsed and Esquire Footwear are debuting lines of le by alessandra eyewear, hats, totes and casual footwear.
844161_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	Our rights to receive royalties for sales of products bearing our brands are set forth in the terms of our license agreements with various retailers and wholesalers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	Generally, royalty rates for our DTR licenses vary as a percentage of the retailer's net sales of licensed products.
844161_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	In some cases, royalty rates are calculated based upon fixed percentages of product sales.
844161_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	In other cases, the royalty rates we receive may decrease depending on the retailer's annual sales of licensed products and the retailer's guaranteed annual sales of licensed products, which decreased royalty rate would not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the applicable fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	For instance, our arrangement with Target provides for, with respect to certain product categories, royalty rate reductions once specified cumulative levels of sales for Cherokee branded products in these product categories are achieved by Target during each fiscal year and, with respect to other product categories, fixed royalty rates that apply irrespective of sales volume.
844161_15_ITEM1_P33_S5	The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary depending on the terms of each licensing agreement.
844161_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	In most cases, we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum dollar amount of retail sales.
844161_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	These minimum guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	In the case of Target, its minimum royalty payment was $10.5 million for Fiscal 2014 and 2015.
844161_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	As of January 31, 2015, we had contractual rights to receive over $60 million forward-facing minimum royalty revenues over the next several years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our rights to such contractual minimums are primarily the result of our license agreement with Target for our Cherokee brand, which extends through January 2017, and our license agreement with Kohl's for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands, which extends through January 2018.
844161_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period that has been defined in the applicable license agreement.
844161_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	In order to ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license agreements grant us the right to audit our licensees' retail sales data for our brands to validate the amount of the royalties paid.
844161_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	We have licensed our brands and the brands we represent to numerous different retailers and wholesalers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	Two of our most significant Direct to Retail licensees are Target and Kohl's.
844161_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Pursuant to one of our license agreements with Target, Target maintains exclusive rights to the Cherokee brand in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S.
844161_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our U.S. license with Target, which excludes sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada, Cherokee branded adult products sold on Target's website and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, provides for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	These royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to Target's retail sales since the beginning of the year, but rather apply only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume.
844161_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	Our license with Target governing sales of Cherokee branded adult products sold on Target's website and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category provides for a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of products during each fiscal quarter.
844161_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	In January 2015, Target announced its decision to discontinue its operations in Canada.
844161_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our license agreement with Target for Cherokee branded products was amended in January 2013 to include a multi-year license in the category of school uniforms, following our acquisition of such rights from a third party.
844161_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	The license agreement was further amended in April 2013 to provide for a fixed royalty rate for sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category made through Target's website.
844161_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	The license agreement was again amended in January 2014 to renew and extend its term through January 31, 2017.
844161_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	In addition, Target now has the right to renew the Target license agreement for successive two-year periods, provided that it satisfied the minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $10.5 million for the preceding fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	During September 2012, we assumed an additional license agreement with Target covering sales of Liz Lange branded products in the U.S. Pursuant to such agreement, Target is obligated to pay us a fixed royalty rate based on Target's net sales of products bearing this brand.
844161_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Royalty revenues from Target U.S. for the Cherokee brand, which excludes sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category were $15.0 million during Fiscal 2015, $15.3 million during Fiscal 2014 and $15.0 million during Fiscal 2013, which accounted for 43%, 53%, and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	The termination of our license agreement with Target for Cherokee branded products would have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	In connection with our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands in January 2014, Cherokee entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl's.
844161_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Pursuant to this license agreement, Kohl's maintains exclusive rights to the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S.
844161_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our license with Kohl's provides for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to Kohl's retail sales since the beginning of the year, but rather apply only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume.
844161_15_ITEM1_P43_S4	The current term of the license agreement with Kohl's continues through January 31, 2018, and obligates Kohl's to pay Cherokee an annual minimum guaranteed royalty of $4.8 million.
844161_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	We have continuing international license agreements for the Cherokee brand and our other brands with leading retailers in over fifty countries.
844161_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	We license to retailers such as RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, and Nishimatsuya.
844161_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	We have also entered into a new Direct to Retail licensing agreement with Argos, a subsidiary of Home Retail Group plc, to launch a broad assortment of Cherokee lifestyle products online, in catalog and in more than 750 Argos stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland in the fall of 2015.
844161_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	We hold various trademarks, including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in a number of other countries.
844161_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	We also hold trademark applications for each of these brand names in numerous countries.
844161_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	Our business is dependent upon our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
844161_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of our trademarks, and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Royalties paid to us pursuant to our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of the licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Our owned and represented Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Carole Little, le by alessandra and other brands are subject to intense competition by numerous domestic and foreign brands.
844161_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	Competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona and Route 66.
844161_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	In recognition of what we believe is an increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de-emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, and our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We also face competition from other companies owning established trademarks, such as Iconix Brand Group, Phillips-Van Heusen, Perry Ellis International and VF Corp., which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers in the U.S. and internationally, including with our existing retail partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention and limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In addition to the other information contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by any forward-looking statement we may make herein, in any other document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report are not the only ones we face.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensee's net sales of licensed products.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Cherokee, Carole Little and Sideout brand footwear, apparel, and accessories, together with merchandise bearing our Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk and Tony Hawk brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona, and Route 66.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer's ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In recognition of what we believe is an increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de-emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, and our licensees' ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Failures with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We cannot control the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and changing preferences and trends may lead customers to purchase other products.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Further, we cannot control the level of resources that our licensees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support other brands to the detriment of our brands because our license agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing from our competitors.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, we complete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers in the U.S. and internationally, including with our existing retail partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention and limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	There are numerous risks and other factors applicable to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees) that can impact the sale of products that bear our brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Any decline in sales by one or more of our licensees can adversely affect our revenues.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	that impact supply chains and transport vendors, such as the recent labor strikes impacting ports in California and the Pacific Northwest and products that move through these channels; (ix) the impact of excess retail capacity; (x) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (xi) material acquisitions or dispositions; (xii) investments in new business strategies; (xiii) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xiv) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; (xv) security breaches; (xvi) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events; and (xvii) the other risks discussed in this Item 1A. For example, we believe that sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the United States after the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 were adversely impacted following Target's announcement of unauthorized access to payment card data in U.S. stores, which resulted in fewer revenues to Cherokee than we otherwise may have received from Target absent such announcement.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We rely on the accuracy of our licensees' retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Most of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands for manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands in their stores and on their websites.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Under our existing agreements, these licensees pay us licensing fees based in part on the retail value of products sold.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We rely on our licensees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections and budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	All of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If any of our licensee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our business is dependent on the success of our Direct to Retail licensing model.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In many cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although we typically collaborate with our licensees' product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Over the past two decades, the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, and our business plan is largely based on the continued success of this model with our current licensees and with new retailers we may solicit to license our brands in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand our business.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Although we believe there are increasing trends towards consolidation of retailers and de-emphasis on the manufacture of private label merchandise, which would support the growth of our Direct to Retail licensing model, this belief may turn out to be wrong.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	If our current or potential future retail licensees do not perceive our Direct to Retail licensing model to be advantageous to them, then they may move away from this model and instead embrace alternatives, such as purchasing from wholesalers or manufacturing private label products.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Such a change in perception could occur for a variety of reasons, including reasons based on retailers' beliefs or expectations that do not turn out to be accurate.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If our Direct to Retail licensing model ceases to be attractive to retailers, then we would be unable to continue to pursue our business plan and our financial condition and prospects would be severely harmed.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our business is largely dependent on royalties from Target.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target accounted for greater than 40% of our consolidated revenues during each of Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014, and Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We could suffer substantially decreased royalty revenues and cash flow if Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products, even if Target continues to pay the minimum annual royalty of $10.5 million required under our license agreement with Target.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	For instance, in January 2015, Target announced the discontinuation of its operations in Canada.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Moreover, any further limitations of Target's operations could severely reduce its sales of products bearing our brands and its royalty payments to us.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Replacing the royalty payments received from Target would be a significant challenge and we might not be successful in doing so, and the termination of this license agreement, which currently extends through January 31, 2017, would have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	In addition, in September 2012 we expanded our relationship with Target as a result of our assumption of an additional license agreement with Target for the Liz Lange brand, which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of assets related to such brand.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We further expanded our relationship with Target in connection with our January 2013 acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We acquired the Liz Lange brand as well as our rights to the Cherokee brand for the school uniforms category in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for this brand and the school uniforms category will grow in future periods, although such revenue growth may never occur.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	As a result of our reliance on Target, our continued success is dependent on various factors affecting Target's business, including, for example, perceptions of Target by consumers in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	For example, we believe that sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the United States after the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 were adversely impacted following Target's announcement of unauthorized access to payment card data in U.S. stores.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Revenues from our Hawk and Tony Hawk brands depend entirely on Kohl's.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	In January 2014, we acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands from Quiksilver, Inc.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Concurrently with this acquisition, we entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl's , pursuant to which Kohl's is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We agreed to this exclusive license in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Kohl's for such brands will grow in future periods, although this expectation may turn out to be wrong and such revenue growth may never occur beyond the $4.8 million minimum annual royalty guaranteed under the license agreement.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The failure of our licensees to sell products bearing our brands or to pay us royalties for such products could result in a decline in our results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our licensing agreements.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although the licensing agreements for our brands in most cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees to satisfy their obligations under these agreements or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Further, while we are substantially dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl's, the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees to meet their financial obligations to us could materially and adversely impact our results of operation and our financial condition.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and its corresponding impact on levels of consumer spending, which may affect our licensees' sales.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	During periods of economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As a result, our operating results may be materially affected by trends in the United States or global economy.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Purchases of apparel, footwear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result, the risks associated with our business are generally more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition to decreased consumer spending generally, these periods may be accompanied by decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown or a lengthy or severe recession with respect to either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with our international licensees.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We market and license our brands outside the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Many of our licensees are located outside the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	During Fiscal 2015, greater than 30% of our revenues were derived from our international licensees.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers; (iii) difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to manage foreign licensees; (iv) competition from foreign companies; (v) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (vi) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property; (vii) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (viii) fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and the cost of currency exchange; (ix) potentially adverse tax consequences; and (x) cultural differences in the conduct of business.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Additionally, and because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees' operations may negatively impact our royalty revenues.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights or that we will not become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We hold various trademarks for our brands, including Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout and Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in numerous other countries and we also hold trademark applications for these brands in a number of other countries, although the laws of many countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	These actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not prevent imitation of our products, infringement of our intellectual property rights by unauthorized parties or other challenges to our intellectual property ownership, or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If any of these events occurs, our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	In the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and one or more parties may assert infringement claims against us.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We may become involved in other litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations, audits and proceedings.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board or Directors, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp's and our other executives' leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may encounter difficulties in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from these transactions.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	During the past three years, we have consummated three such acquisitions: our acquisition of the Liz Lange brands in September 2012; our acquisition of various rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in January 2013; and our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands in January 2014.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, in February 2013, we commenced a relationship with Alessandra Ambrosio to market and represent her brand le by alessandra .
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio of products and services or expand the breadth of our markets.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Our history of acquiring and integrating acquisitions is limited, and we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio of brands, which could pose substantial challenges for management.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S6	Acquisitions and other strategic transactions can involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including, among others: (i) problems assimilating the brands; (ii) significant future charges relating the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) problems maintaining and enforcing standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems; (iv) difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses; (v) unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, including accounting and legal charges, capital expenditures, and transaction expenses; (vi) diversion of management's attention from our core business or our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with our partners; and (viii) risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transaction that we pursue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition, future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	If we finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If we finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing debt, we may become over-levered and our ability to operate the Company may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, we may experience or incur contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill or trademarks in connection with such transactions.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Any of these effects could harm our operating results or financial condition.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our level of indebtedness, and covenant restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In order to fund our acquisition of the Liz Lange brands, we entered into a credit facility with JPMorgan on September 4, 2012.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We initially increased the size of our credit facility on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We further increased the size of our credit facility on January 10, 2014 in connection with our acquisition of various assets related to the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The size of our credit facility currently totals $37.6 million, of which approximately $25 million was outstanding as of January 31, 2015, and is evidenced by (i) two five -year term notes, which were issued on January 31, 2013 and January 10, 2014 in the principal amounts of $16.6 million and $19 million, respectively, and (ii) a three -year revolving line of credit, pursuant to which we may borrow up to $2 million in principal.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our indebtedness under the credit facility could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things: making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development and capital expenditures and other business activities; making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition, the terms of our indebtedness contain various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain JPMorgan's consent before we can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) consummate acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans or programs, or (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The credit facility also imposes financial covenants, including a minimum "fixed charge coverage ratio" of at least 1.2 to 1.0 and a limitation of our "senior funded debt ratio" to not exceed a ratio equal to (i) 2.25 to 1.00 through our fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016, and (ii) 2.00 to 1.00 thereafter.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Further, as collateral for the credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by Cherokee's wholly owned subsidiaries.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In the event of a default under the credit facility, JPMorgan has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit facility, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit facility and exercise its other rights including foreclosing on our assets under the related security agreements.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in a material adverse effect to our business, including our financial condition and our liquidity.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available when needed, on favorable terms, or at all.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders, and if we incur additional debt to raise funds, we may become over-levered and our ability to operate the Company may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P46_S4	If we cannot raise funds when needed and on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P46_S5	This may materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of Cherokee branded products and products bearing our other brands and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on these initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long term, we may not be successful in doing so and such initiatives may not result in the intended benefits.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The determination regarding the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and there we may not pay any dividends in future periods, whether or not we generate sufficient cash to do so.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, pursuant to our credit facility with JPMorgan, we are prohibited from paying dividends without JPMorgan's consent and in the event that we would be in violation of our covenant regarding our "fixed charge coverage ratio" after giving effect to any proposed dividend or are otherwise then in default of such agreement.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in upgrading, transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity and other system failures.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our licensees are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Although we have not experienced any such cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date, some of our licensees, including Target, have experienced such events.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	If such an event were to occur to our internal systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if possible, loss of or damage to our data or applications, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, or the incurrence of other material liabilities.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If additional such events were to occur to our licensees' systems, our royalty revenues could be reduced or disrupted due to decreased sales of our branded products as a result of reputational damage or diversion of costs and other resources from selling products bearing our brands.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Any of these events could severely harm our business, results of operations and prospects.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or by our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, our existing license agreements, our existing brand representations, new license agreements, new brand representations or acquisition, strategic alliances or other transactions, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Further, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Subject to the approval of JPMorgan pursuant to our credit facility, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	For instance, such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, could have superior voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or could have other terms that negatively impact the voting control or other rights of our common stockholders.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Additionally, the ownership interest of holders of our common stock would be diluted following the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our effective income tax rates could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	We may come under audit by tax authorities, where these authorities may evaluate and disagree with our judgments regarding our tax provisions.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S6	Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P61_S7	In addition, changes in tax rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if repeated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Management has previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of Fiscal 2013 and during the first three quarters of Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	During Fiscal 2014, we developed and implemented a remediation plan that was designed to address these material weaknesses.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P63_S4	While we believe our remedial measures have sufficiently addressed our previously identified material weaknesses, it is possible that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P63_S5	In this case, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In addition, while we believe we have strengthened our controls and procedures, our current controls and procedures may not be adequate in future periods to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards, we may be unable to conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in ensuring the reliability of our financial reports.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and financial condition could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Moreover, our reputation with lenders, retailers, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Compliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards will increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Existing, changing and new laws, regulations, listing requirements and other standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure create uncertainty for public companies and significantly increase the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Our management team devotes significant time and financial resources to comply with existing and evolving standards for public companies.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including, for example, with respect to the preparation and filing of our financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S3	The existence of new and proposed laws and regulations relating to our financial reporting or that impose additional or more stringent compliance requirements on us could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S4	In addition, in order to comply with existing and any new or additional requirements, we may need to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies, which could significantly increase our costs and divert the time and attention of our management team away from revenue generating activities.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Notwithstanding our efforts, it is possible in future periods that our financial and other public reporting may not be considered timely, accurate or complete.
844161_15_ITEM1A_P66_S6	If reporting delays or errors actually occur, we could be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could adversely affect our financial results or result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information and other public disclosures, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
844161_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease an 11,399 square foot office facility in Sherman Oaks, California, which serves as our corporate headquarters.
844161_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	The current term of this lease ends on November 1, 2016, subject to our option to renew for an additional five-year term, for which we would need to give written notice no later than nine months prior to the date that the option period would commence.
844161_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our monthly base rent under this lease is currently $25,742.
844161_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also lease a 3,440 square foot office facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
844161_15_ITEM2_P0_S4	The current term of this lease ends on June 30, 2018, subject to our option to renew for an additional three-year term, for which we would need to give written notice no less than twelve months prior to the expiration of the current term.
844161_15_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our current monthly base rent under this lease is $3,727.
844161_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Both the Sherman Oaks and Minneapolis lease agreements include provisions allowing for early termination under certain conditions.
844161_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease a 2,032 square foot office facility in Huntington Beach, California.
844161_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	The current term of this lease ends on August 14, 2019, subject to our option to renew for an additional five-year term.
844161_15_ITEM2_P1_S3	Our current monthly base rent under this lease is $2,552.
844161_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
844161_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that could harm our business.
844161_15_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we or our wholly owned subsidiaries are a party that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol "CHKE".
844161_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below sets forth for each of the fiscal quarters during our last two fiscal years the range of the high and low sale prices for our common stock and the cash dividends declared and paid per share, if any.
844161_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	On April 10, 2015, the latest sale price for our common stock, reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, was $19.89 per share.
844161_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of April 10, 2015, the approximate number of stockholders of record of our common stock was 80.
844161_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	This figure does not include beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.
844161_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee's financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements, compliance with our credit facility with JPMorgan and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information about the restrictions on dividends contained in the credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly-traded licensing companies exists; hence, we compared the return on investment in our common stock to the S P 100-LTD and NASDAQ Composite Index.
844161_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing January 30, 2010 and ending on January 31, 2015.
844161_15_ITEM5_P6_S1	The data set forth below assumes the value of an investment in our common stock and each Index was $100 on January 30, 2010.
844161_15_ITEM5_P6_S2	The data set forth below also assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.
844161_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	The stock performance shown on the graph below should not be considered indicative of future stock price performance.
844161_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	During Fiscal 2015, we did not sell or offer to sell any securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
844161_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected consolidated financial information has been taken or derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of our results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes.
844161_15_ITEM6_P0_S2	See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data".
844161_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this annual report on Form 10-K (the "Annual Report").
844161_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current views, expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
844161_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Actual results may differ substantially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, among others, the risks described in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
844161_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	As used in this discussion and analysis, "Cherokee", the "Company", "we", "us" and "our" refer to Cherokee Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates or requires otherwise.
844161_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, as used herein, "Fiscal 2015" refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015; "Fiscal 2014" refers to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014; and "Fiscal 2013" refers to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	We have a 52- or 53- week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns us with our retail licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	This results in a 53- week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Each of Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 was a 52-week, 52-week and 53-week fiscal year, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods that may differ from ours.
844161_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year-to-year basis.
844161_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Cherokee is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Carole Little and le by alessandra brands and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	We are one of the leading global licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	We enter into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations to provide them the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to provide them our proprietary 360-degree turn-key solution.
844161_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Cherokee provides its licensees with a proprietary 360-degree turn-key solution that seamlessly integrates with the DTR model.
844161_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our retail-responsiveness process and 360-degree unique value proposition have allowed for Cherokee to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of the retailers that are selling our portfolio of lifestyle brands.
844161_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that are constantly being measured, evaluated and incorporated into our 360-degree turn-key solution, we believe Cherokee has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	We refer to this strategy as our "Direct to Retail" or "DTR" licensing model.
844161_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	As of January 31, 2015, we had thirty-one continuing license agreements covering both domestic and international markets, fourteen of which pertained to the Cherokee brand.
844161_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We derive revenues from licensing our trademarks to retailers all over the world.
844161_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our current retail licensee relationships cover over fifty countries and nearly 7,000 retail stores and online businesses and include relationships with Target, Kohl's, RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Nishimatsuya and Argos.
844161_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Our two most significant licensees are Target Corporation ("Target") and Kohl's Illinois, Inc. ("Kohl's").
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	Generally, royalty rates for our Direct to Retail license agreements vary as a percentage of the retailer's net sales of licensed products.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	In some cases, royalty rates are calculated based upon a fixed percentage of product sales.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	In other cases, including with Target and Kohl's, we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales of merchandise in certain product categories are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee's retail sales since the beginning of the year, but rather apply only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	For example, the amount of royalty revenue earned by us from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in that quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target's cumulative level of retail sales for certain Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees' retail sales are typically highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease if and when certain retail sales thresholds are met.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S6	Historically, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_15_ITEM7_P7_S7	However, such historical patterns and seasonal trends may vary significantly in future periods, depending upon retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter by Target and Kohl's, the revenues we receive from Target and our other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, and the terms of any new license agreements.
844161_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	The terms of our royalty arrangements vary for each of our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	In most cases we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum royalty.
844161_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	These minimum royalty guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	In the case of Target, its minimum annual guaranteed royalty was $10.5 million for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015, and in the case of Kohl's, its minimum annual guaranteed royalty was $4.8 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	As of January 31, 2015, we had contractual rights to receive $60 million forward-facing minimum royalty revenues over the next several years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our rights to such contractual minimums are primarily the result of our recent extension of our license agreement with Target for our Cherokee brand, which extends through January 2017, and our license agreement with Kohl's for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands, which extends through January 2018.
844161_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	However, our licensees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period-to-period fluctuations in retail sales of our branded products by our licensees in the specific territories in which they operate.
844161_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a result, and except as noted elsewhere in the comparisons of our three most recently completed fiscal years, we do not have sufficient information to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or mix of products sold by our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands.
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	In September 2012, we acquired the Liz Lange brand, which is among the most recognized maternity brands sold throughout North America, and the associated Completely Me by Liz Lange women's sportswear brand, for aggregate acquisition consideration of $14.0 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	In January 2013, we acquired additional rights to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms for aggregate acquisition consideration of $4.25 million, which expanded our overall product offering.
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	In January 2014, we acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands for aggregate acquisition consideration of $19.0 million, which expands our presence in department store and specialty channels of distribution.
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	In addition, in February 2013, we commenced a relationship with Alessandra Ambrosio to market and represent her brand le by alessandra .
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	We also regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our current brands into new geographic markets.
844161_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio of products and services or expand the breadth of our markets.
844161_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees' operations may impact our royalty revenues.
844161_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Additionally, we generally record the sales of our international licensees in U.S. dollars, and our disclosure related to the sales of such licensees throughout this Annual Report is denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
844161_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	In arriving at such denominations, we receive a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our licensees which are denominated in the applicable foreign currency.
844161_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	These amounts are then converted by us to U.S. dollars using the appropriate exchange rate for the purpose of disclosing all retail sales in U.S. dollars.
844161_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	For all periods presented in this Annual Report, we do not consider the period-to-period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on the accuracy of the U.S. dollar-denominated figures presented in this Annual Report.
844161_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
844161_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, deferred taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation and stock-based compensation.
844161_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
844161_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
844161_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our royalty revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Revenues are not recognized unless collectability is reasonably assured.
844161_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	Royalty agreements that account for the majority of our historical revenues are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by our licensees.
844161_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data after required sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_15_ITEM7_P18_S5	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year, and as a consequence such royalty rate reductions do not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We are responsible for the licensing and enforcement of our intellectual property and for pursuing third parties that are utilizing our assets without a license or who have under-reported the amount of royalties owed under a license agreement with us.
844161_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	As a result of these activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P19_S2	These royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P19_S3	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently audited or reported as an adjustment to those amounts due from licensees will be recognized as appropriate.
844161_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy because if the recognition policy or criteria were to change in the future, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
844161_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	A tax position is to be initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Such tax positions are to be initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance, which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.
844161_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if those estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for such assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	To date there has been no impairment of intangible assets or long-lived assets for continuing operations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	We evaluate contingent liabilities, including threatened or pending litigation, in accordance with authoritative guidance and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	We account for equity awards in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
844161_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	The fair value of stock options and other stock-based awards is estimated using option valuation models.
844161_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	These models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, risk free rate, dividend rate, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the graded amortization method.
844161_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated income statements.
844161_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if any of the estimates above require significant changes, these changes could result in fluctuating expenses that could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance relating to revenue from contracts with customers that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
844161_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
844161_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on our financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and requires additional disclosures if certain criteria are met.
844161_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2016.
844161_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
844161_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
844161_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following table sets forth certain of our consolidated financial data for the periods indicated.
844161_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results in the current period or in future periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	In Fiscal 2015, our revenues totaled $35.0 million, compared to $28.6 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and, to a lesser extent, to wholesalers and our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The increase in revenues of $6.4 million between periods is primarily attributable to royalties for our recently acquired Hawk and Tony Hawk brands and royalties from our international Cherokee licensees.
844161_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	Our Cherokee brand accounted for approximately 76% and 86% of our aggregate royalty revenues in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $381.0 million and $397.1 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	For Fiscal 2015, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.4 billion, versus $1.4 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Because we do not have direct oversight over our licensees, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given period.
844161_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved for Cherokee branded products and Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products in various product categories in the U.S., we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter will continue to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues by brand for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	As of the end of Fiscal 2015, Target had approximately 1,780 stores in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the U.S. were flat in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, at approximately $1.1 billion.
844161_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Target.
844161_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	The license agreement is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products in certain product categories in the U.S. during each fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	Target also pays fixed royalty rates for Target's sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada (until January 2015, when Target announced its decision to discontinue its operations in Canada), sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made by Target through its website (target.com) and sales of Cherokee branded products in the category of school uniforms.
844161_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	We do not expect the closure of Target's Canada stores to have a material impact on our revenues in future periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	We are currently considering other retail licensing options for our Cherokee branded products in Canada.
844161_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	In addition, in September 2012 we assumed a separate multi-year license agreement with Target in connection with our acquisition of the Liz Lange brand, pursuant to which Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of its products bearing such brand in the U.S.
844161_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Commencing with Fiscal 2014, the minimum annual royalty amount applicable to our license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand is $10.5 million, which applies to all sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. and, until January 2015, Canada, other than school uniforms, which are subject to a separate minimum annual royalty of $0.8 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	In Fiscal 2015, Target reached the guaranteed minimum annual royalty amount of $10.5 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S., which excludes sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category were $15.0 million in Fiscal 2015 and $15.3 million in Fiscal 2014, which accounted for 43%, and 53%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Target's U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 totaled $314.1 million, compared to $317.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, decreasing by approximately 1%.
844161_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 and $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, increasing by approximately 3%.
844161_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	The revenues increased slightly between periods in spite of a slight decline in retail sales due to the declining royalty rate threshold being satisfied earlier in Fiscal 2014 than in Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	As of the end of Fiscal 2015, Kohl's had approximately 1,162 stores in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Kohl's pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Kohl's.
844161_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	The license agreement is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Kohl's after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products in certain product categories in the U.S. during each fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	The minimum annual royalty amount applicable to our license agreement with Kohl's for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands is $4.8 million, which applies to all sales of Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products in the U.S.
844161_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Royalty revenues from sales of Cherokee branded products by Tesco, a former licensee, were $1.2 million for Fiscal 2015, compared to $0.8 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	We terminated our license agreement with Tesco as of January 31, 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	We have entered into a new license agreement with Argos, a subsidiary of Home Retail Group plc, to launch a broad assortment of Cherokee lifestyle products online, in catalog and in more than 750 Argos stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland in the fall of 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2015 increased to $8.9 million from $7.3 million in Fiscal 2014, representing a 22% increase.
844161_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	This total includes licensees for Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India, and other territories.
844161_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The majority of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against an international licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	As the U.S. dollar strengthened, the cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2015 in comparison to Fiscal 2014 was an approximate $0.4 million decrease.
844161_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail information regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, including amortization of trademarks, were $19.6 million for Fiscal 2015, compared to $18.6 million for Fiscal 2014, representing an increase of $1.0 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in expenses between periods is primarily due to expenses related to the marketing and design of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands acquired in Fiscal 2014 and increased marketing expenses associated with our Cherokee brand, offset by a decrease in corporate expenses primarily due to approximately $1.0 million of expenses incurred in Fiscal 2014 related to professional services for the acquisition of Hawk and Tony Hawk, which did not recur, and approximately $1.0 million of professional and consulting fees, which did not recur, in Fiscal 2014 related to the identification and remediation of weaknesses in internal control identified in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2015 was $0 million, compared to $0.02 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2015 was $0.9 million compared to $0.5 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	The increase in interest expense between periods was due to increased interest expense related to our increased debt, which was used to fund the acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands in January 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	For Fiscal 2015, we recorded a tax provision of $4.7 million, compared to $3.4 million for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our effective tax rate was 32% for Fiscal 2015 and 36% for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 in comparison to Fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon the conclusion during Fiscal 2015 of certain income tax examinations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2015 was $9.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $6.1 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	In Fiscal 2014, our revenues totaled $28.6 million, as compared to $26.6 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and to a lesser extent wholesalers and our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	The increase in revenues of $2.0 million is primarily from Liz Lange, Target Canada, Uniforms, Tony Hawk and other international licensees of $4.0 million partially offset by $2.0 million in decreased revenues from Zellers.
844161_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $397.1 million and $411.0 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	For Fiscal 2014, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.4 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	As the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent periods, we believe the cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2014 in comparison to the comparable prior year periods was an approximate $0.5 million decrease for Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues by brand for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Target currently has approximately 1,780 stores in the United States.
844161_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the U.S. were slightly higher in Fiscal 2014 at approximately $1.1 billion.
844161_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Target.
844161_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The license is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products during each fiscal year with respect to Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S.
844161_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	We have amended our agreement with Target to provide for fixed royalty rates for Target's sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made by Target through its website (target.com) and for sales by Target of Cherokee branded products in the category of school uniforms.
844161_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	In addition, in September 2012 we assumed a separate multi-year license agreement with Target in connection with our acquisition of the Liz Lange brands, pursuant to which Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of its products bearing such brands in the U.S.
844161_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Commencing with Fiscal 2014, the minimum annual royalty amount applicable to our restated license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand is $10.5 million, which applies to all sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. and Canada other than school uniforms, which are subject to a separate minimum annual royalty of $0.8 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	In Fiscal 2014, Target reached the guaranteed minimum yearly royalty amount of $10.5 million in the three month period ended November 2, 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Because we do not have direct oversight over Target, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given future period.
844161_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved for Cherokee branded products in various categories in the U.S., we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and fourth quarter to be our lowest quarter.
844161_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $15.3 million in Fiscal 2014 and $15.0 million in Fiscal 2013, which accounted for 53%, and 57%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The revenues generated from all other licensing agreements during Fiscal 2014 were $13.3 million and during Fiscal 2013 were $11.5 million, which accounted for 47% and 43%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods.
844161_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Target's U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 totaled $317.2 million compared to $344.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, decreasing approximately 7.9%.
844161_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 and $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013, decreasing approximately 15%.
844161_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	We attribute the decrease in retail sales in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 at Target largely due to the effects of Target's security breach, which occurred during the holidays and is believed to have deterred certain consumers from shopping at Target.
844161_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	Overall, Target's U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during Fiscal 2014 were slightly higher than Fiscal 2013 and as a result, our royalty revenues from Target for Fiscal 2014 were higher than the royalty revenues reported in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Zellers' retail sales in Canada of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand were $0 during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 compared to $16.0 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	For Fiscal 2014, Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise in Canada totaled $3.0 million, as compared to $101.6 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	The decrease in Zellers' retail sales of Cherokee branded products is attributed to store closings.
844161_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	Revenues from Zellers totaled $0.1 million for Fiscal 2014 and $2.1 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	Beginning in February 2013, the selling of Cherokee branded products in Canada has transitioned from Zellers to Target due to Zellers store closing.
844161_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	In January 2015, Target announced its decision to discontinue its operations in Canada.
844161_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Tesco's retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand, which for Fiscal 2014 included the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Turkey, totaled $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, compared to $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	For Fiscal 2014, Tesco's retail sales of Cherokee branded merchandise totaled $20.2 million, compared to $15.5 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	We believe the increase in Tesco's retail sales is due to Tesco's re-launch of the Cherokee brand in March 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 and $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P66_S4	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Tesco were $0.8 million for Fiscal 2014 and $0.7 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P66_S5	We terminated our license agreement with Tesco as of January 31, 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2014 increased to $7.3 million from $6.0 million in Fiscal 2013, representing a 21% increase.
844161_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	This total includes licensees for Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India, and other territories.
844161_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	All of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against such licensee's foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail information regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, including amortization of trademarks, were $18.6 million for Fiscal 2014, compared to $15.5 million for Fiscal 2013, representing an increase of $3.1 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Included in Fiscal 2014 are approximately $1.0 million of expenses related to professional services for the acquisition of Hawk and Tony Hawk, and approximately $1.0 million of professional and consulting fees related to the identification and remediation of weaknesses in internal control identified in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for Fiscal 2013 (our "Fiscal 2013 Annual Report"), which did not recur.
844161_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	These increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing and travel expenses.
844161_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	Other increases were primarily related to personnel costs required to further maximize the 360 degree licensing model, including the launch of Cherokee branded adult products at Target dotcom and the expansion of our brand portfolio into new territories, partially offset by decreases in marketing and travel expenses.
844161_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2014 was $0.02 million, as compared to $0.02 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2014 was $0.5 million compared to $0.2 million for Fiscal 2013 due to the full year of interest expense for the debt associated with the acquisition of the Liz Lange and Cherokee Uniform brands.
844161_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	For Fiscal 2014, we recorded a tax provision of $3.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Our effective tax rate was 36% for Fiscal 2014 and 37% for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2014 was $6.1 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of $6.8 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	On January 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.6 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	On February 1, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	On February 2, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	During Fiscal 2015, cash provided by operations was $10.4 million, compared to $8.6 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	We attribute this increase of $1.8 million in part to an increase of $3.7 million in net income.
844161_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 include: (i) a decrease in accounts payable of $0.5 million in Fiscal 2015, compared to an increase in accounts payable of $0.6 million in Fiscal 2014, which we attribute primarily to acquisition related expenses incurred in Fiscal 2014; (ii) an increase in tax receivable and payable of $0.8 million in Fiscal 2015, compared to a decrease of $0.6 million in Fiscal 2014; and (iii) stock-based compensation expense, including a tax effect, of $1.4 million in Fiscal 2015, compared to $0.8 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	During Fiscal 2014, cash provided by operations was $8.6 million, compared to $9.8 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	We attribute this decrease of $1.2 million in part to a decrease of $0.8 million in net income.
844161_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	The other primary differences in cash provided by operations between Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 include: (i) an increase in accounts payable of $0.6 million in Fiscal 2014, compared to an increase in accounts payable of $0.4 million in Fiscal 2013, which we attribute primarily to acquisition related expenses in Fiscal 2014; (ii) an increase in accounts receivable of $0.9 million in Fiscal 2014, compared to a decrease of $0.2 million in Fiscal 2013, which we attribute primarily to royalty revenue due for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands; and (iii) stock based compensation expense, including a tax effect, of $0.8 million in Fiscal 2014, compared to $1.0 million in Fiscal 2013, which we attribute primarily to a tax shortfall from stock-based compensation in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	During Fiscal 2015, cash used by investing activities was $0.6 million, compared to $19.7 million in Fiscal 2014 and $18.5 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	In Fiscal 2015, cash used by investing activities consisted of capital expenditures on property and equipment and trademark registration and renewal costs.
844161_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	In Fiscal 2014, cash used by investing activities was comprised of $0.6 million of capital expenditures on office equipment and $19.1 million for our purchase of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands and trademark registration and renewal fees for the Cherokee, Liz Lange, Sideout and Carole Little brands.
844161_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	In Fiscal 2013, cash used by investing activities was comprised of $0.5 million of capital expenditures on office equipment and $18.0 million for our purchase of the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, our acquisition of rights to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category and trademark registration and renewal fees for the Cherokee, Sideout and Carole Little brands.
844161_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	During Fiscal 2015, cash used in financing activities was $5.8 million, compared to cash received from financing activities of $12.3 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	We had loan payments of $7.0 million in Fiscal 2015, compared to net borrowings of $15.7 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Proceeds from exercises of stock options were $1.9 million in Fiscal 2015, compared to $0.04 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	During Fiscal 2015, our Board of Directors declared and paid a total of $0.8 million in dividends, compared to $3.4 million in dividends paid in Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	During Fiscal 2014, cash received from financing activities was $12.3 million, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.7 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	We had net borrowings of $15.7 million in Fiscal 2014, compared to $9.6 million in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	During Fiscal 2014, our Board of Directors declared and paid a total of $3.4 million in dividends, compared to $5.9 million in dividends paid in Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	On September 4, 2012, and in connection with our acquisition of the Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, we entered into a credit facility with JPMorgan Chase ("JPMorgan"), which was amended on January 31, 2013 in connection with our acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category and on January 10, 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	As of January 31, 2015, our borrowings under the credit facility totaled (i) approximately $9.7 million outstanding under a five-year term note issued in 2013 in principal amount of $16.6 million, (ii) approximately $15.5 million outstanding under a five-year term note issued in 2014 in principal amount of $19.0 million, and (iii) no amounts outstanding under a three-year revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $2.0 million.
844161_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The terms of the credit facility include various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain JPMorgan's consent before we can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) consummate acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans or programs, or (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders.
844161_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	The credit facility also imposes financial covenants that set financial standards we must maintain.
844161_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	Further, as collateral for the credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries.
844161_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Our cash requirements through the end of Fiscal 2015 are primarily to fund our operations and working capital, to make payments of principal and interest under our credit facility with JPMorgan, at our discretion and subject to the terms of the credit facility, to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our Board of Directors, and, to a lesser extent, to fund capital expenditures.
844161_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock are subject to negative covenants contained in our credit facility and, assuming the satisfaction or waiver by JPMorgan of such covenants, would be made solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors and would be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	Additionally, should an established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider using our liquidity to fund such an acquisition opportunity.
844161_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of January 31, 2015:
844161_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captioned "Fiscal 2016" starts on February 1, 2015 and ends on January 30, 2016.
844161_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	(b) Represents future minimum non-cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facilities in Sherman Oaks, California, Huntington Beach, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota and our equipment leases for the Sherman Oaks and Minneapolis office facilities.
844161_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	The lease for our Sherman Oaks office facility is set to expire on November 1, 2016, subject to our option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term.
844161_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The lease for our Minneapolis office facilities is set to expire on June 30, 2018, subject to our option to extend the lease for an additional three-year term.
844161_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	The lease for our Huntington Beach office facilities is set to expire on August 14, 2019, subject to our option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term.
844161_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	(c) Represents future interest (based on current interest rate) and principal payments with respect to our credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents currently on hand, and funds made available to us pursuant to the revolving line of credit issued by JPMorgan.
844161_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and access to funds pursuant to the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other commitments and otherwise support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flow that will be generated from operations in future periods, and our revenues and cash flows could be materially lower than we expect.
844161_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	If our revenues and cash flows are lower than we anticipate, or if our expenses are higher than we anticipate, then we may not have sufficient cash available to fund our planned operations and we could fall out of compliance with the terms of our credit facility or our other contractual commitments.
844161_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	In that case, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities.
844161_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of January 31, 2015, we were not the guarantor of any material third-party obligations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	As of January 31, 2015, we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
844161_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	The rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a material effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Since most of our future revenues will be based upon a percentage of sales by our licensees of products bearing our owned or represented trademarks, we do not anticipate that short-term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest-bearing temporary investments of high-quality issuers.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In relation to our credit facility with JPMorgan, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have had an immaterial impact on interest expense for Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in countries in which our licensees do business when they are converted to the U.S. dollar, and significant fluctuations in exchange rates could materially impact our results of operations and cash flow.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For Fiscal 2015, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 31% of our consolidated revenues.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For Fiscal 2015, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where our licensees operate would have negatively affected our revenues by approximately $1.1 million, which represents 3% of our total revenues reported for Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flow.
844161_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2015.
844161_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
844161_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
844161_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
844161_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Cherokee "or the "Company") is in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Cherokee Uniform, Sideout, Carole Little and le by alessandra brands and related trademarks and other brands it owns or represents.
844161_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	Cherokee is one of the leading licensors of style-focused lifestyle brand names and trademarks for apparel, footwear and accessories.
844161_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
844161_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
844161_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated during the consolidation process.
844161_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	The Company's fiscal year comprises a 52- or 53 -week period ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31.
844161_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	The fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 ("Fiscal 2015"), February 1, 2014 ("Fiscal 2014"), and February 1, 2013 ("Fiscal 2013") represent a 52-week period, a 52-week period and a 53-week period, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Receivables are reported at amounts the Company expects to be collected, net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
844161_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, such as: historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company's licensees, current economic conditions, bankruptcy, and other factors that may affect the licensees' ability to pay.
844161_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	There was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of January 31, 2015 or February 1, 2014.
844161_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance relating to revenue from contracts with customers that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
844161_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
844161_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company's financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern and requires additional disclosures if certain criteria are met.
844161_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2016.
844161_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
844161_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
844161_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company's consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	The Company has reclassified certain prior year amounts within the stock-based compensation on the Company's consolidated statements of stockholder's equity, and within the operating activities on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows and within the selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of income, to conform to the Company's current year presentation.
844161_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, stock based compensation and income taxes.
844161_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
844161_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_15_ITEM8_P20_S4	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased and money market funds purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
844161_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	At January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, the Company's cash and cash equivalents exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") limits.
844161_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer's price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
844161_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from the Company's licensees.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company's royalty revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Company's agreement with Target Corporation ("Target") for the Cherokee brand in the U.S. accounts for the majority of the Company's historical revenues and is structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved by Target.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	With respect to Target's sales in the U.S. of Cherokee branded products other than in the school uniforms category and adult products sold on Target's website, revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data after defined sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S4	As a result, the Company's royalty revenues as a percentage of Target's retail sales in the U.S. are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease during the fiscal year as Target exceeds sales thresholds as set forth in the Company's agreement with Target.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S5	The amount of Cherokee brand royalty revenue earned by the Company from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target's retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target's cumulative level of retail sales for Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S6	Historically, with Target, this has caused the Company's first quarter to be the Company's highest revenue and profitability quarter and the Company's fourth quarter to be the Company's lowest quarter.
844161_15_ITEM8_P23_S7	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future, depending upon the terms of any new license agreements, retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter from Target and revenues the Company receives from Target or other licensees that may or may not be subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, including with respect to the Company's Liz Lange and Completely Me by Liz Lange brands, Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category, Cherokee adult products sold on Target's website, and the recently acquired Hawk and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	In order to ensure that Cherokee's licensees are appropriately reporting and calculating royalties owed to Cherokee, all of Cherokee's license agreements include audit rights to allow Cherokee to validate the amount of the royalties paid.
844161_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	Any revenue resulting from these audits, or other audits, is recognized in the financial statement of the current reporting period.
844161_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Licensing revenue is recognized gross of withholding taxes that are remitted by the Company's licensees directly to their local tax authorities.
844161_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Revenues from arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received or billable by the Company in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of the Company, are deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Deferred revenues also represent minimum licensee revenue royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non-refundable to the licensee.
844161_15_ITEM8_P26_S2	Deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Deferred financing costs and debt discounts are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the life of the debt.
844161_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Property and equipment consist of the following:
844161_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
844161_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
844161_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or retired are written off, and the resulting gains or losses are included in current operations.
844161_15_ITEM8_P29_S3	Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.
844161_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Computers and related equipment and software are depreciated over three years.
844161_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Furniture and store fixtures are depreciated over the shorter of seven years, or the term of the corresponding license agreement.
844161_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of five years, or the life of the lease term.
844161_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	Depreciation expense was $571, $352 and $203 for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014, and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company holds various trademarks including Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz , and others, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in a number of other countries.
844161_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	The Company also holds trademark applications for Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Sideout Sport, Carole Little, Chorus Line, Saint Tropez-West, All That Jazz, and others in numerous countries.
844161_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	The Company intends to renew these registrations, as appropriate, prior to expiration.
844161_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company monitors on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of the Company's trademarks, and relies primarily upon a combination of trademark, copyright, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect the Company's intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Trademark registration and renewal fees are capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
844161_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	Trademark acquisitions are capitalized and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or are capitalized as indefinite-lived assets, if no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit its useful life to Cherokee.
844161_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment, at least annually.
844161_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
844161_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
844161_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
844161_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Long-term debt approximates fair value due to the variable rate nature of the debt.
844161_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The realizability of long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount.
844161_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Long-lived assets that will no longer be used in business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the Company.
844161_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Periodically, long-lived assets that will continue to be used by the Company need to be evaluated for recoverability.
844161_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections.
844161_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	The estimated undiscounted cash flows used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement are considered a Level 3 input, which consist of unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
844161_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	These inputs would be based on the best information available, including the Company's own data.
844161_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_15_ITEM8_P39_S3	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
844161_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.
844161_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
844161_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Cherokee limits credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with quality financial institutions.
844161_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	At fiscal year-end January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, the Company's cash and cash equivalents exceeded FDIC limits.
844161_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are minimal due to the limited amount of open receivables and due to the nature of the Company's licensing royalty revenue program.
844161_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support licensee receivables.
844161_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	One licensee, Target, accounted for approximately 48% and 53%, respectively, of trade receivables at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 and approximately 53%, 66% and 60%, respectively, of revenues during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	Another licensee, Kohl's, accounted for approximately 18% of trade receivables as January 31, 2015 and approximately 14% of revenues during Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	The current terms of the Company's relationship with Target are set forth in a restated license agreement with Target, which was entered into effective as of February 1, 2008 and recently amended (i) on January 31, 2013 to add the category of school uniforms, (ii) on April 3, 2013 to provide for a fixed royalty rate of 2% for sales of Cherokee-branded products in the category of adult merchandise sold on Target's website (target.com) in Fiscal 2015 and in future periods and (iii) on January 6, 2014 to reflect Target's election to renew the agreement through January 31, 2017 and to provide that Target can renew the agreement for successive two (2) year periods, provided that it satisfies the minimum guaranteed royalty payment of $10,500 for the preceding fiscal year (the "Restated Target Agreement").
844161_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Restated Target Agreement grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in various specified categories of merchandise.
844161_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	In addition, pursuant to a Canada Affiliate Agreement between Cherokee and Target Canada Co., dated December 1, 2011 (the "Target Canada Agreement"), the terms of the Restated Target Agreement apply to the territory of Canada effective as of February 1, 2013.
844161_15_ITEM8_P43_S3	In January 2015, Target announced its decision to discontinue operations in Canada.
844161_15_ITEM8_P43_S4	The current term of the Restated Target Agreement continues through January 31, 2017; however, the Restated Target Agreement may be renewed by Target for additional two year terms by providing written notice of renewal at least one year prior to the end of the then current extended restated term.
844161_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Effective as of February 1, 2013, the minimum annual guaranteed royalty for Target increased from $9,000 to $10,500 and applies to all sales made by Target in the United States and, until January 2015, in Canada, other than sales of Cherokee-branded products in the school uniforms category (which products are subject to a separate minimum guaranteed royalty of $800).
844161_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	Under the Restated Target Agreement, Target has agreed to pay royalties based on a percentage of Target's net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year ended January 31, which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise other than for sales of Cherokee-branded products in the school uniforms category and, beginning in Fiscal 2015, other than for sales of Cherokee-branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made on Target's website.
844161_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company assumed a separate license agreement with Target for the Liz Lange brand in connection with the Company's acquisition of the assets in September 2012.
844161_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	In connection with the Hawk acquisition, Cherokee and Kohl's entered into an amended license agreement.
844161_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Pursuant to such amendment, Kohl's is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States and has agreed to pay Cherokee an annual royalty rate for its sales of Hawk-branded signature apparel and related products in the United States subject to a minimum annual guaranteed royalty of $4,800 for four years.
844161_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Generally, the Company's "Direct to Retail" licensees fund their own advertising programs.
844161_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Cherokee's marketing, advertising and promotional costs were approximately $956, $700 and $1,500 during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	These costs are expensed as incurred and were accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses.
844161_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company provides marketing expense money to certain large licensees based upon sales criteria to help them build the Company's licensed brands in their respective territories, thus providing an identifiable benefit to Cherokee; the amounts paid for such marketing expenses during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 were approximately $222, $70 and $600, respectively, and are included in the Company's total marketing, advertising and promotional costs.
844161_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
844161_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	Diluted EPS is similar to the computation for basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
844161_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	However, nonvested restricted stock awards (referred to as participating securities) are excluded from the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding in accordance with authoritative guidance under the two-class method, since the nonvested restricted stockholders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock as if the shares were fully vested and hence are deemed to be participating securities.
844161_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to nonvested restricted stockholders are excluded from net earnings attributable to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share.
844161_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Shares of nonvested restricted stock have no material impact on the calculation under the two-class method.
844161_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Authoritative guidance establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets).
844161_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	For Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, the Company has no comprehensive income components and accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income.
844161_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Repurchased shares of the Company's common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired.
844161_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	When the Company reissues treasury stock, and the proceeds from the sale exceed the average price that was paid by the Company to acquire the shares, the Company records such excess as an increase in additional paid-in capital.
844161_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price the Company paid to acquire the shares, the Company records such difference as a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded, with the balance recorded as a decrease in retained earnings.
844161_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	When a lease includes lease incentives (such as a rent abatement) or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and amounts payable under the lease is included in deferred rent and lease incentives in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
844161_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	For leasehold allowances, the Company records a deferred lease credit on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred lease credit as a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of income over the term of the lease.
844161_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	On January 10, 2014, Cherokee entered into an asset purchase agreement with Quiksilver, Inc. and Hawk Designs, Inc., pursuant to which Cherokee acquired various assets related to the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" signature apparel brands and related trademarks.
844161_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The acquisition was treated as a business combination accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
844161_15_ITEM8_P55_S2	As consideration for the acquisition, Cherokee paid a cash purchase price equal to $19,000.
844161_15_ITEM8_P55_S3	These trademarks have been treated as indefinite-lived and no amortization has been recorded.
844161_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment, at least annually.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	On September 4, 2012, Cherokee and LLM Management Co., LLC entered into an asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which Cherokee acquired various assets related to the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The acquisition was treated as a business combination.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	As consideration for the acquisition, Cherokee agreed to pay a cash purchase price equal to $13,100.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S3	In addition, Cherokee agreed to pay additional earn-out payments totaling up to $900, which consideration was payable upon the Company's satisfaction of certain revenues attributable to the acquired assets during Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S4	The full amount of the earn-out payment had been paid as of the end of Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S5	In addition, as part of the acquisition, Cherokee agreed to assume the seller's obligations under various agreements, which included a consulting agreement with Ms. Lange as well as certain existing license agreements relating to the assets.
844161_15_ITEM8_P57_S6	The purchase price was allocated to trademarks and has been treated as indefinite-lived and no amortization has been recorded.
844161_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment, at least annually.
844161_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	On January 31, 2013, Cherokee and Strategic Partners, Inc. entered into an asset purchase agreement under which Cherokee acquired various rights relating to the Cherokee brand in the category of school uniforms in exchange for a cash payment of $4,250.
844161_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The acquisition was treated as a business combination.
844161_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	Cherokee had previously sold such assets to the seller in July 1995.
844161_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	The purchase price was allocated to trademarks and has been treated as indefinite-lived and no amortization has been recorded.
844161_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment, at least annually.
844161_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Amortization expense of trademarks was $932, $995, and $1,491 for each of Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014, and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Expected amortization of trademarks for fiscal years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 is approximately $800, $800, $500, $200, and $100, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Certain acquired trademarks are indefinite lived and not amortized.
844161_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	The weighted average amortization period for other trademarks was 9.4 years as of January 31, 2015.

844161_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	A summary of deferred income tax assets is as follows:
844161_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Foreign taxes include withholding required on royalty payments from foreign jurisdictions.
844161_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Deferred tax assets primarily relate to state tax benefits, and stock-based compensation.
844161_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based upon expected future income.
844161_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 in comparison to Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon the conclusion of income tax examinations during Fiscal 2015.
844161_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	The amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $450 and $1,000, respectively, at January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014.
844161_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	At January 31, 2015, approximately $290 of unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate.
844161_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Company has unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to the issue of its taxability in various state tax jurisdictions.
844161_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next 12 months as a result of the Company's interaction with these various state tax jurisdictions.
844161_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	The Company anticipates that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the next 12 months by approximately $450.
844161_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
844161_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	In accordance with authoritative guidance, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income.
844161_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the consolidated statements of income for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively, was $(260), $60 and $100.
844161_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	As of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, the total amount of accrued interest and penalties included in the Company's liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $80 and $300, respectively.

844161_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	For federal income tax purposes, the Fiscal 2012 and later tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three year statute of limitations.
844161_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	For state tax purposes, the Fiscal 2011 and later tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four year statute of limitations.
844161_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per-share computations for each of the past three fiscal years:
844161_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	The computation for diluted number of shares excludes unexercised stock options which are anti-dilutive.
844161_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	There were 0.8 million, 1.0 million and 0.8 million of anti-dilutive shares for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015, February 1, 2014 and February 2, 2013, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Cherokee leases office space in Sherman Oaks, California, Huntington Beach, California, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, which leases expire November 2016, subject to an option to extend for five years, August 2019, subject to an option to extend for five years, and June 2018, subject to an option to extend for three years, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	The Company also leases office equipment for certain of these locations.
844161_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	The future minimum non-cancelable lease payments are as follows:
844161_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	Total rent expense was $387 for Fiscal 2015, $323 for Fiscal 2014 and $290 for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	Total operating lease expenses, excluding rent, was $84 for Fiscal 2015, $120 for Fiscal 2014 and $102 for Fiscal 2013.
844161_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Cherokee indemnifies certain customers against liability arising from third-party claims of intellectual property rights infringement related to the Company's trademarks.
844161_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	These indemnities appear in the licensing agreements with the Company's customers, are not limited in amount or duration and generally survive the expiration of the contracts.
844161_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	Given that the amount of any potential liabilities related to such indemnities cannot be determined until an infringement claim has been made, the Company is unable to determine a range of estimated losses that it could incur related to such indemnifications.
844161_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
844161_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected probable favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim.
844161_15_ITEM8_P79_S2	As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate.
844161_15_ITEM8_P79_S3	As new claims arise or existing claims evolve, such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position.
844161_15_ITEM8_P79_S4	The Company may also be involved in various other claims and other matters incidental to the Company's business, the resolution of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

844161_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	On August 1, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $421, or $0.05 per share, which was paid on September 15, 2014 to stockholders of record as of September 1, 2014.
844161_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	Effective July 16, 2013, the Company's stockholders approved the 2013 Stock Incentive Award Plan (the "2013 Plan").
844161_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The 2013 Plan serves as the successor to the 2006 Incentive Award Plan (which includes the 2003 Incentive Award Plan as amended by the adoption of the 2006 Incentive Award Plan) (the "2006 Plan").
844161_15_ITEM8_P83_S2	The 2013 Plan authorized to be issued 700,000 additional shares of common stock, and (ii) 102,483 shares of common stock previously reserved but unissued under the 2006 Plan.
844161_15_ITEM8_P83_S3	No future grants will be awarded under the 2006 Plan, but outstanding awards previously granted under the 2006 Plan continue to be governed by its terms.
844161_15_ITEM8_P83_S4	Any such shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding awards under the 2006 Plan which are forfeited, terminate or expire unexercised and would otherwise have been returned to the share reserve under the 2006 Plan will be available for issuance as common stock under the 2013 Plan.
844161_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	The 2013 Plan provides for the issuance of equity-based awards to officers, other employees, and directors.
844161_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	Stock options issued to employees are granted at the market price on the date of grant, generally vest over a three-year period, and generally expire seven to ten years from the date of grant.
844161_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options.
844161_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Company has also granted non-plan options to certain executives as a material inducement for employment.
844161_15_ITEM8_P85_S3	The Company accounts for stock options under authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
844161_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
844161_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in the consolidated statements of income.
844161_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures over the award's service period.
844161_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Stock-based compensation expense recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses for stock options in Fiscal 2015 was approximately $800, for Fiscal 2014 was approximately $900, and for Fiscal 2013 was approximately $1,000.
844161_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The estimated fair value of options granted during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 as of each grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
844161_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
844161_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock price.
844161_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term.
844161_15_ITEM8_P90_S2	The dividend yield is based on the past dividends paid and the current dividend yield at the time of grant.
844161_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	A summary of activity for the Company's stock options as of and for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 is as follows:
844161_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the plans for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 was $3.49, $4.09, and $3.23, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing stock price on January 31, 2015 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on January 31, 2015 (the last trading day of Fiscal 2015).
844161_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock.
844161_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	The total intrinsic value of options exercised for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 was $411, $6 and $8, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	As of January 31, 2015, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $1,100, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.68 years.
844161_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The total fair value of all options which vested during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 was approximately $700, $800, and $1,100, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	In 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors granted certain performance-based equity awards to executives under the plans.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	The performance metric applicable to such awards is compound stock price growth, using the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2013, or $13.95, as the benchmark.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	The target growth rate is 10% annually, which results in an average share price target of (i) $15.35 for Fiscal 2014, (ii) $16.88 for Fiscal 2015 and (iii) $18.57 for the Company's fiscal year ending in 2016.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	The average share price will be calculated as the average of all market closing prices during the January preceding the fiscal year end.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S3	If a target is met at the end of a fiscal year, one third of the shares subject to the award will vest.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S4	If the stock price target is not met, the relevant portion of the shares subject to the award will not vest but will roll over to the following fiscal year.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S5	The executive must continue to be employed by the Company through the relevant vesting dates to be eligible for vesting.
844161_15_ITEM8_P96_S6	The target average share price was met for Fiscal 2015, which resulted in the vesting of two-thirds of the shares subject to each award.
844161_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	Since the vesting of these performance-based equity awards is subject to performance conditions, the fair value of these awards was measured on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model for each vesting tranche.
844161_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair market value for the performance units granted.
844161_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions and the resulting fair value of the award.
844161_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	In August 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors granted a sales-based performance-based equity award to an employee under the 2013 Plan, which vests in five increments dependent upon achievement of certain annual sales targets.
844161_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	The fair value of this award was measured on the effective date of grant using the price of the Company's common stock.
844161_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	Pursuant to a compensation program for non-employee directors adopted by the Compensation Committee, at the meeting of the Board of Directors held in June each year each non-employee member of the Board of Directors must make an election regarding the percentage, up to 100%, of his annual compensation for service on the Board of Directors to be paid in equity, in the form of restricted stock units ("RSU's").
844161_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	All of the RSU's issuable under this program in June 2014 were approved and granted on July 28, 2014.
844161_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	The fair value of these awards was measured on the effective date of grant using the price of the Company's common stock.
844161_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	The RSU's awarded to the non-employee directors are subject to the terms of the 2013 Plan and RSU agreements that provide for quarterly vesting over a one-year service period of August 4, 2014 through August 3, 2015, subject to acceleration of vesting upon the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a change in control of the Company, (ii) the death of the recipient or (iii) the recipient's failure to be re-elected to the Board of Directors in any election in which the recipient stands for re-election.
844161_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for shares of restricted stock and performance stock units was approximately $400, $200 and $10 for Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013, respectively.
844161_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	The following table summarizes information about restricted stock and performance stock activity as of and for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2015:
844161_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	As of January 31, 2015, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and performance stock was approximately $600, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.69 years.

844161_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	On June 5, 2012, Cherokee prepaid all outstanding principal and interest on the amended loan agreement.
844161_15_ITEM8_P103_S3	As a result, Cherokee currently has no outstanding borrowings under the amended term loan agreement with U.S. Bank.
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	On September 4, 2012, and in connection with the acquisition of the "Liz Lange" and "Completely Me by Liz Lange" brands, Cherokee and JPMorgan Chase (or "JPMorgan") entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), which was amended on January 31, 2013 in connection with the Company's acquisition of rights related to the Cherokee brand in the school uniforms category and was further amended on January 10, 2014 in connection with the Company's acquisition of the "Hawk" and "Tony Hawk" brands (the "Hawk Acquisition").
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	Effective January 10, 2014, Cherokee and JPMorgan entered into amendments to each of (i) the Credit Agreement, (ii) the existing term note, which was originally issued by Cherokee in favor of JPMorgan as of September 4, 2012 and previously amended by the parties effective January 31, 2013 (as amended, the "2013 Term Note") and (iii) the line of credit note, which was issued by Cherokee in favor of JPMorgan as of September 4, 2012 (as amended, the "Revolver").
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S2	In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, JPMorgan issued to Cherokee a new term note (the "2014 Term Note" and, together with the foregoing amendments, the "Loan Agreement Amendments") in the principal sum equal to the purchase price in the Hawk Acquisition, or $19,000.
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S3	The 2014 Term Note bears interest equal to either: (i) an adjusted annual LIBOR rate reset monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly, plus 2.75% or 3.00% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio or (ii) JPMorgan's annual prime rate or such annual prime rate plus 0.25% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio, with a floor equal to the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.5%.
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S4	Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the definition of "senior funded debt ratio" requires that Cherokee not exceed a ratio equal to (i) 2.50 to 1.00 until the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2014, (ii) 2.25 to 1.00 from the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2015 until the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2016, and (iii) 2.00 to 1.00 thereafter.
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S5	Prior to the effectiveness of the January 2014 amendment to the Credit Agreement, such limitation on Cherokee's senior funded debt ratio was fixed at 2.00 to 1.00 for all periods.
844161_15_ITEM8_P104_S6	In addition, pursuant to the Loan Agreement Amendments, the interest rate that applies to the 2013 Term Note and to the Revolver was amended to equal either: (i) an adjusted annual LIBOR rate reset monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly, plus 2.25% or 2.5% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio or (ii) the Bank's annual prime rate or such annual prime rate plus 0.25% depending on the applicable senior funded debt ratio, with a floor equal to the 1 month LIBOR Rate plus 2.5%.
844161_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	Following the issuance of the 2014 Term Note, Cherokee's total borrowings under the Credit Agreement (collectively, the "Loan") is evidenced by (i) the 2013 Term Note, which was issued in the principal amount of $16,600 and is payable on a quarterly basis through August 2017 and of which $9,747 was outstanding as of January 31, 2015, (ii) the Revolver, which provides Cherokee with a revolving line of credit in the principal amount of $2,000, none of which is outstanding as of January 31, 2015 and (iii) the 2014 Term Loan, which was issued in the principal amount of $19,000 and is payable on a quarterly basis through November 2018 and of which approximately $15,517 is outstanding as of January 31, 2015.

844161_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	Consistent with the existing terms of the Credit Agreement, the Loan is secured by continuing security agreements, trademark security agreements and continuing guarantees executed by Cherokee and its subsidiaries, as applicable.
844161_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	In addition, the Credit Agreement includes various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of Cherokee's business, including covenants that require Cherokee to obtain JPMorgan's consent in certain circumstances before Cherokee can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) make acquisitions, mergers or consolidations in excess of $5,000 on an aggregate basis following the Hawk Acquisition, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to Cherokee's employee equity incentive plans or programs and (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to Cherokee's stockholders.

844161_15_ITEM8_P106_S3	Further, Cherokee has granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of Cherokee's assets (including trademarks) as collateral for the Loan.
844161_15_ITEM8_P106_S4	In the event of a default under the Credit Agreement, the Bank has the right to terminate its obligations under the Credit Agreement, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the Credit Agreement and exercise its other rights, including foreclosing on Cherokee's assets under the security agreements.
844161_15_ITEM8_P106_S5	As of January 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.
844161_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following table summarizes certain unaudited financial information by quarter for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014:
844161_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	Authoritative guidance requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments.
844161_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Company identifies reportable segments based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility.
844161_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	The Company operates in a single business segment, the marketing and licensing of brand names and trademarks for apparel, footwear and accessories.
844161_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	Cherokee's marketing and licensing activities extend to brands which the Company owns and to brands owned by others.
844161_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	Cherokee's operating activities relating to owned and represented brands are identical and are performed by a single group of marketing professionals.
844161_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	While Cherokee's principal operations are in the United States, the Company also derives royalty revenues from some of the Company's licensees that are located all around the world.

844161_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
844161_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

844161_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Over the past few decades, we believe that the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, as it generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering licensees the ability to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	This differentiation can also provide the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a premium over private label price points, which can result in increased profit margins, even after royalties have been paid to the licensor.
844161_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	The licensees generally directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating the licensor s exposure to inventory risk while allowing the licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Many of the world s largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands based on the DTR licensing model.
844161_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	Examples of retailers actively participating in the DTR licensing model include Target, Walmart, Carrefour, Kohl s and C A, among others.
844161_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our Direct to Retail licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that, for many retailers in various countries worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, footwear and accessories business, including product development, design, merchandising, sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers themselves, who not only command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with their end consumers.
844161_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	We believe that many of these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by directly designing, sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than by carrying only private label goods or by carrying only branded products obtained from third party vendors.
844161_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We also believe that enhanced profitability is achievable with our Direct to Retail strategy, which coupled with the substantial marketing costs to establish and maintain an in store brand, will continue to increase the desirability of our strategy to retailers.
844161_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our primary strategy is to capitalize on these trends by licensing our portfolio of brand names directly to retailers around the world, who, working in conjunction with us, develop merchandise for their stores, and to augment our current portfolio by acquiring additional brands that have high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a range of merchandise categories.
844161_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition to our DTR licensing model, we also license our brands to manufacturers and wholesalers based on wholesale arrangements who sell products bearing our brands.
844161_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Although our strategy has historically been focused on the DTR licensing model, this alternative model diversifies our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, including access to some customers and markets that we may not be able to reach based solely on a DTR licensing model.
844161_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Wholesale licensing generally involves licensing to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home products and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	We have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements, for the Cherokee brand, starting in Fiscal 2018.
844161_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Wholesale licensing gives us the opportunity to further expand the reaches of our brands into markets where a DTR model may not be the most effective approach.
844161_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	The wholesale licensee structure aligns with our strategic plan and is consistent with our zero-inventory, no-manufacturing-risk business model.
844161_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our franchise business involves licensing our Flip Flop Shops brand to third-party franchisees that operate retail stores under this brand name.
844161_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	In our franchising operations, we typically specify the products and services that will be offered by the franchisees and also provide them with an operating system and other operational support.
844161_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Shops franchise structure aligns with our strategic plan and is consistent with our zero-inventory, no-manufacturing-risk business model .
844161_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	As part of our growth plan for Flip Flop Shops, we intend to expand store inventory to include more Company-owned brands and expand the retail concept through a combination of new retail store locations, shop-in-shops and mobile commerce.

844161_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	This objective also involves expanding our types of partner relationship to include additional wholesale licensees and, with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops trademark and brand name, franchisees of this brand.
844161_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	In our efforts to expand our portfolio of licensee partners, we acquired a number of new licensees for our brands in a variety of territories in Fiscal 2016, some of which are described below.
844161_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	In April 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Sears Canada Inc.
844161_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	The agreement covers a wide range of Cherokee lifestyle products, including men s, women s and children s clothing, footwear and accessories, and is planned to launch in the spring of 2016.

844161_16_ITEM1_P54_S1	and boy s sizes 4-20, which is expected to launch in the fall of 2016.

844161_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	In April 2015, we entered into a new license agreement with Sears Canada covering Liz Lange maternity and sportswear, including expanded size ranges, to be sold in Sears Canada stores and online beginning in the spring of 2016.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our rights to receive royalties for sales of products bearing our brands are set forth in the terms of our license agreements with various retailers and wholesalers.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Generally, royalty rates for our DTR licenses vary as a percentage of the retailer s net sales of licensed products.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	For wholesale license agreements, royalty rates are calculated based upon fixed percentages of wholesale sales from the wholesaler to the retailer.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	For retail license agreement, in some cases, royalty rates are calculated based upon fixed percentages of retail product sales.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S4	In other cases, the royalty rates we receive may decrease depending on the retailer s annual sales of licensed products and the retailer s guaranteed annual sales of licensed products, which decreased royalty rate would not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the applicable fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S5	For instance, our arrangement with Target provides for, with respect to Cherokee branded products in certain product categories, royalty rate reductions once specified cumulative levels of sales of these products are achieved by Target during each fiscal year and, with respect to other product categories, fixed royalty rates that apply irrespective of sales volume.
844161_16_ITEM1_P57_S6	The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary depending on the terms of each licensing agreement.
844161_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	In many cases, we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum dollar amount of retail sales.
844161_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	These minimum guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	In the case of Target, its minimum royalty payment was $10.5 million for each of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	As of January 30, 2016, we had contractual rights to receive over $50 million forward facing minimum royalty revenues over the next six years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Our rights to such contractual minimums are primarily the result of our license agreement with Target for our Cherokee brand, which extends through January 2017, and our license agreement with Kohl s for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands, which extends through January 2018.
844161_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period that has been defined in the applicable license agreement.
844161_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	In order to ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license agreements grant us the right to audit our licensees retail sales data for our brands to validate the amount of the royalties paid.
844161_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	Franchisees who wish to operate Flip Flop Shops retail locations inside the United States enter into a franchise agreement with us that generally provides franchise rights for each location for an initial term of 10 years and typically includes a 10-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions as specified in the franchise agreement.
844161_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	The agreements provide the franchisee the rights to use the Flip Flop Shops brand name, trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Flip Flop Shops retail store.
844161_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Franchisees typically pay us an initial franchise fee (historically $35,000 per store) and a royalty fee based on a percentage of gross sales at the retail store (historically 5%).
844161_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	In certain non-U.S. markets, we may grant a master franchisee exclusivity to develop or sub-franchise a territory for a specified number of new Flip Slop Shops locations in the territory based on a negotiated schedule.
844161_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	In these instances, the master franchisee pays an initial master franchise fee (typically $100,000 to $300,000 per master franchise), a per-location opening fee and a royalty fee based on a percentage of gross sales at the retail stores (historically 2.5%).
844161_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	Historically, the average per store sales have been approximately $300,000, with average net store openings per year of 15 stores.
844161_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	We have licensed our brands and the brands we represent to numerous different retailers and wholesalers.
844161_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Two of our most significant Direct to Retail licensees are Target and Kohl s.
844161_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	Pursuant to one of our license agreements with Target, Target maintains exclusive rights to the Cherokee brand in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S. Under our U.S. license arrangement with Target covering sales of all Cherokee branded products except sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada (which have now ceased as a result of Target discontinuing its operations in Canada), Cherokee branded adult products sold on Target s website and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, Target pays reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	These royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to Target s retail sales since the beginning of the year, but rather apply only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume.
844161_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	Our license arrangement with Target governing sales of Cherokee branded adult products sold on Target s website and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category provides for a fixed royalty rate based on Target s net sales of products during each fiscal quarter.
844161_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	In September 2015, Target informed us that it will not renew its license agreement covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in all categories after the end of its current term, which expires January 31, 2017 for most Cherokee branded products.
844161_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	This license agreement with Target, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues to Cherokee in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to Cherokee until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	During September 2012, we assumed an additional license agreement with Target covering sales of Liz Lange branded products in the U.S.
844161_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, Target is obligated to pay us a fixed royalty rate based on Target s net sales of products bearing this brand.
844161_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	This agreement is unaffected by the non-renewal of our other agreements with Target covering the Cherokee brand.
844161_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	Royalty revenues from Target U.S. for the Cherokee brand, which excludes sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, were $14.9 million during Fiscal 2016, $15.0 million during Fiscal 2015 and $15.3 million during Fiscal 2014, which accounted for 43%, 43%, and 53%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	The expiration of our license arrangements with Target for Cherokee branded products may have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	See Item 1A, Risk Factors .
844161_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	In connection with our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands in January 2014, Cherokee entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl s.
844161_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	Pursuant to this license agreement, Kohl s maintains exclusive rights to the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands in various specified categories of merchandise in the U.S.
844161_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	The current term of the license agreement with Kohl s continues through January 31, 2018, and obligates Kohl s to pay Cherokee an annual minimum royalty of $4.8 million.
844161_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	We have continuing international license agreements for the Cherokee brand and our other brands with leading retailers in over fifty countries.
844161_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	We license to retailers such as RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Argos, Nishimatsuya, Walmart Canada and Sears Canada.
844161_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	Additionally, subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2016, we entered into several new wholesale licensing arrangements covering sales of products bearing several of our brands within the United States, in order to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, including access to some customers and markets that we may not be able to reach based solely on a DTR licensing model.

844161_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees net sales of licensed products.
844161_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	Additionally, franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand pay us a percentage of their net sales.
844161_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Merchandise bearing our Cherokee, Carole Little, Sideout , Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk and Everyday California brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, as well as merchandise sold by Flip Flop Shops retail shops, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne , and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona , and Route 66.
844161_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	Factors that shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	In recognition of what we believe is an increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and what appears to be a de - emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise, our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers and, to a lesser extent, entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners and engaging wholesalers to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers .
844161_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees ability to sell products bearing our or third-party brands, and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to respond to ever - changing consumer demands.
844161_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	We also compete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers and wholesale manufacturers in the U.S. and internationally, including with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention , limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold and time and resources of wholesale licensees that manufacture our products .
844161_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	We have agreed to certain contractual royalty rate reductions with Target for sales of certain Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S. in each fiscal year, which apply for future sales during the applicable fiscal year as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved.
844161_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	Historically, this has caused us to record our highest revenues and profits in our first quarter and our lowest revenues and profits in our fourth quarter.
844161_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	However, such historical patterns and seasonal trends may vary significantly in future periods, depending upon retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter by Target, the revenues we receive that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, and the terms of any new license agreements.
844161_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Various state laws and the Federal Trade Commission regulate our Flip Flop Shops franchising activities.
844161_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	For instance, the Federal Trade Commission requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement, and several states require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offerings and sales.
844161_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
844161_16_ITEM1_P77_S3	We are also subject to various laws that are generally applicable to businesses in our industry, such as work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations.
844161_16_ITEM1_P77_S4	Our violation of any of these laws could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	As of January 30, 2016, we employed fifty one persons.
844161_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
844161_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to the Company s directors, officers, employees and manufacturers that produce products on behalf of our licensees.
844161_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.
844161_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	We consider our business activities to constitute a single segment.
844161_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	A summary of our revenues and assets by geographic area is set forth in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

844161_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The occurrence of any of the risks and uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report and the other documents we file with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and share price and could also cause our future business, financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from our historical results and the results contemplated by any forward-looking statements we may make herein, in any other document we file with the SEC, or in any press release or other written or oral statement we may make.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this Annual Report and the other documents we file with the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our common stock.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report are not the only ones we face.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our financial condition and business operations.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees net sales of licensed products.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Additionally, franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand pay us a percentage of their net sales.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	and retail licensees, as well as merchandise sold by Flip Flop Shops retail shops, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona, and Route 66.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Factors that shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In recognition of what we believe is an increasing trend toward consolidation of retailers, our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers and, to a lesser extent, entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners and engaging wholesalers to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees ability to sell products bearing our or third-party brands, and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to respond to ever - changing consumer demands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Failures with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We cannot control the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and changing preferences and trends may lead customers to purchase other products.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Further, we cannot control the level of resources that our licensees or franchisees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support products bearing other brands to the detriment of our brands because our agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing from selling products of, our competitors.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, we compete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers and wholesale manufacturers in the U.S. and internationally, including with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention , limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold and time and resources of wholesale licensees that manufacture our products.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees and franchisees.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	There are numerous risks and other factors applicable to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees and franchisees ) that can impact the sale of products that bear our brands and, with respect to our franchisees, the sale of products bearing other brands from which we generate revenues .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any decline in sales by one or more of our licensees or franchisees could adversely affect our revenues.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Factors that may adversely affect our licensees and franchisees and their sales of products include the following, among others: (i) weather, environmental or other conditions that may impact consumer shopping activity in retail stores; (ii) consumer preferences regarding fashion trends and styles, which can be region - dependent and subject to rapid and significant fluctuations; (iii) consumer preferences regarding where to shop; (iv) the growth of online shopping and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to market and sell products through these avenues; (v) changes in the availability or cost of capital in light of the financial condition and capital requirements of our licensees and franchisees ; (vi) shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; (vii) fluctuating retail prices; (viii) labor strikes or other interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors (ix) the impact of excess retail capacity; (x) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (xi) material acquisitions or dispositions; (xii) investments in new business strategies; (xiii) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xiv) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other governmental authorities and officials; (xv) security breaches; (xvi) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events; and (xvii) the other risks discussed in this Item 1A.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We rely on the accuracy of our licensees and franchisees retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenues could be delayed or inaccurately reported or collected.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Most of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands in their stores and on their websites .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, we have a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we have arrangements with several wholesalers who license our brands to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Under our existing agreements, these licensees and franchisees pay us fees based in part on the value of products sold.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	franchisees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license and franchise fees, preparing our financial reports, projections and budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	All of our license and franchise agreements permit us to audit our licensees and franchisees .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If any of our licensee or franchisee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled on a timely basis or at all , or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our business is dependent on the success of our Direct to Retail licensing model , as well as our other licensing and franchising models.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Although we recently commenced franchise operations with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we intend to grow this business in the future and we also recently entered into several new licensing arrangements with wholesalers and may seek to enter into additional wholesale arrangements in the future, we continue to be focused on our Direct to Retail licensees.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In many cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although we typically collaborate with our licensees product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to products bearing our trademarks.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Over the past two decades, the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, and our business plan is still based on the continued success of this model with our current licensees and with new retailers we may solicit to license our brands in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand our business.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Although we believe there is an increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers, which could support the growth of our Direct to Retail licensing model, this belief may turn out to be wrong.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If our current or potential future retail licensees do not perceive our Direct to Retail licensing model to be advantageous to them, then they may move away from this model and instead embrace alternatives, such as purchasing from wholesalers or manufacturing private label products.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Such a change in perception could occur for a variety of reasons, including reasons based on retailers beliefs or expectations that do not turn out to be accurate.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Further, even though our pursuits of wholesale and franchise models may diversify our sources of revenue in the event that our expectations regarding Direct to Retail licensing trends do not prove to be accurate, these pursuits could themselves be unsuccessful and could divert management s attention and other resources, including time and capital, from our Direct to Retail licensing strategy.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully manage these multiple licensing avenues.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If our Direct to Retail licensing model ceases to be attractive to retailers or we are unable to manage our wholesale and franchise arrangements together with our Direct to Retail licensing model , then we would be unable to continue to pursue our business plan and our financial condition and prospects would be harmed.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business is largely dependent on royalties from Target , which has notified us that it will not renew its current relationship with us for the Cherokee brand.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target accounted for greater than 40% of our consolidated revenues during each of Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In September 2015, Target informed us that it would not renew its license agreement covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S., which expires at the end of its current term on January 31, 2017 for most Cherokee branded products.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The license agreement with Target, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues to us in Fiscal 2017 until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to us until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If Target were to reduce its sales of Cherokee branded products prior to expiration of its license , even if Target continues to pay the minimum annual royalties required under the license agreement with Target , any increased revenues we may receive from other licensees or franchisees may not be sufficient to offset such a reduction in royalty revenues from Target .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Replacing the royalty payments received from Target is be a significant challenge , and we might not be successful in doing so .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	If we are not successful in replacing the Target royalty payments with equal or greater payments from other partners , the termination of this license agreement, which currently extends through January 31, 2017 could have an adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flow.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In addition, in September 2012 we expanded our relationship with Target when we assumed an additional license agreement with Target for the Liz Lange brand, which we do not expect to be affected by the non-renewal of our agreements with Target covering Cherokee branded products .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We acquired the Liz Lange brand in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for this brand would grow in future periods, although such revenue growth may never occur.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As a result of our reliance on Target at least through Fiscal 2017, our continued success is dependent on various factors affecting Target s business, including, for example, perceptions of Target by consumers in the United States.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	For example, we believe that sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the United States after the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 were adversely impacted following Target s announcement of unauthorized access to payment card data in U.S. stores.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Revenues from our Hawk and Tony Hawk brands depend on Kohl s.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In January 2014, we acquired the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Concurrently with this acquisition, we entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl s, pursuant to which Kohl s is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk - branded apparel and related products in the United States.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We agreed to this exclusive license in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Kohl s for these brands will grow in future periods, although this expectation may turn out to be wrong and such revenue growth may never occur beyond the $4.8 million minimum annual royalty payment required under the license agreement.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The failure of our licensees to sell products bearing our brands or our franchisees to sell products that generate royalties to us, to pay us royalties for such products or to renew their license or franchise agreements with us could result in a decline in our results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license and franchise agreements.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Although the license agreements for our brands in many cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees or franchisees to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, their decision to not renew their agreements with us or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Further, while we are substantially dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl s and expect to continue to be at least through Fiscal 2017 when our agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand will expire , the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees or franchisees to meet their financial obligations to us or to renew their respective license or franchise agreements could materially and adversely impact our results of operation and our financial condition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our franchise business exposes us to numerous risks.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of this brand.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Flop Shops retail stores located across the globe, including in the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Africa.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	This new Flip Flop Shops franchise business exposes us to a variety of risks, including, among others, that: (i) we may not be able to find capable and experienced franchisees who can implement the Flip Flop Shops brand concept and strategies we believe are necessary for the future growth of this brand or sell merchandise and operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, which could limit our revenues from this brand and diminish the image and reputation of this brand and our other brands; (ii) even if we are able to attract capable franchise owners, these franchisees may not be able to open new Flip Flop Shops retail stores in a timely manner, or manage and maintain them once opened, if they cannot secure desirable site locations, obtain adequate financing, construct and develop new store locations without delays and attract qualified operating personnel, which could slow the growth of this brand and reduce our franchise revenues; (iii) the third party brands that are sold at Flip Flop Shops stores could decline in popularity or decide to stop selling their merchandise at some or all of the Flip Flop Shops store locations, which could cause sales at these stores to decline; (iv) neighborhood or economic conditions or other demographic patterns where existing or new Flip Flop Shops stores are located could decline or otherwise change in a negative way, which could result in reduced sales by these store locations; and (v) our franchise business is subject to complex and varying franchise laws and regulations imposed by the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may need to devote significant costs and resources in order to learn and comply with these laws and regulations.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our wholesale licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In our wholesale licensing relationships, we license our brands to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home products and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In these arrangements, we have a limited ability to control the manufacturing process, access to raw materials, the timing for delivery of finished products, the quality of finished products or costs related to the manufacturing process.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Any wholesale licensees we engage may not be able to produce finished products in quantities that are sufficient to meet retailer demand, in a timely manner or at all, which could result in an inability to generate revenue from any such products and loss of retailer confidence in our brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	On the other hand, wholesale licensees may produce inventory in excess of retailer and consumer demand, in which case over-supply may cause retail prices of products bearing our products to decline.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Additionally, there may be delays in the manufacturing process over which we may have no control, including shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, backlogs or insufficient devotion of resources to the manufacture of products bearing our brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Further, we compete with other brand owners for the time and resources of our wholesale licensees, which could curtail or limit our ability to engage new or maintain existing wholesale licensee partners on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Interruptions in the supply of products bearing our brands to retailers or lapses in quality could adversely impact our financial condition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Further, the unplanned loss of any of our wholesale licensees could lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of products bearing our brands, create negative impressions of us and our brands with retailers and consumers and add downward pressure on prices of products bearing our brands as a result of liquidating a former wholesaler s inventory of such products.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and the corresponding impact on levels of consumer spending, which may affect our licensees and franchisees retail sales.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Further, the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Purchases of apparel, footwear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	As a result, during periods of economic uncertainty, slowdown or recession, the risks associated with our business are generally more acute .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	In addition to decreased consumer spending generally, these periods may be accompanied by decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown , a lengthy or severe recession or any other negative trend in either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with our international licensees and franchisees.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We franchise our Flip Flop Shops brand and market and license our other brands outside the United States.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Many of our licensees and franchisees are located outside the United States.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees and franchisees .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	During Fiscal 2016, approximately 30% of our revenues were derived from our international licensees.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers; (iii) difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to manage foreign licensees and franchisees ; (iv) competition from foreign companies; (v) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (vi) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property; (vii) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (viii) potentially adverse tax consequences; and ( ix ) cultural differences in the conduct of business.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Additionally, and because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees or franchisees operations may negatively impact our royalty revenues.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights or we may become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We hold various trademarks for our brands, including Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Everyday California, Flip Flop Shops, Sideout and Carole Little and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in numerous other countries and we also hold trademark applications for these brands in a number of other countries, although the laws of many countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	These actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not prevent imitation of our products, infringement of our intellectual property rights by unauthorized parties or other challenges to our intellectual property ownership, or prevent the loss of licensing or franchise revenue or other damages caused thereby.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	If any of these events occurs, our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and one or more parties may assert infringement claims against us.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We may become involved in other litigation and administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations, audits and proceedings.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Such matters can be time - consuming, divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any of these actions or legal costs associated with these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives and employees , including, Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board or Directors, Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer , and Brian Curin, the President of our subsidiary FFS Holdings, LLC, which manages our Flip Flop Shops franchise operations .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We have a limited number of employees and Mr. Stupp s and our other executives leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry and Mr. Curin s expertise in the franchising industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives or other employees .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other key executives or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may encounter difficulties in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from these transactions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	During the past three fiscal years, we have consummated three such acquisitions: our acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands in January 2014; our acquisition of the Everyday California Lifestyle brand in May 2015; and our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio of products and services or expand the breadth of our markets.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Our experience integrating acquired assets and businesses is limited, and we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio of brands, which could involve significantly increased costs and pose substantial challenges for management.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Acquisitions and other strategic transactions can involve numerous risks and potential difficulties, including, among others: (i) problems assimilating the brands; (ii) significant future charges relating the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) problems maintaining and enforcing standards, procedures, controls, policies and information systems; (iv) difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel, and failure to retain key employees of any acquired businesses; (v) unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition, including accounting and legal charges, capital expenditures, and transaction expenses; (vi) diversion of management s attention from our core business or our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships with our partners; and (viii) risks associated with entering new markets or new types of business arrangements in which we have no or limited prior experience , such as, for instance, our acquisition of franchise agreements and entry into the franchising business upon our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transactions that we pursue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	If we finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing debt, we may become over -leveraged and our ability to operate our business may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, we may experience or incur contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write - offs of goodwill or trademarks in connection with such transactions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any of these effects could harm our operating results or financial condition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our level of indebtedness, and restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We entered into a credit facility with JPMorgan in September 2012 and we increased the size of the credit facility in January 2013, January 2014 and October 2015, in each case in connection with our acquisition of new brands or new rights relating to existing brands.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Approximately $24 million in principal amount was outstanding under our credit facility as of January 30, 2016, and is evidenced by (i) three term notes, which were issued on January 31, 2013, January 10, 2014 and October 13, 2015 in the principal amounts of $16.6 million , $19 million and $6 million, respectively, and (ii) a revolving line of credit, pursuant to which we may borrow up to $2 million in principal.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	All of our outstanding indebtedness owed under the credit facility is due in March 2017.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our indebtedness under the credit facility could adversely affect our operations and liquidity, by, among other things: making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flow to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development and capital expenditures and other business activities; making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures , brand acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We may seek to refinance all or a portion of this indebtedness before its maturity date.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	In addition, the terms of our indebtedness contain various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain JPMorgan s consent before we can: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) consummate acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) issue any equity securities other than pursuant to our employee equity incentive plans or programs, or (iv) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The credit facility also imposes financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.2 to 1.0 and a limitation of our senior funded debt ratio to not exceed a ratio equal to 2.00 to 1.00.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Further, as collateral for the credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by Cherokee s wholly owned subsidiaries.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Target s election in September 2015 to not renew the license agreement for the Cherokee brand in the U.S. triggered an event of default under the credit facility.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P53_S1	However, we and JPMorgan entered into a forbearance agreement immediately after Target s non-renewal election and JPMorgan subsequently waived this event of default.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If an event of default occurs under the credit facility that is not forborne, cured or waived in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, JPMorgan has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit facility, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit facility and exercise any other rights it may have, including foreclosing on our assets under the related security agreements.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and liquidity.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available when needed , on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available when needed, on favorable terms, or at all.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders would experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders, and if we incur additional debt to raise funds, we may become over -leveraged and our ability to operate our business may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Moreover, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P55_S4	If we cannot raise funds when needed , on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P55_S5	This may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of products bearing our brands and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on these initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long - term, we may not be successful in doing so and such initiatives may not result in the intended benefits.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and delays or difficulties in upgrading existing systems , transitioning to new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity and other system failures.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our licensees and franchisees are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Although we have not experienced any such cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date, some of our licensees, including Target, have experienced such events in the past .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If such an event were to occur to our internal systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if possible, loss of or damage to our data or applications, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or the incurrence of other material liabilities.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	If such events were to occur to our licensees or franchisees systems, our royalty revenues could be reduced or disrupted due to decreased sales of our branded products as a result of reputational damage , diversion of costs and other resources from selling products bearing our brands or inability of our licensees or franchisees to calculate royalties or generate royalty reports .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Any of these events could severely harm our business, results of operations and prospects.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We are subject to income taxes in the United States, California and certain other state jurisdictions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Our effective income tax rates could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of tax laws, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S4	We may be audited by tax authorities, which could evaluate and disagree with our judgments regarding our tax provisions.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be expensive to defend and materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S6	The results of an audit or litigation could materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P63_S7	In addition, changes in tax rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Compliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards will increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Existing, changing and new laws, regulations, listing requirements and other standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure create uncertainty for public companies and significantly increase the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Our management team devotes significant time and financial resources to comply with existing and evolving standards for public companies.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated or proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including, for example, with respect to the preparation and filing of financial statements, establishment or disclosure of clawback and hedging policies and disclosure of executive compensation information.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The existence of new and proposed laws and regulations relating to our financial reporting or other disclosure obligations or that impose additional or more stringent compliance requirements could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors ( Board of Directors ), particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees, and qualified executive officers.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	In addition, in order to comply with existing and any new or additional requirements, we may need to add additional accounting staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices, standards and policies, which could significantly increase our costs and divert the time and attention of our management team away from revenue generating activities.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Notwithstanding our efforts, it is possible in future periods that our financial and other public reporting may not be considered timely, accurate or complete.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	our financial results, result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information and other public disclosures, and materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including (i) our financial results, (ii) announcements by us, our retail partners or our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, the reputation of our brands, our existing or new license agreements and brand representations or acquisitions , strategic alliances or other transactions, (iii) recruitment or departure of key personnel, (iv) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock, and (v) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Further, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our common stock than would be the case if our public float was larger.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The determination regarding the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and therefore we may not pay any dividends in future periods, whether or not we generate sufficient cash to do so.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P71_S1	In addition, pursuant to our credit facility with JPMorgan, we are prohibited from paying dividends without JPMorgan s consent and in the event that we would be in violation of our covenant regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio after giving effect to any proposed dividend or are otherwise then in default under such agreement.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, such as under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, upon expiration of any lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares or upon our issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or the vesting of restricted stock units, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Subject to the approval of JPMorgan pursuant to our credit facility, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	For instance, such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, could have superior voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or could have other terms that negatively impact the voting control or other rights of our common stockholders.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Additionally, the ownership interest of holders of our common stock would be diluted following the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Further, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if repeated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P77_S2	It is possible that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In this case, our consolidated financial statements may be more likely to contain material misstatements , in which case we could be required to restate our financial results .
844161_16_ITEM1A_P77_S4	Any such restatement of our financial results could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation and could cause our stock price to decline.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In addition, our current controls and procedures may not be adequate in future periods to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards, we may be unable to conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in ensuring the reliability of our financial reports.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, our business and financial condition could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.
844161_16_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Moreover, our reputation with lenders, retailers, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected.
844161_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease an 11,399 square foot office facility in Sherman Oaks, California, which serves as our corporate headquarters.
844161_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The current term of this lease ends on November 1, 2016, and we provided written notice of our election to renew the lease for an additional five-year term in February 2016.
844161_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our monthly base rent under this lease is currently $26,514.
844161_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	We also lease a 3,440 square foot office facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
844161_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	The current term of this lease ends on June 30, 2018 and our current monthly base rent under this lease is $3,870.
844161_16_ITEM2_P0_S5	Beginning in March 2016, we are no longer occupying our Minnesota office facilities and we entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of such facilities to a third party, pursuant to which we receive $1,804 in monthly rent.
844161_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	Both the Sherman Oaks and Minneapolis lease agreements include provisions allowing for early termination under certain conditions.
844161_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease a 2,032 square foot office facility in Huntington Beach, California.
844161_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	The current term of this lease ends on August 14, 2019, subject to our option to renew for an additional five year term.
844161_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	Our current monthly base rent under this lease is $2,642.
844161_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
844161_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that could harm our business.
844161_16_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we are a party or to which our property is subject that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol CHKE .
844161_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for each of the fiscal quarters during our last two fiscal years, the range of the high and low sale prices for our common stock and the cash dividends declared and paid per share, if any.
844161_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of April 8, 2016, the approximate number of stockholders of record of our common stock was 69.
844161_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	This figure does not include beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies, of which there is an indeterminable number.
844161_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare additional dividends depending upon Cherokee s financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements, compliance with our credit facility with JPMorgan and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information about the restrictions on dividends contained in our credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly traded licensing companies exists; hence, we compared the return on investment in our common stock to the S P 100 LTD and NASDAQ Composite Index.
844161_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	The table and the graph below compare the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing January 29, 2011 and ending on January 30, 2016.
844161_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	The data set forth below assumes the value of an investment in our common stock and each Index was $100 on January 29, 2011 and assumes the reinvestment of all dividends.
844161_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	The stock performance shown in the table and the graph below should not be considered indicative of future stock performance.
844161_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected consolidated financial information has been taken or derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.
844161_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .
844161_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on Form 10 K (the Annual Report ).
844161_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	In addition to historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based upon our current views, expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.
844161_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Actual results may differ substantially from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including, among others, the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
844161_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	As used in this discussion and analysis, Cherokee , the Company , we , us and our refer to Cherokee Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates or requires otherwise.
844161_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, as used herein, Fiscal 2016 refers to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016; Fiscal 2015 refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015; and Fiscal 2014 refers to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014.
844161_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns with our retail licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	Each of Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 was a 52 week fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods that may differ from ours.
844161_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year to year basis.
844161_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	We own the registered trademarks or trademark applications for Cherokee , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Hawk , Tony Hawk , Everyday California , Flip Flop Shops , Sideout , Sideout Sport , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz , and others.
844161_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	All other trademarks, trade names and service marks included in this discussion and analysis are the property of their respective owners.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Cherokee is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Hawk, Tony Hawk, Sideout, Carole Little, Everyday California, Flip Flop Shops and le by alessandra brands and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are one of the leading global licensors of style focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home products and accessories.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	As part of our business strategy, we frequently evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S3	We enter into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations to provide them the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to provide them our proprietary 360-degree platform.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S4	We refer to this strategy as our Direct to Retail or DTR licensing model.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S5	We believe our retail responsiveness process and 360-degree unique value proposition have allowed Cherokee to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of the retailers that are selling our portfolio of lifestyle brands.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S6	Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that we continually measure, evaluate and incorporate into our 360-degree platform, we believe Cherokee has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S7	As of January 30, 2016 , we had thirty-four continuing license agreements covering domestic and international markets, fifteen of which pertained to the Cherokee brand.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S8	We have also entered into wholesale arrangements for the manufacture and sale of products bearing certain of our brands.
844161_16_ITEM7_P5_S9	Further, in connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops trademark and related assets, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, franchise agreements with franchisees that operate Flip Flop Shops retail stores located worldwide.
844161_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are guided by three value pillars that speak to our diverse global partners, Vision, Agility, Scale:
844161_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Vision - Brand vision that will drive differentiation and a fresh point of view to engage customers across every touch point and in multiple categories.
844161_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Scale - The ability to fully leverage our brands physical and digital spaces with multi-category relevancy and with globally recognized brands that drive a seamless customer experience.
844161_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We derive revenues primarily from licensing our trademarks to retailers all over the world.
844161_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our current retail licensee relationships cover over fifty countries and over 9,000 retail stores and online businesses and include relationships with Target, Kohl s, RT Mart, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Argos, Nishimatsuya Walmart Canada and Sears Canada.
844161_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our two most significant licensees are Target and Kohl s.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Generally, royalty rates for our Direct to Retail license agreements vary as a percentage of the retailer s net sales of licensed products.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	In some cases, royalty rates are calculated based upon a fixed percentage of product sales.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	In other cases, including with Target, we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales of merchandise in certain product categories are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee s retail sales since the beginning of the year, but rather apply only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S4	For example, the amount of royalty revenue earned by us from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target s retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in that quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target s cumulative level of retail sales for certain Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S5	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees retail sales are typically highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease if and when certain retail sales thresholds are met.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S6	Historically, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_16_ITEM7_P10_S7	However, such historical patterns and seasonal trends may vary significantly in future periods, depending upon retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter by Target, the revenues we receive from Target and our other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, and the terms of any new license agreements.
844161_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The terms of our royalty arrangements vary for each of our licensees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	In most cases we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum royalty.
844161_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	These minimum royalty guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	In the case of Target, its minimum annual guaranteed royalty was $10.5 million for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, and in the case of Kohl s, its minimum annual guaranteed royalty was $4.8 million for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	As of January 30, 2016, we had contractual rights to receive over $50 million forward facing minimum royalty revenues over the next six years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our rights to such contractual minimums are primarily the result of our license agreement with Target for our Cherokee brand, which extends through January 2017, and our license agreement with Kohl s for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands, which extends through January 2018.
844161_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Additionally, pursuant to our typical franchise agreements, f ranchisees pay us a royalty fee based on a percentage of gross sales at each franchise retail location.
844161_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	However, our licensees and franchisees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period to period fluctuations in retail sales.
844161_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	As a result, and except as noted elsewhere in the comparisons of our three most recently completed fiscal years, we do not have sufficient information to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or mix of products sold by our licensees and franchisees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	See Item 1A, Risk Factors .
844161_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees operations may impact our royalty revenues.
844161_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Additionally, we generally record the sales of our international licensees and franchisees in U.S. dollars, and our disclosure related to the sales of such licensees and franchisees throughout this Annual Report is denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
844161_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	In arriving at such denominations, we receive a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our licensees and franchisees that is denominated in the applicable foreign currency.
844161_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	These amounts are then converted to U.S. dollars using the appropriate exchange rate for the purpose of disclosing all retail sales in U.S. dollars.
844161_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	For all periods presented in this Annual Report, we do not consider the period to period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on the accuracy of the U.S. dollar denominated figures presented in this Annual Report.
844161_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	On May 14, 2015, Cherokee completed an asset acquisition with Everyday California Holdings, LLC, under which it acquired various assets related to the Everyday California brand and related trademarks.
844161_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	As consideration for the acquired assets, Cherokee paid $1.0 million in cash upon the completion of the acquisition and agreed to pay up to an additional $0.3 million in cash dependent upon performance of the assets during Cherokee s fiscal years ending in 2017 and 2018.
844161_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	In September 2015, Target informed us that it would not renew the license agreement covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S., which expires at the end of its current term on January 31, 2017 for most Cherokee branded products.
844161_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The license agreement with Target, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues to Cherokee in Fiscal 2017 until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	Our agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to Cherokee until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Target s election in September 2015 to not renew the license agreement for the Cherokee brand in the U.S. triggered an event of default under the credit facility .
844161_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	However, we and JPMorgan entered into a forbearance agreement immediately after Target s non-renewal election and JPMorgan subsequently waived this event of default.
844161_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	On October 13, 2015, we completed a merger ( Merger ) pursuant to which we, through our subsidiaries, own all rights to the Flip Flop Shops trademark and brand name, which is a franchise retail chain dedicated to offering the hottest brands and latest styles of flip flops, casual footwear and accessories, and we became the franchisor for over 90 existing Flip Flop Shops franchise shops located in the U.S. Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Africa and over 100 additional retail shops in development worldwide.
844161_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Flip Flop Shops retail stores carry definitive assortments of recognized brands including OluKai, SANUK, Cobian, Havaianas, Quiksilver, ROXY, Reef, and many more.
844161_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	As consideration for the acquired assets, Cherokee paid $12.0 million in cash upon the completion of the acquisition, which is subject to certain adjustments and escrow arrangements.
844161_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	agreement to March 1, 2017 and (ii) issue a new term note to JPMorgan in exchange for the principal amount of the note of $6 million.
844161_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	As of January 30, 2016, our borrowings under the credit agreement totaled approximately $24 million in principal amount under three term notes, and we also have a revolving line of credit in principal amount of $2 million available for future borrowings.
844161_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information about our credit agreement with JPMorgan.
844161_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	We have acquired a number of new licensees for our brands in a variety of territories in our efforts to expand our portfolio of licensee partners in existing and new markets.
844161_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	Below is a discussion of representative license agreements that we entered into in Fiscal 2016:
844161_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	In April 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Sears Canada Inc.
844161_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The agreement covers a wide range of Cherokee products in the family lifestyle categories, including men s, women s and children s clothing, footwear and accessories, and is planned to launch in the spring of 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	In January 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Argos, a subsidiary of Home Retail Group plc, covering a broad assortment of Cherokee lifestyle products online, in catalogs and in more than 750 Argos stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland, which launched in late July 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement with four wholesale distributors to distribute the Cherokee brand within the U.S. to various retailers beginning in Fiscal 2018.
844161_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The categories cover a wide range of Cherokee products including men s and boy s casual sportswear, sweaters and outerwear; newborn, infant and toddler boys and girls clothing and layette; girl s active wear, sportswear, dresses, denim, and sweaters; and swimwear and sleepwear.
844161_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	In September 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Walmart Canada.
844161_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	and boy s sizes 4-20, which is expected to launch in the fall of 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Sports Direct International plc to launch a broad assortment of Tony Hawk signature clothing and accessories online and in Sports Direct stores throughout Europe in the winter of 2015-2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	In April 2015, we entered into a new license agreement with Sears Canada covering Liz Lange maternity and sportswear, including expanded size ranges, to be sold in Sears Canada stores and online beginning in the spring of 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	This discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
844161_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred revenue, income taxes, impairment of long lived assets, contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation.
844161_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions about future events.
844161_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
844161_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors, such as historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our licensees or franchisees, current economic conditions, bankruptcy, and other factors that may affect the licensees or franchisees ability to pay.
844161_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Revenues from royalty and brand representation licensing agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Our royalty revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	Revenues are not recognized unless collectability is reasonably assured.
844161_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Royalty agreements that account for the majority of our historical revenues are structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of sales are achieved by the applicable licensees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data after required sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year, and as a consequence such royalty rate reductions do not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	We are responsible for the licensing and enforcement of our intellectual property and for pursuing third parties that are utilizing our assets without a license or who have under reported the amount of royalties owed under a license agreement with us.
844161_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	As a result of these activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	These royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently audited or reported as an adjustment to the amounts due from licensees will be recognized as appropriate.
844161_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	We consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy because if the recognition policy or criteria were to change in the future, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Franchise revenues includes royalties and franchise fees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Royalties from franchisees are based on a percentage of net sales of the franchisee and are recognized as earned.
844161_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Initial franchise fees are recorded as deferred revenue when received and are recognized as revenue when a franchised location commences operations, as all material services and conditions related to the franchise fee have been substantially performed upon the location opening.
844161_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	Renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue when the franchise agreements are signed and the fee is paid, since there are no material services and conditions related to these franchise fees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the respective financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
844161_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	A tax position is to be initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	Such tax positions are to be initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance, which generally requires management to assess these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment by estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets.
844161_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if those estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for the related assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	To date, there has been no impairment of intangible assets or other long lived assets for continuing operations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	We evaluate contingent liabilities, including threatened or pending litigation, in accordance with authoritative guidance and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Management makes these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	We account for equity awards in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
844161_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	The fair value of stock options and other stock based awards is estimated using option valuation models.
844161_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	These models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend rate, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the graded amortization method.
844161_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statements of income.
844161_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if any of the estimates above require significant changes, these changes could result in fluctuating expenses that could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance relating to revenue from contracts with customers that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
844161_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board deferred the effective date of this guidance for all entities by one year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	As a result, this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
844161_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and requires additional disclosures if certain criteria are met.
844161_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.
844161_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
844161_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies the balance sheet classification for deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a statement of financial position.
844161_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and allows for full retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
844161_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	The Company has early adopted this guidance, which is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
844161_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing guidance for off-balance sheet treatment of a lessees operating leases.
844161_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after January 1, 2019.
844161_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	The table below sets forth certain of our consolidated financial data for the periods indicated.
844161_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in the current period or in future periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	In Fiscal 2016, our revenues totaled $34.7 million, compared to $35.0 million in Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	The decrease in revenues was primarily related to the closing of Target Canada and the transition from Tesco to Argos, in addition to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international royalties.
844161_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	This decrease was partially offset by revenues from the October 2015 acquisition of Flip Flop Shops.
844161_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our Cherokee brand accounted for approximately 74% and 76% of our aggregate royalty revenues in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $368.0 million and $381.0 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	For Fiscal 2016, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.3 billion, versus $1.4 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Although our Flip Flop Shops brand contributed a small percentage of our revenues in Fiscal 2016 because our acquisition of the brand occurred near the end of the period, we anticipate that its contribution as a percentage of total revenues will increase in future periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	We anticipate revenues will fluctuate depending upon the number of shops opened both domestically and internationally in any given period, as well as royalty fluctuations based on seasonal demand, brand offerings, promotions and number of shops open.
844161_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	Additionally, subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2016, we entered into several new wholesale licensing arrangements covering sales of products bearing our Cherokee Brand in the U.S.
844161_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	We anticipate that the wholesale licensing arrangements will help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company.
844161_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	These wholesale licensing arrangements, and any other similar arrangements we may effect in the future, may cause our results of operations to change in future periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Because we do not have direct oversight over our licensees and franchisees, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given period.
844161_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved for Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S., we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter will continue to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues by brand for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015:
844161_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015:
844161_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Our largest licensees in the U.S. generally are Target and Kohl s, which together contributed 46% and 57% of our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and for Fiscal 2016, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	In Canada, we are transitioning from Target Canada to Sears Canada for our Cherokee and Liz Lange brands.
844161_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Target currently has approximately 1,790 stores in the United States.
844161_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the U.S. were flat in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, at approximately $1.1 billion.
844161_16_ITEM7_P63_S2	Target pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Target.
844161_16_ITEM7_P63_S3	The license agreement is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products in certain product categories in the U.S. during each fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P63_S4	Target also pays fixed royalty rates for Target s sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made by Target through its website (target.com) and sales of Cherokee branded products in the category of school uniforms.
844161_16_ITEM7_P63_S5	In addition, Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of products bearing the Liz Lange brand in the U.S.
844161_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Under the terms of the license agreement with Target, the minimum annual royalty payment from Target is $10.5 million, which applies to all sales of Cherokee branded products made by Target in the United States other than sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category (which products are subject to a separate minimum annual royalty payment of $0.8 million).
844161_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	In Fiscal 2016, Target reached the minimum annual royalty payment of $10.5 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S., excluding sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, were $14.9 million in Fiscal 2016 and $15.0 million in Fiscal 2015, which accounted for 43%, and 43%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Target s U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 totaled $296.8 million, compared to $314.1 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, decreasing by approximately 5.5%.
844161_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, decreasing by approximately 2%.
844161_16_ITEM7_P66_S2	The revenues decreased slightly between periods due to a decline in retail sales for the quarter.
844161_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	In September 2015, Target informed us that it would not renew the license agreement covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S., which expires at the end of its current term on January 31, 2017 for most Cherokee branded products .
844161_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The license agreement with Target, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues in Fiscal 2017.
844161_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to Cherokee until its expiration.
844161_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	We expect Target to reduce sales of Cherokee branded product throughout Fiscal 2017, thereby reducing revenues from Target to amount to no less than their minimum annual royalty.
844161_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	Kohl s currently has approximately 1,200 stores in the United States.
844161_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	Retail sales of Hawk or Tony Hawk branded products at Kohl s totaled $90.6 million in the Fiscal 2016 compared to $119.6 million in Fiscal 2015, decreasing approximately 24.2%.
844161_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Kohl s pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Kohl s.
844161_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The minimum annual royalty payment applicable to our license agreement with Kohl s for the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands is $4.8 million, which applies to all sales of Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products in the U.S.
844161_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	Because retail sales did not exceed the contractual minimum guarantees, royalty revenues from our Hawk and Tony Hawk brands at Kohl s remained flat between periods at $1.2 million and $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2016 respectively, which accounted for 15% and 14% of our consolidated revenues for such periods, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	We have a number of licensees with rights to our brands in various European countries.
844161_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	One of our more significant European licensees is Argos, a subsidiary of Home Retail Group plc, which launched a broad assortment of Cherokee lifestyle products online, in catalogs and in more than 750 Argos stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland in late July 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Other international royalty revenues Fiscal 2016 increased to $9.4 million from $8.9 million in Fiscal 2015, representing a 4.8% increase.
844161_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	This total includes licensees in Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India and other territories.
844161_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	The increase was principally due to strength in Japan, China, India and South Africa, offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
844161_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	In local currencies, the majority of our international licensees had growth in retail sales for Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	The majority of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against an international licensee s foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	As the U.S. dollar strengthened between periods, the estimated cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2016 in comparison to Fiscal 2015 was an approximate $0.8 million decrease.
844161_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, were $21.3 million for Fiscal 2016, compared to $19.6 million for Fiscal 2015, representing an increase of $1.7 million.
844161_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	The increase in SG A was primarily due to additional legal and due diligence costs related to potential and completed acquisitions, an increase in stock-based compensation, increased business development costs related to the identification and establishment of new brand licensees in the U.S. and the costs associated with Flip Flop Shops.
844161_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2016 was $0 million, compared to $0 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2016 was $0.7 million, compared to $0.8 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	For Fiscal 2016, we recorded a tax provision of $4.4 million, compared to $4.7 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Our effective tax rate was 34.1% for Fiscal 2016 and 32.4% for Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 in comparison to Fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon the conclusion during Fiscal 2016 of certain income tax examinations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2016 was $8.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $9.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	In Fiscal 2015, our revenues totaled $35.0 million, compared to $28.6 million in Fiscal 2014.
844161_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and, to a lesser extent, to wholesalers and our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners.
844161_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	The increase in revenues of $6.4 million between periods is primarily attributable to royalties for our Hawk and Tony Hawk brands and royalties from our international Cherokee licensees.
844161_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Our Cherokee brand accounted for approximately 76% and 86% of our aggregate royalty revenues in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $381.0 million and $397.1 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	For Fiscal 2015, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.4 billion, versus $1.4 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2014.
844161_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Because we do not have direct oversight over our licensees, we may not have all the information necessary to determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given period.
844161_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Given our contractual royalty rate reductions as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved for Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S., we expect that our first quarter will continue to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter will continue to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues by brand for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014:
844161_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014:

844161_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	The license agreement is structured to provide royalty rate reductions for Target after it has achieved certain levels of retail sales of Cherokee branded products in certain product categories in the U.S. during each fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM7_P84_S4	Target also pays fixed royalty rates for Target s sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada (until January 2015, when Target announced its decision to discontinue its operations in Canada), sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made by Target through its website (target.com) and sales of Cherokee branded products in the category of school uniforms.
844161_16_ITEM7_P84_S5	In addition, Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of products bearing the Liz Lange brand in the U.S.
844161_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Under the terms of the license agreement with Target, the minimum annual royalty payment from Target is $10.5 million, which applies to all sales of Cherokee branded products made by Target in the United States and, until January 2015, Canada other than sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category ( which products are subject to a separate minimum annual royalty payment of $0.8 million ) .
844161_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	In Fiscal 2015, Target reached the minimum annual royalty payment of $10.5 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S., which excludes sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada (until January 2015) and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, were $15.0 million in Fiscal 2015 and $15.3 million in Fiscal 2014, which accounted for 43%, and 53%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Target s U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 totaled $314.1 million, compared to $317.2 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, decreasing by approximately 1%.
844161_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 and $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014, increasing by approximately 3%.
844161_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	The revenues increased slightly between periods in spite of a slight decline in retail sales due to the declining royalty rate threshold being satisfied earlier in Fiscal 2014 than in Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	As of the end of Fiscal 2015, Kohl s had approximately 1,162 stores in the United States.
844161_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Kohl s pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Hawk and Tony Hawk branded products pursuant to our license agreement with Kohl s.

844161_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	We terminated our license agreement with Tesco as of January 31, 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	We entered into a new license agreement with Argos, a subsidiary of Home Retail Group plc, to launch a broad assortment of Cherokee lifestyle products online, in catalog and in more than 750 Argos stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland, which launched in late July 2015.
844161_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2015 increased to $8.9 million from $7.3 million in Fiscal 2014, representing a 22% increase.
844161_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	This total includes licensees in Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India, and other territories.
844161_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	The majority of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against such foreign currencies.
844161_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against an international licensee s foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	As the U.S. dollar strengthened between periods, the estimated cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2015 in comparison to Fiscal 2014 was an approximate $0.4 million decrease.

844161_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	The increase in expenses between periods is primarily due to expenses related to the marketing and design of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands acquired in Fiscal 2014 and increased marketing expenses associated with our Cherokee brand, offset by a decrease in corporate expenses primarily due to approximately $1.0 million of expenses incurred in Fiscal 2014 related to professional services for the acquisition of Hawk and Tony Hawk, which did not recur, and approximately $1.0 million of professional and consulting fees in Fiscal 2014 related to the identification and remediation of weaknesses in internal control identified in our annual report on Form 10 K/A for Fiscal 2013, which did not recur.

844161_16_ITEM7_P95_S2	The increase in interest expense between periods was due to increased interest expense related to our increased debt, which was used to fund the acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk brands in January 2014.

844161_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Our effective tax rate was 32.4% for Fiscal 2015 and 36% for Fiscal 2014.
844161_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 in comparison to Fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon the conclusion during Fiscal 2015 of certain income tax examinations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2015 was $9.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $6.1 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2014.
844161_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	On January 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 million.

844161_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	In September 2012, we entered into a credit facility with JPMorgan Chase ( JPMorgan ), which was amended in January 2013, January 2014 and October 2015, in each case in connection with our acquisition of new brands.
844161_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Approximately $24 million in principal amount was outstanding under our credit facility as of January 30, 2016, and is evidenced by (i) three term notes, which were issued on January 31, 2013, January 10, 2014 and October 13, 2015 in the principal amounts of $16.6 million, $19 million and $6 million, respectively, and (ii) a revolving line of credit , pursuant to which we may borrow up to $2 million in principal.
844161_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	We paid an upfront fee equal to $0.03 million in connection with the issuance of the term note in October 2015, which is recognized as a debt discount.
844161_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	The terms of the credit facility include various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business financial covenants that set financial standards we must maintain.
844161_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	As collateral for the credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries.
844161_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information about our credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents currently on hand, and up to $2.0 million of funds available to us pursuant to the revolving line of credit issued by JPMorgan under our credit facility.
844161_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and access to funds pursuant to the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other commitments and otherwise support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	In September 2015, Target informed us that it would not renew the license agreement for the Cherokee brand in the U.S., which expires at the end of its current term on January 31, 2017.
844161_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	The license agreement with Target, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues in Fiscal 2017 .
844161_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	We expect Target to reduce sales of Cherokee branded product throughout Fiscal 2017, thereby reducing revenues from Target to amount to no less than their minimum annual royalty.
844161_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flows that will be generated from operations in future periods, and our revenues and cash flows could be materially lower than we expect.
844161_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	If our revenues and cash flows are lower than we anticipate, or if our expenses are higher than we anticipate, then we may not have sufficient cash available to fund our planned operations and we could fail to comply with the terms of our credit facility with JPMorgan or our other contractual commitments.
844161_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	In that case, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities or seek funds from other sources, which may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_16_ITEM7_P108_S3	See Item 1A, Risk Factors .
844161_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	As of January 30, 2016, we were not the guarantor of any material third party obligations and we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our cash requirements over the next twelve months are primarily to fund our operations and working capital, to make payments of principal and interest under our credit facility with JPMorgan, at our discretion and subject to the terms of the credit facility, to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our board of directors ( Board of Directors ), and, to a lesser extent, to fund capital expenditures.
844161_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	As of January 30, 2016, we had approximately $24 million in principal amount of outstanding indebtedness owed under our credit facility with JPMorgan, all of which is due in March 2017.
844161_16_ITEM7_P110_S2	We may seek to refinance all or a portion of this indebtedness before its maturity date.
844161_16_ITEM7_P110_S3	Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.
844161_16_ITEM7_P110_S4	The declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock are subject to negative covenants contained in our credit facility and, assuming the satisfaction or waiver by JPMorgan of such covenants, would be made solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors and would be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider using our liquidity to fund such an acquisition opportunity, subject to obtaining any consent required under our credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of January 30, 2016:
844161_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captioned Fiscal 2017 starts on January 31, 2016 and ends on January 28, 2017.
844161_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	Represents future minimum non cancelable lease payments with respect to the lease of our office facilities in Sherman Oaks, California, Huntington Beach, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota and our equipment leases for the Sherman Oaks and Minneapolis office facilities.
844161_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	The lease for our Sherman Oaks office facility is set to expire on November 1, 2016, subject to our option to extend the lease for an additional five year term, which we exercised subsequent to January 30, 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	The lease for our Minneapolis office facilities is set to expire on June 30, 2018, subject to our option to extend the lease for an additional three year term.
844161_16_ITEM7_P114_S3	We no longer occupy our Minnesota office facilities and, subsequent to January 30, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of such facilities to a third party.
844161_16_ITEM7_P114_S4	The lease for our Huntington Beach office facilities is set to expire on August 14, 2019, subject to our option to extend the lease for an additional five year term.
844161_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Represents future interest (based on current interest rates) and principal payments with respect to our credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	We have agreed to certain contractual royalty rate reductions with Target for sales of certain Cherokee branded products in various product categories in the U.S. in each fiscal year, which apply for future sales during the applicable fiscal year as certain sales volume thresholds are achieved.
844161_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	Historically, this has caused us to record our highest revenues and profits in our first quarter and our lowest revenues and profits in our fourth quarter.
844161_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	However, such historical patterns and seasonal trends may vary significantly in future periods, depending upon retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter by Target, the revenues we receive that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, and the terms of any new license agreements.
844161_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	The rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a material effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	Since most of our future revenues will be based upon a percentage of sales by our licensees and franchisees of products bearing our owned or represented trademarks, we do not anticipate that short term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In relation to our credit facility with JPMorgan, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have had an immaterial impact on interest expense for Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in countries in which our licensees do business when they are converted to the U.S. dollar, and significant fluctuations in exchange rates could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For Fiscal 2016, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 30% of our consolidated revenues.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For Fiscal 2016, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where our licensees operate would have negatively affected our revenues by approximately $1.0 million, which represents 3% of our consolidated revenues reported for Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Such change is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
844161_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016.

844161_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

844161_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
844161_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
844161_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

844161_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	The fiscal years ended January 30, 2016 ( Fiscal 2016 ), January 31, 2015 ( Fiscal 2015 ), and February 1, 2014 ( Fiscal 2014 ) each represent a 52-week period.
844161_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	Receivables are reported at amounts the Company expects to be collected, net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
844161_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, such as historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company s licensees or franchisees, current economic conditions, bankruptcy, and other factors that may affect the licensees or franchisees ability to pay.
844161_16_ITEM8_P15_S1	There was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of January 30, 2016 or January 31, 2015.
844161_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance relating to revenue from contracts with customers that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
844161_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board deferred the effective date of this guidance for all entities by one year.
844161_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	As a result, this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
844161_16_ITEM8_P16_S3	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements is still being evaluated.

844161_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to impact the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies the balance sheet classification for deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a statement of financial position.
844161_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and allows for full retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted.
844161_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	The Company has early adopted this guidance, which is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
844161_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing guidance for off-balance sheet treatment of a lessees operating leases.
844161_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after January 1, 2019.
844161_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company has reclassified certain prior year amounts within the deferred tax assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheets and within the operating activities on the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows, to conform to the Company s current year presentation.
844161_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation and income taxes.
844161_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
844161_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased and money market funds purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
844161_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	At January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the Company s cash and cash equivalents exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) limits.
844161_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
844161_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from the Company s licensees.
844161_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Company's royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned.
844161_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The Company s agreement with Target Corporation ( Target ) covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. accounts for the majority of the Company s historical revenues and, for most such products, is structured to provide royalty rate reductions once certain cumulative levels of retail sales are achieved by Target.
844161_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	sold on Target s website, revenue is recognized by applying the reduced contractual royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data after defined sales thresholds are exceeded.
844161_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	As a result, the Company s royalty revenues as a percentage of Target s retail sales in the U.S. are highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decrease during the fiscal year as Target exceeds sales thresholds as set forth in the Company s agreement with Target.
844161_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	The amount of Cherokee brand royalty revenue earned by the Company from Target in any quarter is dependent not only on Target s retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target s cumulative level of retail sales for most Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM8_P26_S4	Historically, with Target, this has caused the Company to record its highest revenues and profits in its first quarter and its lowest revenues and profits in its fourth quarter.
844161_16_ITEM8_P26_S5	However, such historical patterns may vary in the future depending upon the terms of any new license agreements, retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter from Target and revenues the Company receives that are not be subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales.
844161_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	In order to ensure that Cherokee s licensees are appropriately reporting and calculating royalties owed to Cherokee, all of Cherokee s license agreements include audit rights to allow Cherokee to validate the amount of the royalties paid.
844161_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Any revenue resulting from these audits, or other audits, is recognized in the financial statements of the current reporting period.
844161_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	Revenues from arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received or billable by the Company in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of the Company, are deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	Deferred revenues also represent minimum licensee revenue royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non refundable to the licensee.
844161_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	Deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Franchise revenues includes royalties and franchise fees.
844161_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Royalties from franchisees are based on a percentage of net sales of the franchisee and are recognized as earned.
844161_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	Initial franchise fees are recorded as deferred revenue when received and are recognized as revenue when a franchised location commences operations, as all material services and conditions related to the franchise fee have been substantially performed upon the location opening.
844161_16_ITEM8_P29_S3	Renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue when the franchise agreements are signed and the fee is paid, since there are no material services and conditions related to these franchise fees.

844161_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	The Company intends to renew these registrations, as appropriate, prior to expiration.
844161_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company monitors on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of the Company s trademarks, and relies primarily upon a combination of trademark, copyright, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect the Company s intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
844161_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Trademark registration and renewal fees are capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
844161_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	Trademark acquisitions are capitalized and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or are capitalized as indefinite-lived assets, if no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit their useful lives to Cherokee.
844161_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment at least annually.
844161_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Franchise agreements have been treated as finite-lived and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the agreements.

844161_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for the possibility of impairment at least annually.
844161_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
844161_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
844161_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments.
844161_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Long term debt approximates fair value due to the variable rate nature of the debt.
844161_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	The realizability of long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount.
844161_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	Long lived assets that will no longer be used in the business are written off in the period identified, since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the Company.
844161_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	Long-lived assets that will continue to be used by the Company need to be evaluated for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
844161_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections.
844161_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	The estimated undiscounted cash flows used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement are considered a Level 3 input, which consist of unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.
844161_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	These inputs would be based on the best information available, including the Company s own data.
844161_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_16_ITEM8_P46_S3	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
844161_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
844161_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	Cherokee limits credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with quality financial institutions.
844161_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	At January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the Company s cash and cash equivalents exceeded FDIC limits.
844161_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are minimal due to the limited amount of open receivables and due to the nature of the Company s licensing royalty revenue program.
844161_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support licensee receivables.
844161_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	One licensee, Target, accounted for approximately 43% and 48%, respectively, of trade receivables at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 and approximately 53%, 53% and 66%, respectively, of revenues during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.
844161_16_ITEM8_P49_S3	Another licensee, Kohl s, accounted for approximately 16% and 18%, respectively, of trade receivables at January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015 and approximately 14% and 14% of revenues during Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	The terms of the Company s relationship with Target are set forth in a restated license agreement with Target, which was entered into effective as of February 1, 2008 and amended (i) on January 31, 2013 to add the category of school uniforms, (ii) on April 3, 2013 to provide for a fixed royalty rate of 2% for sales of Cherokee branded products in the category of adult merchandise sold on Target s website (target.com) in Fiscal 2015 and in future periods and (iii) on January 6, 2014 to reflect Target s election to renew the agreement through January 31, 2017 and to provide that Target can renew the agreement for successive two (2) year periods, provided that it satisfies the minimum annual royalty payment of $10,500 for the preceding fiscal year (the Restated Target Agreement ).
844161_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	The Restated Target Agreement grants Target the exclusive right in the United States to use the Cherokee trademarks in various specified categories of merchandise.
844161_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	In January 2015, Target announced its decision to discontinue operations in Canada.
844161_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	On September 3, 2015, Target orally informed the Company that the Restated Target Agreement would not be renewed and will terminate at the end of its current term, which expires January 31, 2017.
844161_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Restated Target Agreement, including the existing royalty obligations, will remain in effect and continue to generate revenues to Cherokee in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 until its expiration, except that Target will continue to sell Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category until January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to Cherokee for sales of these products during this period.
844161_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Under the current terms of the Restated Target Agreement, the minimum annual royalty payment for Target is $10,500 and applies to all sales made by Target in the United States and until January 2015 Canada, other than sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category (which products are subject to a separate minimum annual royalty payment of $800).Under the Restated Target Agreement, Target has agreed to pay royalties based on a percentage of Target s net sales of Cherokee branded merchandise during each fiscal year, which percentage varies according to the volume of sales of merchandise other than sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category and, beginning in Fiscal 2015, other than sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that are made on Target s website.
844161_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company assumed a separate license agreement with Target for the Liz Lange brand in connection with the Company s acquisition of the applicable assets in September 2012.
844161_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	In connection with the acquisition of the Hawk and Tony Hawk signature apparel brands and related trademarks in January 2014, Cherokee and Kohl s entered into an amended license agreement.
844161_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	Pursuant to the license agreement, Kohl s is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk branded apparel and related products in the United States for a four-year term and has agreed to pay Cherokee an annual royalty rate for its sales of Hawk branded signature apparel and related products in the United States, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment of $4,800 .
844161_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Generally, the Company s Direct to Retail licensees fund their own advertising programs.
844161_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	Cherokee s marketing, advertising and promotional costs were approximately $964, $956 and $700 during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM8_P55_S2	These costs are expensed as incurred and were accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses.
844161_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company provides marketing expense money to certain large licensees based upon sales criteria to help them build the Company s licensed brands in their respective territories, thus providing an identifiable benefit to Cherokee; the amounts paid for such marketing expenses during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 were approximately $389, $222 and $70, respectively, and are included in the Company s total marketing, advertising and promotional costs.
844161_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
844161_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	Diluted EPS is similar to the computation for basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
844161_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	However, nonvested restricted stock awards (referred to as participating securities) are excluded from the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding in accordance with authoritative guidance under the two class method, since the nonvested restricted stockholders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock as if the shares were fully vested and hence are deemed to be participating securities.
844161_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Under the two class method, earnings attributable to nonvested restricted stockholders are excluded from net earnings attributable to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share.
844161_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	Shares of nonvested restricted stock have no material impact on the calculation under the two class method.
844161_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Authoritative guidance establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements.
844161_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets).
844161_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the Company has no comprehensive income components and accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income.
844161_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	Repurchased shares of the Company s common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired.
844161_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	When the Company reissues treasury stock, and the proceeds from the sale exceed the average price that was paid by the Company to acquire the shares, the Company records such excess as an increase in additional paid in capital.
844161_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price the Company paid to acquire the shares, the Company records such difference as a decrease in additional paid in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded, with the balance recorded as a decrease in retained earnings.
844161_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	When a lease includes lease incentives (such as a rent abatement) or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, rental expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and amounts payable under the lease is included in deferred rent and lease incentives in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
844161_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	For leasehold allowances, the Company records a deferred lease credit on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred lease credit as a reduction of rent expense in the consolidated statements of income over the term of the lease.
844161_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company accounts for equity awards in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
844161_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The fair value of stock options and other stock-based awards is estimated using option valuation models.
844161_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	These models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend rate, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and the Company has elected to use the graded amortization method.
844161_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the consolidated statements of income.

844161_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	The 2013 Plan authorized to be issued 700,000 additional shares of common stock, and (ii) 121,484 shares of common stock previously reserved but unissued under the 2006 Plan.
844161_16_ITEM8_P105_S3	No future grants will be awarded under the 2006 Plan, but outstanding awards previously granted under the 2006 Plan continue to be governed by its terms.
844161_16_ITEM8_P105_S4	Any shares of common stock that are subject to outstanding awards under the 2006 Plan which are forfeited, terminate or expire unexercised and would otherwise have been returned to the share reserve under the 2006 Plan will be available for issuance as common stock under the 2013 Plan.
844161_16_ITEM8_P105_S5	The 2013 Plan provides for the issuance of equity based awards to officers, other employees and directors.
844161_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	Stock options issued to employees are granted at the market price on the date of grant, generally vest over a three-year period, and generally expire seven to ten years from the date of grant.

844161_16_ITEM8_P106_S2	The Company has also granted non plan stock options to certain executives as a material inducement for employment.
844161_16_ITEM8_P106_S3	The Company accounts for stock options under authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
844161_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Company estimates the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model.
844161_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period in the consolidated statements of income.
844161_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures over the award s service period.
844161_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	Stock based compensation expense recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses for stock options in Fiscal 2016 was approximately $1,100, for Fiscal 2015 was approximately $800, and for Fiscal 2014 was approximately $900.
844161_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	The estimated fair value of options granted during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 as of each grant date was estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
844161_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
844161_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock price.
844161_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term.
844161_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	The dividend yield is based on the past dividends paid and the current dividend yield at the time of grant.
844161_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	A summary of activity for the Company s stock options as of and for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 is as follows:
844161_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the plans for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 was $6.35, $3.49, and $4.09, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company s closing stock price on January 30, 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares subject to in the money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on January 30, 2016 (the last trading day of Fiscal 2016).
844161_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company s common stock.
844161_16_ITEM8_P114_S2	The total intrinsic value of options exercised for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 was $1,731, $411 and $6, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	As of January 30, 2016, total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to nonvested stock options was approximately $2,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.11 years.
844161_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	The total fair value of all options that vested during Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 was approximately $700, $700, and $800, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	In 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors granted certain performance based equity awards, or performance stock units, to executives under the 2006 Plan.
844161_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	The performance metric applicable to such awards is compound stock price growth, using the closing price of the Company s common stock on February 1, 2013, or $13.95, as the benchmark.
844161_16_ITEM8_P116_S2	The target growth rate is 10% annually, which results in an average share price target of (i) $15.35 for Fiscal 2014, (ii) $16.88 for Fiscal 2015 and (iii) $18.57 for Fiscal 2016.
844161_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	The average share price is calculated as the average of all market closing prices during the January preceding the applicable fiscal year end.
844161_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	If a target is met at the end of a fiscal year, one third of the shares subject to the award will vest.
844161_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	If the stock price target is not met at the end of a fiscal year, the relevant portion of the shares subject to the award will not vest but will roll over to the following fiscal year.
844161_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	The executive must continue to be employed by the Company through the relevant vesting dates to be eligible for vesting.
844161_16_ITEM8_P117_S4	The target average share price was not achieved for Fiscal 2014, but was achieved for Fiscal 2015, which resulted in the vesting of two-thirds of the shares subject to each award.
844161_16_ITEM8_P117_S5	The target average share price was not achieved for Fiscal 2016, which resulted in the cancellation of one-third of the shares subject to each award.
844161_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	Since the vesting of these performance based equity awards is subject to market-based performance conditions, the fair value of these awards was measured on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model for each vesting tranche.
844161_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award and calculates the fair market value for the performance stock units granted.
844161_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions and the resulting fair value of the award.
844161_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	In August 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted a performance stock unit award to an employee under the 2013 Plan, which vests in five increments dependent upon achievement of certain annual sales targets.
844161_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	The fair value of this award was measured on the effective date of grant using the price of the Company s common stock.
844161_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	In June 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted restricted stock units and stock options to each member of the Board of Directors and to each of the Company s executive officers under the 2013 Plan.
844161_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	All of these equity awards vest in equal annual installments over three years, such that the full grants shall be vested on the third anniversary of the grant date.
844161_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	The fair value of the restricted stock unit awards was measured on the effective date of grant using the price of the Company s common stock.
844161_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for performance stock units and restricted stock units was approximately $1,100, $400 and $200 for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.
844161_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	The following table summarizes information about performance stock units and restricted stock units activity as of and for Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016:

844161_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
844161_16_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
844161_16_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_16_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_16_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_16_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

844161_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	The failure of Tenant or Landlord to submit a written determination of the Fair Market Rental Rate for the Option Term within such ten (10) business day period shall conclusively be deemed to be such party s approval of the Fair Market Rental Rate for the Option Term submitted within such ten (10) business day period by the other party.

844161_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	The determination of the appraisers shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord s or Tenant s submitted Fair Market Rental Rate for the Option Term is the closer to the actual Fair Market Rental Rate for the Option Term as determined by the appraisers, taking into account the requirements with respect thereto set forth in Section 5.2 above.
844161_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	Each such appraiser shall be appointed within fifteen (15) days after the Outside Agreement Date.

844161_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Cherokee Global Brands is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, and Sideout, and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	As part of our business strategy, we also regularly evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	We believe the strength of our brand portfolio and platform of design, product sourcing and marketing capabilities has made us one of the leading global licensors of style focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home products and accessories.
844161_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	We have entered into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations to provide them the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to provide them access to our proprietary 360-degree platform.
844161_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	We refer to this strategy as our Direct to Retail or DTR licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	We have also entered into wholesale arrangements for the manufacture and sale of products bearing certain of our brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	We refer to this strategy as our Wholesale licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1_P1_S4	Further, in connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops trademark and related assets, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, franchise agreements with franchisees that operate Flip Flop Shops retail stores located worldwide.
844161_17_ITEM1_P1_S5	In addition, we conduct direct and indirect product sales to select distributors and government entities for our Hi-Tec and Magnum brands .
844161_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	We believe our retail responsiveness process and 360-degree unique value proposition have allowed Cherokee Global Brands to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of the wholesalers, distributors and retailers that are selling our portfolio of lifestyle brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that we continually measure, evaluate and incorporate into our 360-degree platform, we believe Cherokee Global Brands has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.
844161_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	As of January 28, 2017, we had 124 continuing license agreements in over 110 countries, 24 of which pertained to the Cherokee brand and 81 of which pertain to the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	We create and establish our brands with a view to global scalability by developing marketing strategies and innovative products for each brand and deploying the tools developed through our 360-degree capabilities platform.
844161_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our key strengths are exemplified by the following three value pillars, which guide our strategies and which we believe position us to expand our business:
844161_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Vision We deliver our licensee partners a brand vision designed to drive differentiation and a fresh point of view for engaging customers across every touch point and in multiple categories.
844161_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Agility We offer our licensee partners access to our 360-degree platform, which is designed to provide the agility to quickly seize opportunity and swiftly introduce our branded products.
844161_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Scale We believe the scalability of our brands enables our licensee partners to fully leverage our brands physical and digital spaces with multi-category relevancy and with globally recognized brands that drive a seamless customer experience.
844161_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We derive revenues primarily from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers all over the world.
844161_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our current licensee relationships cover over 110 countries and over 12,000 retail stores and Ecommerce businesses that includes relationships with Walmart, Target Corporation ( Target ), Kohl s Illinois, Inc.
844161_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	( Kohl s ), Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Nishimatsuya Walmart, Big 5, Academy, JD Sports, Black s, and REI.
844161_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our two most significant licensees in Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016, and Fiscal 2015 were Target and Kohl s.
844161_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a territory or channel-specific license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	We collaborate with our licensees product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing, and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or expand the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	In several cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although many products are subject to our pre approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards and many of our licensees marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	We plan to continue to solicit new licensees using our Direct to Retail licensing model in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand our business.
844161_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe that the Direct to Retail licensing model generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering our licensees the ability to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	This differentiation can also provide the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a premium for our high-equity brand offering over private label price points, which can result in increased profit margins, even after royalties have been paid to the licensor.
844161_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The licensees generally directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating the licensor s exposure to inventory and manufacturing risk while allowing the licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Many of the world s largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands based on the DTR licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Examples of retailers actively participating in the DTR licensing model include Walmart, Target, Carrefour, Kohl s and C A, among others.
844161_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our Direct to Retail licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that, for many retailers worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, accessory, footwear and home categories, including product development, design, merchandising, sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers themselves, who typically command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with their end consumers.
844161_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	We believe that many of these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than by carrying only private label goods or by carrying only branded products obtained from third party vendors.
844161_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	We also believe that many retailers may be able to achieve enhanced profitability with our Direct to Retail licensing model because it allows them to avoid the substantial marketing costs associated with establishing and maintaining an in store brand.
844161_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	We also license our brands to manufacturers and distributors based on wholesale arrangements.
844161_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	Wholesale licensing arrangements generally involve licensing to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, accessory, footwear, and home products under our trademarks and trademarks owned by third parties and sell the licensed products to retailers, which then resell the products to consumers.
844161_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Although our strategy has historically been focused primarily on the DTR licensing model, we have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements for the Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum 50 Peaks and Interceptor brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	We believe these arrangements signal an expansion to our strategy to increase the sales of products bearing our brands in the United States, including our namesake Cherokee brand, which has been governed by one license agreement using our DTR licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	We believe these wholesale licensing arrangements will help to diversify our sources of revenue, increase our royalty rates through our licensee or other partner relationships and will provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, including the opportunity to further expand the reach of our brands into markets where a DTR licensing model may not be the most effective approach.
844161_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	Recently, through our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016, we have signed up wholesalers in the U.S., Pan-European and South Africa territories for our Hi-Tec and Magnum brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Since our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands, we have been indirectly selling footwear bearing these brands to certain select wholesalers and government entities that are customers of these brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	In these arrangements, the purchasers of the products place their product orders directly with us, which we then forward to a manufacturer for the manufacture and delivery of the products directly to the original purchaser.
844161_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	As a result, the product purchasers in these arrangements receive products directly from the manufacturer, which is similar to our wholesale licensing relationships and eliminates most inventory and manufacturing risk.
844161_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	We maintain these indirect product sale relationships with a minimal portion of the customers of the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	This indirect product sales system pre-existed our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and we do not intend to expand this model to other customers of these brands or to our other brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	See Item 7, Management s Discussion Analysis Recent Developments for further information regarding the Hi-Tec acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our franchise business involves licensing our Flip Flop Shops brand to third-party franchisees that operate retail stores under this brand name.
844161_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	In our franchising operations, we typically specify the products and services that will be offered by the franchisees and also provide them with an operating system and other operational support.
844161_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Flip Flop Shops franchise structure aligns with our strategic plan and business model .
844161_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	As part of our growth plan for Flip Flop Shops, we intend to expand store inventory to include more Company-owned brands and expand the retail concept through a combination of new retail store locations, shop-in-shops and mobile commerce.
844161_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	During January 2017 we launched an e-commerce platform for Flip Flop Shops.
844161_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	Cherokee Global Brands markets brands it owns and brands it represents.
844161_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Generally, when representing brands, we perform a range of services including product design, product sourcing through third party manufacturers, the creation of marketing assets, solicitation of licensees, contract negotiations and administration and maintenance of license or distribution agreements, among other things.
844161_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	In exchange for our services, we typically receive a certain percentage of the net royalties generated by the brands we represent.
844161_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	Summaries of some of our brands are provided below.
844161_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Cherokee is an iconic, American family lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual and comfortable products at affordable prices.
844161_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Cherokee, which was initially launched as a footwear line in 1973, seeks to produce timeless classics, inspired by vintage Americana while continually being updated to account for modern trends.
844161_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	After four decades, the Cherokee brand stands for confident, effortless and relaxed American style.
844161_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	We believe this heritage positions the Cherokee brand for future growth and further international expansion.
844161_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	Additional categories of Cherokee branded products are sold internationally, including adult apparel, home d cor, textiles, outdoor furnishings and camping gear.
844161_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Historically, the Cherokee brand s most significant licensee was Target, which launched the Cherokee brand almost two decades ago as a multi category product offering that encompassed kid s apparel, accessories, footwear and school uniforms (the rights to which we acquired in January 2013).
844161_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our relationship with Target covering Cherokee branded products ended in January 2017.
844161_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our former license agreement with Target granted Target exclusive rights to the Cherokee brand in various specified categories of merchandise in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Under this license arrangement, for all of Target s sales of Cherokee branded products, except for sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada (which ceased as a result of Target Canada bankruptcy), sales of Cherokee branded adult products sold on Target s website and sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category, Target paid us royalties based on rates that reduced after Target achieved specified cumulative sales volume thresholds during each fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	retroactively to Target s retail sales since the beginning of the applicable fiscal year, but rather applied only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume threshold.
844161_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our license arrangement with Target governing sales of Cherokee branded adult products sold on Target s website and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category provided for a fixed royalty rate based on Target s net sales of products during each fiscal quarter.
844161_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of most Cherokee branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to Cherokee Global Brands until its expiration.
844161_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Royalty revenues from Target s sales of products bearing the Cherokee brand, in the Unites States, excluding sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category, were $10.5 million during Fiscal 2017, $14.9 million during Fiscal 2016 and $15.0 million during Fiscal 2015, which accounted for 31%, 43%, and 43% of our total royalty revenues during the respective periods.
844161_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	Replacing the royalty revenues received from Target for Cherokee branded products is a significant challenge, and the expiration of this license agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	See Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Founded in 1974 and based in the Netherlands, the Hi-Tec footwear brand seeks to produce quality shoes for a fair price.

844161_17_ITEM1_P25_S3	Today, the Hi-Tec brand is one of the world s leaders in sports and outdoor footwear.
844161_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We acquired the Hi-Tec, Magnum, and other associated footwear brands in December 2016.
844161_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Before our acquisition, the Hi-Tec brands were operated under a full spectrum distribution model, meaning that one group of affiliated companies owned the brands and manufactured the products.
844161_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	In connection with our acquisition of these brands, we sold the associated operating assets to certain operating partners and/or distributors and entered into new wholesale licensing arrangements with these operating partners and/or distributors.
844161_17_ITEM1_P26_S3	Through these transactions and our post-acquisition integration efforts, we are converting the Hi-Tec brands to a branded licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1_P26_S4	Going forward, we primarily intend to pursue a wholesale licensing model for these brands.

844161_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	This license agreement, as amended, grants Kohl s exclusive rights, through July 2017 at which point, the contract converts to a non-exclusive right to sell the Tony Hawk and Tony Hawk Signature apparel brands in various specified categories of merchandise in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	The current term of the license agreement, as amended, with Kohl s continues through January 31, 2018, and obligated Kohl s to pay Cherokee Global Brands an annual minimum royalty of $4.8 million prior to January 28, 2017 and $4.6 million for the remainder of the term.

844161_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our key business strategies include the following:
844161_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	As part of our strategy, we provide our licensees with access to our proprietary 360 degree platform which seamlessly integrates with our licensing model and which we believe is part of the attraction of our brands to our retailers and other licensees.
844161_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our 360 degree platform includes the following:
844161_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Product Design and Development Our product design and development activities are led by design teams that work collectively with the licensees for each of our brands to develop a story, point of view and point of difference, develop product guidelines, including graphic language, fabrics, quality details and trim, and oversee execution to maintain brand integrity including pricing and line architecture.
844161_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	These teams also assist in developing innovative seasonal product design concepts for our brands to maximize organic growth opportunities that lead to category expansion.
844161_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Marketing and Media Support Our marketing services are designed to evolve and strengthen the positioning of our brands in collaboration with our retail partners on a direct to consumer and consumer to consumer basis by, among other things, creating enhanced in store experiences with the introduction of custom design fixtures and visual displays, developing an integrated retail strategy across all consumer touch points, including in store, social media and other online avenues and cultivating relationships with credible brand ambassadors.

844161_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Organic growth involves introducing new product categories with existing partners and expanding existing brands into new stores and new territories.
844161_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	We are focused on the following organic growth drivers: a larger online presence with our partners in order to capitalize on the growth of digital commerce; enhanced in-store experiences, such as shop-in-shop floor presentations; product category expansion such as new apparel categories, home, sportswear, beauty, athletic, designer, denim, performance and accessories; and growth of our partners businesses, including opening new stores or otherwise expanding their operations.

844161_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	We target style-focused lifestyle brands, such as our recently acquired Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Everyday California and Flip Flop Shops brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P51_S2	We evaluate new brand candidates based on their global market potential and product category expansion opportunities, in categories such as home, sportswear, beauty, athletic, designer, denim, performance, footwear, and accessories.

844161_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	In our efforts to expand our portfolio of licensee partners, we acquired a number of new licensees for our existing brands in a variety of territories in Fiscal 2017, some of which are described below.
844161_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	During Fiscal 2017, we entered into license agreements with nine wholesale distributors to distribute a variety of categories of products bearing the Cherokee brand within the U.S. to various retailers beginning in Fiscal 2018.

844161_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	We entered into three additional license agreements (two during Fiscal 2017 and one during Fiscal 2018) for our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	The license agreements are for broad distribution of the brands in the United States for all retail, including specialty, mid-tier, regional, mass market, off-price and club retail.
844161_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Our rights to receive royalties for sales of products bearing our brands are set forth in the terms of our license agreements with various retailers and wholesalers.
844161_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary depending on the terms of each licensing agreement.
844161_17_ITEM1_P56_S2	Generally, our DTR license agreements include royalty rates based on a percentage of the retailer s net sales of licensed products.
844161_17_ITEM1_P56_S3	Some of our DTR license agreements provide for royalty rates calculated based on a fixed percentage of retail product sale, and other DTR license agreements provide for royalty rates that may decrease or otherwise fluctuate depending on the retailer s achievement of certain annual sales volume thresholds.
844161_17_ITEM1_P56_S4	For wholesale license agreements, royalty rates are generally calculated based on a fixed percentage of wholesale sales from the wholesaler to the retailer.
844161_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	In many cases, particularly in our DTR licensing arrangements, we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum annual royalty payment to us each year.
844161_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	Our largest guaranteed minimum annual royalty payment for Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 was from Target for $10.5 million for each period.
844161_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	As of January 28, 2017, we had contractual rights to receive over $108.8 million forward facing minimum royalty revenues over the next six years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period that has been defined in the applicable license agreement.
844161_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	In order to ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license agreements grant us the right to audit our licensees retail sales data for our brands to validate the amount of sales reported and royalties paid.
844161_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	Franchisees who wish to operate Flip Flop Shops retail locations in the United States enter into a franchise agreement with us that generally provides franchise rights for each location for an initial term of 10 years and typically includes a 10-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions as specified in the franchise agreement.
844161_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The agreements provide the franchisee the rights to use the Flip Flop Shops brand name, trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Flip Flop Shops retail store.
844161_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	Franchisees typically pay us an initial franchise fee and royalty fees based on a percentage of gross sales at each retail store.
844161_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	In certain non-U.S. markets, we may grant a master franchisee exclusivity to develop or sub-franchise a territory for a specified number of new Flip Slop Shops locations in the territory based on a negotiated schedule.
844161_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	In these instances, the master franchisee pays an initial master franchise fee, a per-location opening fee and a royalty fee based on a percentage of gross sales at the retail stores.
844161_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	As described under Licensing and Other Selling Models above, we maintain indirect product sale relationships with certain select wholesalers, distributors and government entity customers of the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, until such time that we convert the arrangements to traditional wholesale licensing arrangements.
844161_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	We began recording revenues from these relationships in December 2016 when we acquired these brands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	In these arrangements, the retailers and government entities that purchase products submit payments directly to us for their product orders, the pricing of which is typically a preset percentage markup to our cost, and we then remit the cost of these payments to the manufacturer of the purchased products.
844161_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	As a result, a significant portion of our revenues from these indirect product sales is paid out to manufacturers as a cost of the product sales.
844161_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	In Fiscal 2017, we recorded a total of $6.6 million in revenues from these indirect product sales, of which a total of $5.1 million was paid to manufacturers or distributors as a cost of the product sales.
844161_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	We hold various trademarks, including Cherokee , Hi-Tec , Magnum , 50 Peaks , Interceptor , Hawk Signature , Tony Hawk , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Flip Flop Shops , Everyday California , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz , Sideout , Sideout Sport , and other, in connection with numerous categories of apparel and other goods.

844161_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	We also hold trademark applications for each of these brand names and others in numerous countries.
844161_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our business is dependent upon our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
844161_17_ITEM1_P64_S4	We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of our trademarks, and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademarks, know how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights domestically and internationally.
844161_17_ITEM1_P64_S5	See Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees net sales of licensed products.
844161_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Additionally, franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand pay us a percentage of their net sales.
844161_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	Merchandise bearing our Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, and Sideout brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, as well as merchandise sold by Flip Flop Shops retail shops, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, and Route 66.
844161_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	Factors that shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers and wholesalers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers, engaging wholesalers to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers, and entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners.
844161_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees ability to sell products bearing our or third-party brands, and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition, we compete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers and wholesale manufacturers in the United States and internationally, including with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention, limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold and time and resources of wholesale licensees that manufacture our products.
844161_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	Our business and performance may be subject to certain seasonality trends.
844161_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulate our Flip Flop Shops franchising activities.
844161_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	For instance, the Federal Trade Commission requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement, and several states require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offerings and sales.
844161_17_ITEM1_P69_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and any applicable foreign anti-bribery laws.
844161_17_ITEM1_P69_S3	We are also subject to various laws that are generally applicable to businesses in our industry, such as work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations.
844161_17_ITEM1_P69_S4	Our violation of any of these laws could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	As of January 28, 2017, we employed 123 persons; however, of these employees, 40 are providing transition services for us in connection with our recent acquisition of Hi-Tec and therefore are not expected to remain our employees for the longer term.
844161_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
844161_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to the Company s directors, officers, employees and manufacturers that produce products on behalf of our licensees.

844161_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause our stock price to decline.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensees net sales of licensed products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Additionally, franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand pay us a percentage of their net sales.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Merchandise bearing our Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, and Sideout brands, all of which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees, as well as merchandise sold by Flip Flop Shops retail shops, are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Such competitors with respect to the Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona, Merona, and Route 66.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Factors that shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our business plan in the United States focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers, engaging wholesalers to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers, and entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of and desire for our brands, our licensees ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees ability to sell products bearing our or third-party brands, and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Failures with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We cannot control the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and changing preferences and trends may lead customers to purchase other products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Further, we cannot control the level of resources that our licensees or franchisees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support products bearing other brands to the detriment of our brands because our agreements generally do not prevent our licensees from licensing or selling products of third parties, including our competitors.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, we compete with other companies owning established trademarks, which have entered into, and could continue to enter into, similar arrangements with retailers and wholesale manufacturers in the United States and internationally, including with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention, limited floor and rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold and time and resources of wholesale licensees that manufacture our products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to risks related to the retail business that are applicable to our licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	There are numerous risks and other factors applicable to the businesses of retailers (including our licensees and franchisees) that can impact the sale of products that bear our brands and, with respect to our franchisees, the sale of products bearing other brands from which we generate revenues.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any decline in sales by one or more of our licensees or franchisees could adversely affect our revenues.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Factors that may adversely affect our licensees and franchisees and their sales of products include the following, among others: (i) weather, environmental or other conditions that may impact consumer shopping activity in retail stores; (ii) consumer preferences regarding fashion trends and styles, which can be region-dependent and subject to rapid and significant fluctuations; (iii) consumer preferences regarding where to shop; (iv) the growth of online shopping and the ability of our licensees and franchisees to market and sell products through these avenues; (v) changes in the availability or cost of capital in light of the financial condition and capital requirements of our licensees and franchisees; (vi) shifts in the seasonality of shopping patterns; (vii) fluctuating retail prices; (viii) the reputation of or general consumer perceptions about the retailers that sell our brands; (ix) labor strikes or other interruptions that impact supply chains and transport vendors; (x) the impact of excess retail capacity; (xi) changes in the cost of accepting various payment methods and changes in the rate of utilization of these payment methods; (xii) material acquisitions or dispositions; (xiii) investments in new business strategies; (xiv) the success or failure of significant new business ventures or technologies; (xv) actions taken or omitted to be taken by legislative, regulatory, judicial and other government authorities and officials; (xvi) security breaches; (xvii) natural disasters, the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism or other significant national or international events; and (xviii) the other risks discussed in this Item 1A.

844161_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Most of our revenues are generated from retailers who license our brands to manufacture and sell products bearing our brands in their stores and on their websites.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, we have a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we have arrangements with several wholesalers who license our brands to manufacture products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Under our existing agreements, these licensees and franchisees pay us fees based in part on the value of products sold.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We rely on our licensees and franchisees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license and franchise fees, preparing our financial reports, projections and budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	All of our license and franchise agreements permit us to audit our licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If any of our licensee or franchisee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenues to which we are entitled on a timely basis or at all, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We utilize various licensing and selling models in our operations, and our success is dependent on our ability to manage these different models.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition to our historical focus on our Direct to Retail licensing model , we recently commenced franchise operations with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand and we intend to grow this business in the future, and we also recently entered into several new licensing arrangements with wholesalers and may seek to enter into additional wholesale arrangements in the future.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Even though our pursuits of these wholesale and franchise models may diversify our sources of revenue, these models could themselves be unsuccessful and could divert management s attention and other resources, including time and capital, from our historical focus on our Direct to Retail licensing strategy.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully manage these multiple licensing and selling models.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we are unable to manage our wholesale and franchise arrangements together with our Direct to Retail licensing model, then our financial condition and prospects would be harmed.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business is dependent on the success of our Direct to Retail licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Although we have recently commenced franchise operations and have pursued additional wholesale licensing arrangements, we have historically been focused on our Direct to Retail licensing model and it continues to be an important part of our operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, we grant retailers a license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We believe the Direct to Retail licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, and our business plan is based on the continued success of this model with our current licensees and with new retailers we may solicit to license our brands in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand this part of our business.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	may turn out to be wrong, and it may not grow as we anticipate.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If our current or potential future retail licensees do not perceive our Direct to Retail licensing model to be advantageous to them, then they may move away from this model and instead embrace alternatives, such as purchasing from wholesalers or manufacturing private label products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Such a change in perception could occur for a variety of reasons, including reasons based on retailers beliefs or expectations that may not turn out to be accurate.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If our Direct to Retail licensing model ceases to be attractive to retailers, then we would be unable to continue to pursue this aspect of our business plan and our financial condition and performance could suffer material adverse effects.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our business has historically been largely dependent on royalties from Target, which no longer sells Cherokee branded products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Until January 31, 2017, Target had exclusive rights to Cherokee branded products for all product categories in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Royalty revenues from Target s sales of Cherokee branded products accounted for greater than 35% of our total revenues during each of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	However, our license agreement with Target covering sales of most Cherokee branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to us until its expiration.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Replacing the royalty revenues received from Target for Cherokee branded products is a significant challenge, and we might not be successful in doing so.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Even though we have entered into arrangements with wholesale licensees for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States, which became operational at the beginning of Fiscal 2018, any increased revenues we may receive from these new wholesale licensees or any other licensees or franchisees may not be sufficient to offset the lost royalty revenues from Target.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If we are not successful in replacing the Target s royalty revenues with equal or greater royalties from other partners the termination of this license agreement could have a material adverse effect upon our revenues and cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We acquired the Liz Lange brand in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Target for this brand would grow in future periods, although such revenue growth may never occur.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Target has informed us that it has elected to not renew the Liz Lange license agreement, which expires on January 31, 2018 at the end of the current term, Target will continue to pay royalties to Cherokee Global Brands until the expiration of the agreement.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Cherokee Global Brands has entered into a master license agreement with a third party for Liz Lange branded maternity products beginning in Fiscal 2019.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our wholesale licensing arrangements subject us to a number of risks.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In our wholesale licensing relationships, we license our brands to manufacturers that produce and import various categories of apparel, footwear, home products and accessories under our trademarks and sell the licensed products to retailers.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements, primarily covering our newly acquired Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and sales of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We believe these arrangements signal a significant shift in our strategy for sales of products bearing the Cherokee brand in the United States, which in the past have been governed by a DTR license agreement.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Although we believe these new wholesale licensing arrangements will help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and will provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, these expectations could turn out to be wrong.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If we do not achieve the intended or expected benefits of these wholesale arrangements, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Moreover, we have less experience with the wholesale licensing model than the DTR licensing model and we may find it difficult to develop reliable forecasts and expectations regarding revenues from these arrangements, either of which could harm our business and our operating results.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The minimum annual royalty obligations under our wholesale license arrangements are significantly smaller than the minimum annual royalty obligations in some of our Direct to Retail licensing arrangements, including our former license agreement with Target and our license agreement with Kohl s.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	agreements for the Cherokee, Hi-Tec and Magnum brands are not subject to reducing royalty rates based on cumulative sales levels, as was our former license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	As we begin to recognize revenues from these new wholesale licensees and to the extent we pursue similar wholesale arrangements in the future, their lower minimum royalty obligations and consistent royalty rates could cause our performance and cash flows to be more strongly influenced by the seasonality of the retail business and thus subject to more material fluctuations between periods, and could also cause our aggregate annual royalty revenues to decline if retail sales volume for our brands decreases and we become dependent upon minimum royalty obligations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Additionally, in wholesale arrangements, we have limited ability to control various aspects of the manufacturing process, including access to raw materials, the timing of delivery of finished products, the quality of finished products and manufacturing costs.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our wholesale licensees may not be able to produce finished products of the quality or in the quantities that are sufficient to meet retailer demand, in a timely manner or at all, which could result in an inability to generate revenue from any such products and loss of retailer confidence in our brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	On the other hand, wholesale licensees may produce inventory in excess of retailer and consumer demand, in which case over-supply may cause retail prices of products bearing our brands to decline.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Additionally, there may be delays in the manufacturing process over which we may have no control, including shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, backlogs or insufficient devotion of resources to the manufacture of products bearing our brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Further, we compete with other brand owners for the time and resources of our wholesale distributors, which could curtail or limit our ability to engage new or maintain relationships with existing wholesale licensee partners on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Interruptions in the supply of products bearing our brands to retailers or lapses in quality could adversely impact our reputation and financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Further, the unplanned loss of any of our wholesale licensees could lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of products bearing our brands, create negative impressions of us and our brands with retailers and consumers and add downward pressure on prices of products bearing our brands as a result of liquidating a former wholesaler s inventory of such products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Revenues from our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands largely depend on Kohl s for Fiscal 2018.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In January 2014, we acquired the Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Concurrently with this acquisition, we entered into a retail license agreement with Kohl s, pursuant to which Kohl s is granted the exclusive right to sell Tony Hawk and Hawk-branded apparel and related products in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We agreed to this exclusive license in part based upon our expectation that revenues from Kohl s for these brands will grow in future periods, although this expectation may turn out to be wrong and such revenue growth may never occur beyond the $4.6 million minimum annual royalty payment required under the license agreement, as amended.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The failure of our licensees or franchisees to sell products bearing our brands or that otherwise generate royalties to us, to pay us royalties for such products or to renew their license or franchise agreements with us could result in a decline in our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license and franchise agreements.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Although the license agreements for our brands in many cases provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us, the failure of our licensees or franchisees to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us, their decision to not renew their agreements with us or their inability to grow or maintain their businesses could cause our revenues to suffer.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Further, while we historically have been dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl s, the concurrent failure by several of our other material licensees or franchisees to meet their financial obligations to us or to renew their respective license or franchise agreements could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and conversion of these brands to a new business model is subject to significant risks.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We acquired the Hi-Tec, Magnum and other associated footwear brands in December 2016.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Before our acquisition, the Hi-Tec brands were operated under a full spectrum distribution model, meaning that one group of affiliated companies owned the brands and manufactured the products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	wholesale licensing arrangements with these operating partners and/or distributors.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Through these transactions and our post-acquisition integration efforts, we are converting the Hi-Tec brands to a branded licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Going forward, we primarily intend to pursue a wholesale licensing model for these brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The acquisition of these brands and our conversion of their distribution model to align with our brand licensing model are subject to significant risks, as these brands have not historically been marketed, distributed and sold in this manner and it is uncertain whether this model will be effective for these brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	As a result, we are not able to reliably forecast or predict the impact of these brands on our revenues or other aspects of our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Further, the roles and responsibilities of the parties in the distribution chain for these products, including our Company, as the licensor of the brands and overseer of high-level marketing strategies, the wholesalers we engage to manufacture and distribute products bearing these brands, and the retailers to which the wholesalers sell these products for ultimate resale to consumers, will be different following our conversion of these brands to our brand licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	The wholesalers we have engaged for these brands to date, which consist of former operating partners and/or distributors of these brands, may not be familiar with or accustomed to our brand licensing model and may not be successful in converting their distribution efforts to align with this model.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Further, as we make efforts to expand these brands to new geographic and consumer markets, we expect to pursue new arrangements with additional wholesale licensees for these brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	However, as with any effort to expand into new markets, any new wholesalers we may engage in the future for these brands, as well as the retailers and consumers they reach, may not be familiar with the brands and may not accept them.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Any such outcome could result in failures to sell products bearing these brands in volumes and at prices that generate expected levels of revenue to us.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Additional risks associated with our acquisition of these brands include, among others, the following: (i) we expect our strategy for these brands to focus on wholesale licensing, and as a result, our efforts to build this brand will be subject to all of the risks associated with wholesale arrangements, including our dependence on third parties that we do not control, our lack of significant experience with wholesale arrangements and the other risks of wholesale licensing discussed elsewhere in these risk factors; (ii) the geographic scope of these brands is more significant than many of our other brands, and as a result, these operations will amplify the risks related to the international scope of our business, including less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property in some jurisdictions and the other risks associated with our international operations discussed elsewhere in these risk factors; (iii) our conversion of the business model for these brands will require significant efforts, costs and other resources, which will divert attention from our other brands and could cause the performance of our other brands to suffer; and (iv) the acquisition of these brands has already involved significant time and costs, including the cash purchase price for the assets and our other expenses associated with the transaction, which has forced us to increase our debt levels and use significant amounts of cash on-hand and which puts significant pressure on our liquidity, particularly in light of the risks associated with our ability to manage and grow these brands under a new licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In light of the significance of the risks related to our acquisition of the Hi-Tec, Magnum and associated footwear brands and our efforts to convert their distribution model, we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of these brands and we may never generate sufficient royalty revenues from these brands to recoup their costs.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If any of these outcomes were to occur, our performance, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our indirect product sales of products bearing the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands involve risks, including certain collection and credit risks and decreased comparability of our operating results.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Since our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016, we have been indirectly selling footwear bearing these brands to certain select wholesalers and government entities that are customers of these brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In these relationships, the purchasers of the products place their product orders directly with us, which we then forward to a manufacturer for the manufacture and delivery of the products directly to the original purchaser.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The wholesalers and government entities that purchase products under these arrangements submit payments directly to us for their product orders, the amount of which is typically determined based on a pre-established percentage mark-up to our cost, and we then pay the manufacturer of the purchased products for the cost of the order.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	As a result, we retain a percentage of the payments made to us by wholesalers and government entities.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	revenues from these indirect product sales, of which a total of $5.1 million was paid to manufacturers or distributors as a cost of the product sales.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Due to the payment structure for these arrangements, a significant portion of our revenues from indirect product sales is paid out to manufacturers as a cost of the product sales.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Since the cost portion of these revenues, representing the product cost, are not retained by us, they are recorded as costs of goods sold in our consolidated financial statements and do not significantly increase our operating net income (loss).
844161_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As a result, for as long as we maintain these indirect product sale arrangements, we may record increased revenues that do not materially increase our operating income (loss).
844161_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	The addition of indirect product sales to our business model, which has historically been exclusively focused on licensing and franchising relationships, could substantially reduce the comparability of our results of operations across periods and render such comparisons less meaningful.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, although the product purchasers in these arrangements receive products directly from the manufacturer, which is similar to our wholesale licensing relationships, our indirect role in these product sales does not completely remove us from certain risks related to the manufacture and delivery of the products.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	For instance, since we are between the purchaser and the manufacturer in the product payment cycle, the wholesalers and government entities that purchase products under these arrangements may hold us financially responsible for product delivery failures or other similar events.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Additionally, since these arrangements place us in direct contact, either through product order placement or receipt or payment of funds, with both the customer and the manufacturer of the products, we may be subject to increased credit risks based on these relationships.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Moreover, serving as an intermediary between product customers and product manufacturers with respect to order placement and payment, and our role as such may expose us to additional risks of which we are not presently aware or we may not be able to effectively serve in this role.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Further, although we intend to convert these indirect product sale arrangements to traditional direct or wholesale licensing relationships as the existing arrangements expire, the wholesalers and government entities with which we maintain these arrangements may not be amenable to a such a licensing relationship, in which case we could lose these customers or be required to maintain business relationships that would change our present business model.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely affect our customer relationships and our performance.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our franchise business exposes us to numerous risks.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of this brand.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Flop Shops retail stores located across the globe, including in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Africa.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	This new Flip Flop Shops franchise business exposes us to a variety of risks, including, among others, that: (i) we may not be able to find capable and experienced franchisees who can implement the Flip Flop Shops brand concept and strategies we believe are necessary for the future growth of this brand or sell merchandise and operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements; (ii) even if we are able to attract capable franchise owners, these franchisees may not be able to open new Flip Flop Shops retail stores in a timely manner or manage and maintain them once opened, secure desirable site locations, obtain adequate financing, construct and develop new store locations without delays and attract qualified operating personnel; (iii) the third party brands that are sold at Flip Flop Shops stores could decline in popularity or decide to stop selling their merchandise at some or all of the Flip Flop Shops store locations; (iv) neighborhood or economic conditions or other demographic patterns where existing or new Flip Flop Shops stores are located could decline or otherwise change in a negative way; and (v) our franchise business is subject to complex and varying franchise laws and regulations imposed by the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may need to devote significant costs and resources in order to learn and comply with these laws and regulations and we may be subject to various penalties, including monetary fines or other sanctions if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If any of these risks were to materialize, the reputation of the Flip Flop Shops brand or our other brands could be damaged, sales volume at one or more Flip Flop Shops store locations could decline, existing store locations may close or new may store locations may fail to open at expected rates or at all, the Flip Flop Shops brand name may not grow as we anticipate, or our franchise revenues relating to this brand could be limited, curtailed or reduced, any of which could harm our performance and prospects.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and the corresponding impact on levels of consumer spending, which may affect our licensees and franchisees retail sales.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Further, the worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Purchases of apparel, footwear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income typically declines.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	As a result, during periods of economic uncertainty, slowdown or recession, the risks associated with our business are generally more acute.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	For instance, general uncertainty in U.S. economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions has increased following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election due to the unpredictability of the policies and direction of the new administration, and these uncertainties may result in decreased confidence in the U.S. or global economy and decreased levels of consumer spending.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	In addition to decreased consumer spending generally, these periods of uncertainty, slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or any other negative trend in either the U.S. or the global economy is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with the international scope of our operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Many of our licensees and franchisees are located outside the United States, as we franchise our Flip Flop Shops brand and market and license our other brands outside the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a key component of our business strategy, we intend to expand our international sales as well as the support we provide our international licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	During Fiscal 2017, approximately 37% of our revenues were derived from our international licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, our business associated with our newly acquired Hi-Tec family of footwear brands is managed and operated by our Dutch subsidiary that we formed for the purpose of the acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including, among others: (i) our general lack of experience operating foreign subsidiaries, (ii) unusual, unfamiliar or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including tax, labor, contract, intellectual property protection and other laws, and unexpected changes to these laws or requirements; (iii) difficulties complying with the laws of multiple jurisdictions; (iv) uncertainties related to developing legal and regulatory systems and standards for economic and business activities, property ownership and the application of contract rights; (v) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargos, and other trade barriers, about which there is increased uncertainty following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the trade policies of the new administration, including withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and proposed revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement; (vi) difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to conduct our foreign operations or manage our foreign licensees and franchisees; (vii) challenges relating to labor and employment matters, including differing employment practices and requirements regarding health, safety and other working conditions in foreign jurisdictions; (viii) competition from foreign companies; (ix) longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; (x) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property in some jurisdictions; (xi) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region, particularly in emerging markets; (xii) potentially adverse tax consequences from the several U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation; and (xiii) cultural differences in the conduct of business.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any one or more of such factors could cause our future international sales to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and applicable foreign anti-bribery laws, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Additionally, and because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees or franchisees operations may negatively impact our royalty revenues.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We have contracts with government entities that are subject to unique risks.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We have, and expect to maintain, long-term contracts with various foreign government entities, which primarily relate to our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition to normal business risks, including the other risks discussed in these risk factors, our contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	For instance, long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	As a result, the termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that contract, which could have a negative impact on our operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In periods of global or local political tension or unrest or decreased spending, these risks could be amplified.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	In addition, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us at their convenience and without prior notice and would only be required to pay for work completed and commitments made at the time of termination.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Any such modification, curtailment or termination of significant government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our success to date has been due in large part to the strength of our brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associate one or more of our brands with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our business may be similarly affected in the future.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business and reputation and could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial results.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As disclosed in Item 9A of this Annual Report, management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S3	As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 28, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S4	This conclusion could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our reported financial information, which could result in a significant decline in the market price of our common stock.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Additionally, our reputation with lenders, retailers, investors, securities analysts and others may be adversely affected.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P61_S6	Moreover, these effects could continue even after we have determined that the identified material weaknesses are remediated.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Although we have developed and initiated a remediation plan designed to address the material weaknesses we have identified, this plan may not be fully implemented in a timely or effective manner, the remedial measures included in the plan will involve significant time and costs and will distract management from our core business operations, and these remedial measures could be insufficient to address the material weaknesses.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P62_S1	In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, these controls and procedures may not be adequate in future periods and additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control could occur or be discovered.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If any of these risks were to occur, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Any such restatement could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees and litigation, significant reputational harm and material declines in our stock price.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Compliance with changing securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards could increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team, and any compliance failures could materially harm our business.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Existing laws, regulations, listing requirements and other standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure significantly increase the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Our management team devotes significant time and financial resources to try to comply with existing and evolving standards for public companies.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	However, notwithstanding our efforts, we have failed to comply with the SEC s reporting deadlines applicable to this Annual Report, and it is possible that additional financial and other public reports we are obligated to file in the future also may not be considered timely, accurate or complete.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In order to re-establish compliance with our public reporting requirements, we intend to hire additional personnel, engage consultants or other third-party advisors and change our internal practices, standards and policies, which could significantly increase our costs and divert management s time and attention from revenue-generating activities.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P64_S4	In addition, noncompliance with these reporting requirements could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could involve fines or other penalties, and could also adversely affect our financial results, result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information and other public disclosures and jeopardize the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, as described below.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P64_S5	If any of these risks were to occur, our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could materially decline.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated or proposed new rules on a variety of subjects, including, for example, with respect to the preparation and filing of financial statements, establishment or disclosure of clawback and hedging policies and disclosure of executive compensation information.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The existence of new and proposed laws and regulations relating to financial reporting or other disclosure obligations or that impose additional or more stringent compliance requirements could create uncertainties for public companies, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees, and generate significantly increased costs if we are required to add additional accounting or other staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices in order to comply with the new requirements.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The occurrence of any of these outcomes could significantly harm our business, financial condition and performance.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property, and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights or we may become involved in costly legal proceedings regarding our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of third parties.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We hold various trademarks for our brands, including Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, Sideout and others in connection with apparel, footwear, home and accessories.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	These trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding government agencies in numerous other countries and we also hold trademark applications for these brands in a number of other countries, although the laws of many countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, adequate protection in these jurisdictions may be unavailable or limited.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	These actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not prevent imitation of our products, infringement of our intellectual property rights by unauthorized parties or other challenges to our intellectual property ownership, or prevent the loss of licensing or franchise revenue or other damages caused thereby, including a reduction in value of our licenses that could make it easier for competitors of our licensees to capture increased market share.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S4	If any of these events occurs, our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S5	In the future, we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties, and one or more parties may assert infringement claims against us.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S6	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P67_S7	Further, if any adverse ruling in any such matter occurs, any resulting limitations in our ability to market or license our brands could reduce the value of our licenses and our intellectual property assets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We may become involved in other litigation or government or administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action and other litigation and claims.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We may also be the subject of government and other regulatory investigations, audits and proceedings, including in connection with any claim of our violation of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business, such as federal, state and foreign franchise laws, anti-bribery laws and work safety and labor laws, among others.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Furthermore, because litigation and administrative or government proceedings are inherently unpredictable, any of these proceedings could result in unfavorable outcomes, which could include monetary damages or fines and other sanctions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Any such result could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We are dependent on our key management personnel.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Our success is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key executives, consisting of Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors ( Board of Directors ), Howard Siegel, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jason Boling, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as certain of our other key employees, including Ed van Wezel, the Chief Executive Officer of our subsidiary that manages our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, Martin Binnendijk, the President and Chief Operating Officer of our subsidiary that manages our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, and Brian Curin, the President of our subsidiary that manages our Flip Flop Shops franchise operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We have a limited number of employees, and Mr. Stupp s and our other executives leadership and experience in the apparel licensing industry, Mr. Curin s expertise in the franchising industry, and Messrs. van Wezel s and Binnendijk s experience with our newly acquired Hi-Tec family of footwear brands are important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives or other employees.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other executives or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We may encounter difficulties in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions and we may not realize the expected benefits from these transactions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	During our three most recently completed fiscal years, we have completed three such acquisitions: our acquisition of the Everyday California Lifestyle brand in May 2015; our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015; and our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio of products and services or expand the breadth of our markets.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Our experience integrating acquired assets and businesses is limited, and we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits from an acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage an expanded portfolio of brands, which could involve significantly increased costs and pose substantial challenges for management.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	customer markets, such as our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands in December 2016, including regional differences in consumer preferences, branding standards and the general conduct of business, less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of intellectual property in some foreign jurisdictions and other risks related to doing business outside the United States; and (ix) risks associated with new types of business arrangements in which we have no or limited prior experience, such as our acquisition of franchise agreements and entry into the franchising business upon our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Accordingly, our recent acquisitions as well as any future transactions that we pursue may not result in the anticipated benefits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In addition, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If we seek to finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities or by incurring other types of indebtedness, we may experience the risks associated with these transactions that are described in these risk factors below.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Further, we may seek such financing from sources that expose us to additional risks, such as our receivables funding loan agreement entered into with one of our directors, Mr. Jess Ravich, in December 2016 in connection with our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands, which creates a conflict of interest between us and Mr. Ravich that could have negative effects.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Any of these effects could harm our operating results or financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness to pay the cash consideration for our recent acquisitions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Our level of indebtedness, and restrictions under such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We entered into a credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC ( Cerberus ) in December 2016.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	As of the date of this report, approximately $45.0 million in principal amount is outstanding under our term loan facility with Cerberus.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P77_S2	As of the date of this report, we also have $5.0 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility with Cerberus.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Our outstanding indebtedness under the Cerberus credit facility is due in December 2021.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The Cerberus credit facility imposes various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain Cerberus s consent before we can, among other things and subject to certain limited exceptions: (i) incur additional indebtedness or additional liens on our property, (ii) consummate acquisitions, dispositions, mergers or consolidations, (iii) make any change in the nature of our business, (iv) enter into transactions with our affiliates, or (v) repurchase or redeem any outstanding shares of our common stock or pay dividends or other distributions, other than stock dividends, to our stockholders.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The Cerberus credit facility also imposes financial covenants that set financial standards we will be required to maintain.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Further, as collateral for the Cerberus credit facility, we have granted a first priority security interest in favor of Cerberus in substantially all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by our subsidiaries.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P78_S3	If an event of default occurs under the credit facility, that is not forborne, or cured or waived in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, Cerberus has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit facility, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit facility and exercise any other rights it may have, including foreclosing on our assets that serve as collateral for the loan.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P78_S4	We obtained a waiver to this credit facility on April 28, 2017, due the late filing of the Company s Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. Our failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and liquidity.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	We may seek to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness in the future.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures, brand acquisitions and other general corporate purposes as and when needed, which could force us to suspend, delay or curtail business prospects, strategies or operations.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available when needed , on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend upon many factors, including, among others: acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; the costs of developing new brands; the extent to which we invest in new brands; the number and timing of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions; the costs associated with our expansion, if any; and the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to defend our trademarks.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In the future, we may need to raise additional funds, and such funds may not be available when needed, on favorable terms, or at all.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, as we did with our public offering of our common stock in December 2016, our existing stockholders would experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders, and if we incur additional debt to raise funds, as we did with our new credit facility with Cerberus entered into in December 2016, we may become over-leveraged and our ability to operate our business may be restricted by the agreements governing the debt.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Moreover, our late filing of this Annual Report renders us ineligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3, and we will not regain such eligibility until we have timely filed our periodic reports with the SEC for 12 consecutive calendar months.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	We do not know when we will meet this requirement, which depends upon our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	If we seek to raise capital through an offering of our securities while we remain ineligible to use Form S-3, our inability to use this form could limit our financing alternatives, reduce our ability to access capital in a timely manner and increase our transaction costs, any of which could make it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	If we cannot raise funds when needed, on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P84_S1	This may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In recent periods, we have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of products bearing our brands and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand such initiatives in future periods.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing on these initiatives will expand our business and build stockholder value over the long-term, we may not be successful in doing so and such initiatives may not result in the intended benefits.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Any failure by us to execute on our strategic initiatives, or the failure of such initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We must successfully maintain and/or upgrade our information technology systems.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We rely on various information technology systems, including our Enterprise Resource Planning system, to manage our operations, which subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our information technology, potential disruption of our internal control systems, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and delays or difficulties in upgrading existing systems, transitioning to new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	If any of these risks were to materialize, our operations could be disrupted and our performance could be harmed.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our business and operations would suffer in the event of cybersecurity and other system failures.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our licensees and franchisees are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P90_S1	Although we have not experienced any such cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach to date, some of our licensees, including Target, have experienced such events in the past.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If such an event were to occur to our internal systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations, substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if possible, loss of or damage to our data or applications, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or the incurrence of other material liabilities.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P90_S3	If such events were to occur to our licensees or franchisees systems, our royalty revenues could be reduced or disrupted due to decreased sales of our branded products as a result of reputational damage, diversion of costs and other resources from selling products bearing our brands or inability of our licensees or franchisees to calculate royalties or generate royalty reports.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Any of these events could severely harm our business, results of operations and prospects.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Changes in our effective tax rates or tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our net income.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We are subject to income tax in the United States, California and certain other state jurisdictions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, following our acquisition of the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, we are also subject to taxation in several foreign jurisdictions, which may have unusual, unfamiliar or particularly burdensome tax laws.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Our new global tax structure could be negatively impacted by various factors, including changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions in which we earn income or changes in tax laws or interpretations of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, all of which could impact our future effective income tax rates.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Our effective tax rates could also be adversely affected in the future by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Any increase in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Further, we may be audited by tax authorities, which could evaluate and disagree with our judgments regarding our tax provisions.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be expensive to defend and materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P93_S4	The results of an audit or litigation could materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The trading price of our stock may be volatile and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The trading price of our common stock is likely to be subject to fluctuations as a result of various factors impacting our business, including, among others: (i) our financial results; (ii) the successful completion of any acquisition or strategic transaction, including the integration of the acquired assets or businesses into our existing business and realization of synergies and other benefits of the acquisition or transaction; (iii) announcements by us, our retail partners or our competitors, as applicable, regarding or affecting the retail environment either domestically or internationally, the reputation of our brands, our existing or new license agreements and brand representations or acquisitions, strategic alliances or other transactions; (iv) recruitment or departure of key personnel; (v) changes in the estimates of our financial results or changes in the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; (vi) any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including the material weaknesses we identified as of January 28, 2017 that are described elsewhere in these risk factors, or any failures to comply with applicable public reporting requirements, as has occurred with this Annual Report and as is described elsewhere in these risk factors; (vii) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole; and (viii) the other risks described in these risk factors.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Further, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	common shares may have a greater impact on the trading price for our common stock than would be the case if our public float was larger.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We are not in compliance with NASDAQ s requirements for continued listing, and if NASDAQ does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with applicable listing rules, our common stock may be delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	On May 3, 2017, we received a deficiency letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ) indicating that, as a result of not filing this Annual Report in a timely manner, we were not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The deficiency letter indicated that we have until July 3, 2017 to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ s continued listing standards; however, we believe our filing of this Annual Report has resulted in our regained compliance with NASDAQ s continued listing standards and has eliminated the need to submit such a compliance plan.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P99_S2	Although we believe that, as of our filing of this Annual Report, we are currently in compliance with NASDAQ s continued listing requirements, we could fail to comply with these requirements again in the future.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P99_S3	In that case, we would receive additional deficiency letters from NASDAQ and our common stock could be delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, which could severely limit the liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	The determination regarding the payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and therefore we may not pay any dividends in future periods, whether or not we generate sufficient cash to do so.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In addition, pursuant to our credit facility with Cerberus, subject to limited exceptions, we are prohibited from paying dividends or making other distributions to our stockholders without Cerberus s consent.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	As a result, any return on an investment in our common stock may be limited to an appreciation in the value of our common stock.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	The sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, such as under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or upon expiration of any lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, including under the lock-up agreements entered into in connection with our public offering of our common stock in December 2016, or upon our issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or the vesting of restricted stock units, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P103_S1	The availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our Certificate of Incorporation allows our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, without action by our stockholders.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Subject to the restrictions under our new credit facility with Cerberus, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our Board of Directors in its discretion, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our common stock.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P105_S2	For instance, such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to our common stock, could have superior voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or could have other terms that negatively impact the voting control or other rights of our common stockholders.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Additionally, the ownership interest of holders of our common stock would be diluted following the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P105_S4	Further, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company.
844161_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We may fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our common stock to decline in value.

844161_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that could harm our business.
844161_17_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we are a party or to which our property is subject that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol CHKE .
844161_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for each of the fiscal quarters during our two most recently completed fiscal years, the range of the high and low sales prices for our common stock and the cash dividends declared and paid per share, if any.
844161_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of April 20, 2017, the approximate number of stockholders of record of our common stock was 65.
844161_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	This figure does not include an indeterminable number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies.
844161_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	In the future, from time to time, our Board of Directors may declare cash dividends depending upon Cherokee Global Brands financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital requirements, compliance with our credit facility with Cerberus and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

844161_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe that a comparable peer group of publicly traded licensing companies exists.
844161_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	As a result, we have compared the return on investment in our common stock to the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S P 100 Stock Index.

844161_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements we make because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong.
844161_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	As used in this discussion and analysis, Cherokee Global Brands , the Company , we , us and our refer to Cherokee Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates or requires otherwise.
844161_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Additionally, as used herein, Fiscal 2018 refers to the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018; Fiscal 2017 refers to the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017; Fiscal 2016 refers to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016; and Fiscal 2015 refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31, which aligns with our retail licensees who generally also operate and plan using such a fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Each of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 was a 52 week fiscal year, and Fiscal 2018 will be a 53-week fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Certain of our international licensees report royalties to us for quarterly and annual periods that may differ from ours.
844161_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We do not believe that the varying quarterly or annual period ending dates from our international licensees have a material impact upon our reported financial results, as these international licensees maintain comparable annual periods in which they report retail sales and royalties to us on a year to year basis.
844161_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Cherokee Global Brands is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns or represents, licensing the Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, and Sideout brands and related trademarks and other brands in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	As part of our business strategy, we also regularly evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe the strength of our brand portfolio has made us one of the leading global licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home products and accessories.
844161_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	We have entered into license agreements with recognizable retail partners in their respective global locations to provide them the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to provide them access to our proprietary 360-degree platform.
844161_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	We refer to this strategy as our Direct to Retail or DTR licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	We have also entered into wholesale arrangements for the manufacture and sale of products bearing certain of our brands, including nine new wholesale arrangements with distributors that started to sell products bearing our Cherokee brand at retail in the United States at the beginning of Fiscal 2018 and wholesale arrangements for our newly acquired Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and we conduct indirect product sales to select wholesalers and government entities for our Hi-Tec and Magnum brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	In addition, we have franchise relationships for the Flip Flop Shops brand with franchisees that operate Flip Flop Shops retail stores located worldwide.
844161_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We believe that the Direct to Retail licensing model generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering licensees the ability to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	This differentiation can also provide the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a premium over private label price points, which can result in increased profit margins, even after royalties have been paid to the licensor.
844161_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	manufacturing risk while allowing the licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	In addition, we believe that our wholesale licensing and franchise relationships will help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and will provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, including the opportunity to further expand the reach of our brands into markets where a DTR licensing model may not be the most effective approach.
844161_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We believe our retail responsiveness process and 360-degree value proposition have allowed Cherokee Global Brands to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of the retailers that are selling our portfolio of lifestyle brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that we continually measure, evaluate and incorporate into our 360-degree platform, we believe Cherokee Global Brands has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	As of January 28, 2017, we had 124 continuing license agreements in over 110 countries, 24 of which pertained to the Cherokee brand and 81 of which pertain to the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	We are guided by three value pillars that speak to our diverse global partners, Vision, Agility, Scale:
844161_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Vision Brand vision that will drive differentiation and a fresh point of view to engage customers across every touch point and in multiple categories.
844161_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	The agility of our unique 360-degree platform to quickly seize opportunity and swiftly introduce our branded products.
844161_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Scale The ability to fully leverage our brands physical and digital spaces with multi-category relevancy and with globally recognized brands that drive a seamless customer experience.
844161_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We derive revenues primarily from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers all over the world.
844161_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our current licensee relationships cover over 110 countries and over 12,000 retail stores and online businesses and include relationships with Walmart, Target Corporation ( Target ), Kohl s Illinois, Inc.
844161_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	( Kohl s ), Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Nishimatsuya Walmart, Big 5, Academy, JD Sports, Black s, and REI.
844161_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our two most significant licensees in Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016, and Fiscal 2015 were Target and Kohl s.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Generally, royalty rates for our Direct to Retail license agreements vary as a percentage of the retailer s net retail sales of licensed products.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	In some cases, royalty rates are calculated based upon a fixed percentage of product sales.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	In other cases we have license agreements that provide for reduced royalty rates based on volume thresholds once specified cumulative levels of retail sales of merchandise in certain product categories are achieved during each fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S3	The royalty rate reductions do not apply retroactively to the applicable licensee s retail sales since the beginning of the year, but rather apply only to sales made during the applicable fiscal year subsequent to the achievement of the specified sales volume.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S4	For example, the amount of royalty revenue earned by us from Target in any quarter was dependent not only on Target s retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the U.S. in that quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering their cumulative level of retail sales for certain Cherokee branded products in the U.S. for the fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S5	As a result, for such license agreements, our royalty revenues as a percentage of our licensees retail sales were typically highest at the beginning of each fiscal year and decreased if and when certain retail sales thresholds were met.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S6	Historically, this has caused our first quarter to be our highest revenue and profitability quarter and our fourth quarter to be our lowest revenue and profitability quarter.
844161_17_ITEM7_P17_S7	However, such historical patterns and seasonal trends may vary significantly in future periods, depending upon retail sales volumes achieved in each quarter by Target, the revenues we receive from Target and our other licensees that are not subject to reduced royalty rates based upon cumulative sales, and the terms of any new license agreements.
844161_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The terms of our royalty arrangements vary for each of our licensees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	In most cases we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum royalty.
844161_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	These minimum royalty guarantees require our licensees to pay us a minimum royalty each year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	2017, and in the case of Kohl s, its minimum annual guaranteed royalty was $4.8 million for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 and $4.6 million for Fiscal 2018.
844161_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	As of January 28, 2017, we had contractual rights to receive over $108.8 million forward facing minimum royalty revenues over the next six years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail sales information for Cherokee branded products and other product brands that we own or represent.
844161_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Additionally, pursuant to our typical franchise agreements, franchisees pay us a royalty fee based on a percentage of gross sales at each franchise retail location.
844161_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	However, our licensees and franchisees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period to period fluctuations in retail sales.
844161_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a result, and except as noted elsewhere in the comparisons of our three most recently completed fiscal years, we do not have sufficient information to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or mix of products sold by our licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	See Item 1A, Risk Factors .
844161_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Because the majority of our international revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of our international licensees operations may impact our royalty revenues.
844161_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Additionally, we generally record the sales of our international licensees and franchisees in U.S. dollars, and our disclosure related to the sales of such licensees and franchisees throughout this Annual Report is denominated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
844161_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	In arriving at such denominations, we receive a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our licensees and franchisees that is denominated in the applicable foreign currency.
844161_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	These amounts are then converted to U.S. dollars using the appropriate exchange rate for the purpose of disclosing all retail sales in U.S. dollars.
844161_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	For all periods presented in this Annual Report, we do not consider the period to period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on the accuracy of the U.S. dollar denominated figures presented in this Annual Report.
844161_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Until January 31, 2017, Target had exclusive rights to Cherokee branded products for all product categories in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Royalty revenues from Target s sales of Cherokee branded products accounted for greater than 35% of our total revenues during each of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	However, our license agreement with Target covering sales of most Cherokee branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	We have entered into new wholesale licensing agreements, discussed below under New Licensee Partners, which are intended to replace our former relationship with Target for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	However, replacing the royalty revenues received from Target for Cherokee branded products is a significant challenge, and the expiration of this license agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_17_ITEM7_P25_S5	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	for $87.2 million in cash, excluding non-interest bearing liabilities assumed and capitalized transaction costs.
844161_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cherokee Global Brands created a legal entity entitled Irene Acquisition Company B.V. (the buyer ) to execute the transaction.
844161_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We completed the Hi-Tec Acquisition with the objective of converting Hi-Tec into a licensing business that would align with our core business.
844161_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Thus, concurrently with the SPA, we entered into APAs with new operating partners of Hi-Tec, including Carolina Footwear Group, LLC ( CFG or Carolina ), Batra Limited ( BL or Batra ) and Sunningdale ( South Africa ).
844161_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	These agreements provided for the sale of certain manufacturing-related operating assets of Hi-Tec and its subsidiaries to these operating partners.
844161_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	Post-acquisition, consistent with our planned conversion of the Hi-Tec business, we continue to own the intellectual property assets of Hi-Tec, and have entered into license agreements with three main licensees Batra (UK and Europe), Carolina (US and Canada) and Sunningdale (South Africa).
844161_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	The Company does not have any ownership interests in the CFG, BL or South Africa entities.
844161_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Hi-Tec and its subsidiaries were a Dutch footwear business that design, market and sell footwear globally, primarily under the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Hi-Tec sold its products through major retailers, independent distributors, licensees, government contracts and directly to consumers via e-commerce.
844161_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Prior to the Hi-Tec Acquisition, Hi-Tec operated under a full spectrum distribution model, meaning that one group of affiliated companies owned the brands and manufactured the products.
844161_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Through the Sale Transactions and our post-acquisition integration efforts, we are converting the Hi-Tec business to a branded licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Until this conversion is complete, we conduct indirect product sales of footwear bearing these brands to certain select wholesalers and government entities, which represent a minor portion of the customers of these brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Going forward, we primarily intend to pursue a wholesale licensing model for these brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	Our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and conversion of these brands to a new business model is subject to significant risks.
844161_17_ITEM7_P30_S5	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	In connection with the closing of the Hi-Tec Acquisition, substantially all of the then-existing indebtedness of Hi-Tec has been repaid.
844161_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	The SPA contains customary warranties and indemnities for a Dutch transaction.
844161_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Subject to certain carve-outs and qualifications as set forth in the SPA and subject to certain limited exceptions, our recourse for breaches of warranties under the SPA will be to a warranty and indemnity insurance policy.
844161_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	We funded the purchase price of the Hi-Tec Acquisition through cash on hand, proceeds from the Sale Transactions, the prepayment of the first year of guaranteed minimum royalties under license agreements with certain operating partners and/or distributors of Hi-Tec, net proceeds of a public offering of our common stock, proceeds from a new credit facility and proceeds from a receivables funding loan extended by one of our directors, each of which is described below.
844161_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	On November 29, 2016, we entered into sales agreements with operating partners and/or distributors of Hi-Tec, including Carolina Footwear Group, LLC and Batra Limited.
844161_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	These sales agreements provide for the sale of certain of the operating assets of Hi-Tec and its subsidiaries to these operating partners and/or distributors.
844161_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The aggregate cash purchase price of the Sale Transactions was approximately $11.3 million, based on expected working capital and subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
844161_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	The Sales Transactions closed substantially concurrently with the closing of the Hi-Tec Acquisition on December 7, 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P34_S4	We used the proceeds from the Sale Transaction to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Consistent with our planned conversion of the Hi-Tec business to our business model, we continue to own the intellectual property assets of Hi-Tec following the Sale Transactions, and certain of the operating partners and/or distributors have entered into wholesale license agreements with us to license certain of these trademarks from, and pay royalties to, us.
844161_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Under these wholesale license agreements, certain of Hi-Tec s operating partners and/or distributors have licensed certain Hi-Tec trademarks in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South Africa and other jurisdictions in Africa.
844161_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	We used the $7.0 million prepayment of the first few years of guaranteed minimum royalties under these license agreements to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	On December 2, 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of 4,237,750 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.50 per share, for net proceeds to us of approximately $38.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses paid by us.
844161_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	We used the net proceeds of the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	On December 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC ( Cerberus ), as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders from time to time party thereto, pursuant to which we are permitted to borrow (i) up to $5.0 million under a revolving credit facility, and (ii) up to $45.0 million under a term loan facility.
844161_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	Also on December 7, 2016, we drew down $45.0 million under the Cerberus term loan facility and used a portion of these borrowings to fund the Hi-Tec Acquisition, including the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness of Hi-Tec, and to repay all amounts owed under our former credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan ).
844161_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	During March 2017, the Company drew $5.0 million under its available revolving credit facility with Cerberus.
844161_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The Cerberus credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on, and security interest in, substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries, is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and has a five-year term.
844161_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	The Cerberus credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to either the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan in New York, New York as its reference rate, base rate or prime rate or LIBOR plus, in each case, the applicable margin and subject to the applicable rate floor.
844161_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Borrowings under the Cerberus credit facility are subject to certain maintenance and other fees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	The terms of the Cerberus credit facility include financial covenants that set financial standards we will be required to maintain and operating covenants that impose various restrictions and obligations regarding the operation of the Company s business, including covenants that require us to obtain Cerberus s consent before we can take certain specified actions.
844161_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	On December 7, 2016, we entered into an unsecured receivables funding loan agreement for $5.0 million with Jess Ravich, the Chairman of our board of directors ( Board of Directors ).
844161_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The receivables funding loan bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum and is subject to a fee equal to 2.5% of the principal amount of the loan, or $0.1 million, which was paid at the funding of the loan.
844161_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	The outstanding principal and accrued interest under the receivables funding loan will be due and payable on June 5, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	The proceeds of the receivables funding loan were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	We expect that certain accounts receivable assets that are expected to be collected in the ordinary course of business will be used to repay the receivables funding loan.
844161_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of the date of this report, the outstanding principal balance of the receivables funding loan is $1.5 million.
844161_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Pursuant to the approval of our Board of Directors, in June 2016 we repurchased and retired 60,082 shares of our common stock in open market transactions at a weighted average purchase price of $12.24 and for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $735,000.
844161_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	As part of our strategy, we pursue relationships with new retailers, wholesalers and other licensees in order to expand the reach of our existing brands into new geographic and customer markets and new types of stores and other selling mediums.
844161_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	This strategy also involves diversifying our types of partner relationships to include additional DTR licensees, wholesale licensees and, with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops trademark and brand name, franchisees of this brand.
844161_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	In our efforts to expand our portfolio of licensee partners, we acquired a number of new licensees for our existing brands in a variety of territories in Fiscal 2017, some of which are described below.
844161_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	During Fiscal 2017, we entered into license agreements with nine wholesale distributors to distribute a variety of categories of products bearing the Cherokee brand to various retailers in the United States, which became operational at the beginning of Fiscal 2018.
844161_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The categories cover a wide range of Cherokee products including men s and boy s casual sportswear, sweaters and outerwear; newborn, infant and toddler boys and girls clothing and layette; girl s active wear, sportswear, dresses, denim, and sweaters; and swimwear and sleepwear.
844161_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	These wholesale arrangements are intended to replace our former relationship with Target covering Cherokee branded products in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	We entered into three additional license agreements (two during Fiscal 2017 and one during Fiscal 2018) for our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The license agreements are for broad distribution of the brands in the United States for all retail, including specialty, mid-tier, regional, mass market, off-price and club retail.
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	This discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, deferred revenue, income taxes, impairment of long lived assets, contingencies and litigation and stock based compensation.
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	Management bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions about future events.
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_17_ITEM7_P46_S6	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
844161_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of various factors, such as historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our licensees or franchisees, current economic conditions, bankruptcy, and other factors that may affect the licensees or franchisees ability to pay.
844161_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
844161_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from our licensees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Our royalty revenue recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Our former license agreement with Target, which accounted for a large portion of our historical revenues, was structured to provide royalty rate reductions for sales of most products covered by the agreement after Target achieved certain cumulative sales volume thresholds, such that revenue was recognized by applying the reduced royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data for these products after the defined sales thresholds were exceeded for the remainder of applicable fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	These royalty rate reductions did not apply retroactively to sales since the beginning of the applicable fiscal year, and as a consequence these royalty rate reductions did not impact previously recognized royalty revenue.
844161_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	Deferred revenues also represent minimum licensee revenue royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non refundable to the licensee.
844161_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	Deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Franchise revenues include royalties and franchise fees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Royalties from franchisees are based on a percentage of net sales of the franchisee and are recognized as earned.
844161_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Initial franchise fees are recorded as deferred revenue when received and are recognized as revenue when a franchised location commences operations, as all material services and conditions related to the franchise fee have been substantially performed upon the location opening.
844161_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	Renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue when the franchise agreements are signed and the fee is paid, since there are no material services and conditions related to these franchise renewal fees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	In order to ensure that our licensees and franchisees are appropriately reporting and calculating royalties owed to us, all of our license and franchise agreements include audit rights to allow us to validate the amount of the royalties paid.
844161_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently audited or reported as an adjustment to the amounts due from licensees or franchisees is recognized in the reporting period in which the differences become known and are determined to be collectible.
844161_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	We are responsible for the enforcement of our intellectual property and for pursuing third parties that are utilizing our assets without a license.
844161_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	As a result of these activities, from time to time, we may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P54_S2	These royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	We consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy because if the recognition policy or criteria were to change in the future, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
844161_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	A tax position is to be initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	Such tax positions are to be initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with authoritative guidance, which generally requires management to evaluate these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
844161_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	This evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections.
844161_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	These analyses involve management judgment based on various estimates and assumptions.
844161_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for the related assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	To date, there has been no impairment of intangible assets or other long lived assets.
844161_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	We test goodwill and indefinite-lived assets annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
844161_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value.
844161_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	This determination is made at the reporting unit level which may be either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information is available.
844161_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	Two or more reporting units within an operating segment may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics.
844161_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company may first assess qualitative factors relevant in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units are less than their carrying amounts.
844161_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	Based on this analysis, the Company may determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
844161_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the amount of any impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit is determined using two steps.
844161_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	First, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy.
844161_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	These inputs include selection of an appropriate discount rate and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles over the implied fair value.
844161_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	These analyses involve management judgment based on various estimates and assumptions.
844161_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for the related assets, which could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	To date, there has been no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
844161_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	We have acquired material intangible assets in connection with business combinations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	These intangible assets consist primarily of brands and distributor relationships.
844161_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination.
844161_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from intangible asset groupings and developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present value of cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of certain tangible assets such as inventory.
844161_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and other tangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.
844161_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	We evaluate contingent liabilities, including threatened or pending litigation, in accordance with authoritative guidance and record estimated reserves when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable.
844161_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	Management makes these assessments based on estimates about the facts and circumstances as they evolve, and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel.
844161_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	We account for equity awards in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.
844161_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The fair value of stock options and other stock based awards is estimated using option valuation models.
844161_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	These models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	The fair value of stock based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and we have elected to use the graded amortization method.
844161_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the consolidated statements of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	We consider this to be a critical accounting policy because if any of the estimates described above require significant changes, these changes could result in fluctuating expenses that could have a material impact on our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.
844161_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	The table below sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated.
844161_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in the current period or in future periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P76_S1	Our results of operations include the transactions for Hi-Tec from December 7, 2016 through January 28, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our royalty revenues totaled $34.0 million, $34.7 million and $35.0 million in Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Royalty revenues for all periods were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and, to a lesser extent, to wholesalers, our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners and, beginning in the third quarters of Fiscal 2016, franchise fees and royalty revenues received from franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand and, beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, revenues from royalties on wholesale sales of products bearing our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands throughout the world.
844161_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	The change in royalty revenues between Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017 was principally due to a decrease in North American royalties as we transition from Target to our new wholesale licensing partners for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Additionally, we had $1.2 million additional royalty revenues from wholesale sales of Hi-Tec, Magnum and Interceptor branded products as a result of the Hi-Tec acquisition during December 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	As of January 28, 2017, we had contractual rights to receive over $108.8 million forward facing minimum royalty revenues over the next six years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Pursuant to our typical arrangements with our licensees and franchisees, we receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic retail information about sales of products that generate royalties to us, including, for our licensees, products bearing the brands we own or represent, and for our franchisees, products sold at each franchise location.
844161_17_ITEM7_P81_S1	However, our licensees and franchisees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period to period fluctuations in retail sales.
844161_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	Because we do not have direct oversight over our licensees and franchisees, we may not have all the information necessary to assess the impact on our operations of changes in price, volume or amount of products sold or the introduction of new products, or to otherwise determine or predict the specific reasons why revenue may increase or decrease in any given period.
844161_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In connection with the Hi-Tec acquisition, we began selling footwear directly to wholesalers throughout varies European countries as well as directly to various government entities around the world.
844161_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The results of these operations are included as indirect product sales in the table above.
844161_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	The following table sets forth our royalty revenues by brand for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016:
844161_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our Cherokee brand accounted for approximately 68%, 74% and 76% of our aggregate royalty revenues in Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $88.0 million, $368.0 million and $381.0 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	For Fiscal 2017, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $766 million, compared to $1.3 billion in total retail sales for Fiscal 2016 and $1.4 billion in total retail sales for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	During Fiscal 2017, we entered into nine new wholesale licensing arrangements covering sales of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United States, which became operational at the beginning of Fiscal 2018.
844161_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	We believe these arrangements signal a significant shift in our strategy for sales of products bearing the Cherokee brand in the United States, which in the past have been governed by our DTR license agreement with Target.
844161_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	These new wholesale arrangements consist of multiple license agreements with nine different distributors that include higher royalty rates but lower minimum annual royalty obligations, as compared to one license agreement with one retailer, Target, that included a lower and declining, tiered royalty rate but a higher minimum annual royalty obligation.
844161_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	This shift to a wholesale licensing model for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States exposes us to a number of risks.
844161_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Under our former license agreement with Target for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States, we agreed to certain royalty rate reductions for sales of most products covered by the agreement, which applied to future sales during a fiscal year after Target achieved certain sales volume thresholds.
844161_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Historically, this has caused the Company to record its highest revenues and profits in its first quarter and its lowest revenues and profits in its fourth quarter.
844161_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	However, we do not anticipate this trend to continue in Fiscal 2018 and in future fiscal years due to the expiration of the Target license agreement at the end of Fiscal 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	As a result, as of the beginning of Fiscal 2018, we are no longer subject to royalty rate reductions over the course of the year for sales of our Cherokee branded products in the United States, as our new wholesale license agreements covering these products include a fixed royalty rate that is consistent throughout the year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Because U.S. wholesalers and retailers typically record their highest sales in the fourth quarter for the holiday season, we anticipate that our performance in future periods could be more strongly influenced by this seasonality of the retail business and potentially subject to more material fluctuations between periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	However, because we have less experience with the wholesale licensing model than the DTR licensing model, our forecasts and expectations regarding revenues from these arrangements may not be reliable.
844161_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Any continuation of the Company s historical revenue and profit patterns or development of any new revenue or profit patterns will depend on, among other things, the terms of the Company s existing license and franchise agreements, excluding the Target license agreement, the terms of any new license or franchise agreements, and retail sales volumes achieved by the Company s licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	In December 2016, we completed the Hi-Tec Acquisition, in which we acquired the intellectual property assets of Hi-Tec, including the Hi-Tec, Magnum and Interceptor brands and related trademarks.
844161_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	In connection with the Hi-Tec Acquisition, we also entered into wholesale license agreements with certain of Hi-Tec s operating partners and/or distributors.
844161_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	Under the license agreements, the operating partners and/or distributors have licensed certain Hi-Tec trademarks in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South Africa and other jurisdictions in Africa.
844161_17_ITEM7_P90_S3	These arrangements are structured similarly to our other wholesale licensing arrangements.
844161_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	In light of the recent date of this acquisition, we are not able to reliably forecast or predict the impact of these brands on our revenues or other aspects of our results of operations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	Our integration of these assets into our business, including transitioning them from a full spectrum distribution model to our brand licensing model, amplifies this uncertainty.
844161_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Franchisees of Flip Flop Shops retail stores in the United States enter into franchise agreements with us that typically have a 10-year initial term and require payment to us of an initial franchise fee and a royalty fee.
844161_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Franchisees of Flip Flop Shops retail stores outside the United States may enter into master franchise agreements with us for multiple store locations within a specified territory.
844161_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	In these instances, the master franchisee typically pays us an initial master franchisee fee, a per-location opening fee (the amount of which varies for each master franchise) and a royalty fee.
844161_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	We anticipate that our Flip Flop Shops brand contribution as a percentage of total revenues will increase in future periods as additional stores open.
844161_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We anticipate revenues will fluctuate depending upon the number of new stores opened in any given period, as well as royalty fluctuations based on seasonal demand, brand offerings, promotions and the number of existing stores open.
844161_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016:
844161_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our largest licensees in the United States in all periods presented were Target and Kohl s, which together contributed 47% and 57% of our total revenues for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, and 28% and 46% of our total revenues for the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	For all periods presented, Target had the exclusive rights to sell Cherokee branded products for all product categories in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the United States were lower during Fiscal 2017 at approximately $509.0 million, down from approximately $1.1 billion in each of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	Under our former license agreement with Target, Target paid us royalties based on a percentage of its sales of Cherokee branded products and a royalty rate that, for most product categories, reduced after Target achieved specified cumulative sales volume thresholds during each fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM7_P96_S3	Target also paid fixed royalty rates for Target s sales of Cherokee branded products in the adult merchandise category that were made by Target through its website (target.com) and sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category.
844161_17_ITEM7_P96_S4	In addition, under a separate license agreement with us, Target pays a fixed percentage of net sales of products bearing the Liz Lange brand in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Under the terms of our former license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand, Target was obligated to pay us a minimum annual royalty of $10.5 million, which applied to all sales of Cherokee branded products made by Target in the United States other than sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category (which products were subject to a separate minimum annual royalty payment of $0.8 million).
844161_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Our license agreement with Target for most Cherokee branded products expired on January 31, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues to Cherokee Global Brands until its expiration.
844161_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	Target has informed us that it has elected to not renew the Liz Lange license agreement, which expires on January 31, 2018 at the end of the current term, Target will continue to pay royalties to Cherokee Global Brands until the expiration of the agreement.
844161_17_ITEM7_P98_S3	Cherokee Global Brands has entered into a master license agreement with a third party for Liz Lange branded maternity products beginning in Fiscal 2019.
844161_17_ITEM7_P98_S4	Our ability to generate royalty revenues from other licensees and franchisees sufficient to replace Target s historical royalty payments to us is yet to be determined and we may experience decreased revenue levels as a result of the expiration of this relationship, particularly in the near term as our wholesale arrangements intended to replace our license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand begin to gain traction with new retailers and their consumer bases.
844161_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target, excluding sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada (through Target s discontinuation of operations in Canada) and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, were $10.5 million and $14.9 million in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, which accounted for 31% and 43% of our total revenues for the respective periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	as a result of the expiration of the Target license agreement at the end of Fiscal 2017, as Target began to transition away from sales of these products as the expiration of this license agreement approached.
844161_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	As of the end of Fiscal 2017, Kohl s had approximately 1,100 stores in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	Retail sales of Hawk Signature or Tony Hawk branded products at Kohl s totaled $64.6 million in Fiscal 2017, compared to $90.6 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P101_S2	Under our license agreement with Kohl s, Kohl s pays royalty revenues to us based on a percentage of its sales of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products.
844161_17_ITEM7_P101_S3	The minimum annual royalty payment applicable to our license agreement, as amended, with Kohl s for the Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands was $4.8 million prior to January 28, 2017 and $4.6 million for the remainder of the term, which applies to all sales of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	We entered into three additional license agreements (two during Fiscal 2017 and one during Fiscal 2018) for our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	The license agreements are for broad distribution of the brands in the United States for all retail, including specialty, mid-tier, regional, mass market, off-price and club retail.
844161_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Because retail sales did not exceed the contractual minimum guarantees in any of the periods presented, royalty revenues from our Hawk Signature brand at Kohl s remained flat at $4.8 million for all periods, which accounted for 14% of our total revenues for each of the respective periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars.
844161_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	As a consequence, any weakening of the U.S. dollar benefits us in that the total royalty revenues reported from our international licensees increases when the dollar weakens against applicable foreign currencies.
844161_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	Conversely, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against an international licensee s foreign currency results in lower royalty revenues from such licensee.
844161_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	The main foreign currencies we encounter in our operations are the Mexican Peso, the EURO, the Great British Pound, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	As the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable between Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017, the estimated cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2017 as compared to Fiscal 2016 was immaterial.
844161_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	Additionally, we generally record the sales of our international licensees and franchisees in U.S. dollars.
844161_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	We typically receive a schedule of retail sales on a monthly and/or quarterly basis from each of our foreign licensees and franchisees that is denominated in their applicable foreign currency, and then we convert these amounts to U.S. dollars using the appropriate exchange rate for the purpose of disclosing all retail sales in U.S. dollars.
844161_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	For all periods, we do not consider the period to period fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to have had a significant effect on the accuracy of the U.S. dollar denominated figures presented in this Annual Report.
844161_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Our royalty revenues from Asia and Latin America are generated from licensees in Japan, China, Mexico, Peru, Chile, India, and other territories.
844161_17_ITEM7_P108_S1	Royalty revenues from licensees in Asia and Latin America increased to $7.3 million in Fiscal 2017 from $6.4 million in Fiscal 2016, representing a 13.1% increase.
844161_17_ITEM7_P108_S2	This increase was principally due to increased revenues from Japanese licensees in Fiscal 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	In local currencies, most of our licensees in Asia and Latin America experienced growth in retail sales across all periods presented.
844161_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	United Kingdom, Europe and Others .
844161_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	Our other international royalty revenues are generated from licensees in the United Kingdom, other countries in Europe and other territories.
844161_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	One of our more significant European licensees is Argos, a subsidiary of Home Retail Group plc, which launched a broad assortment of Cherokee lifestyle products online, in catalogs and in more than 750 Argos stores across the United Kingdom and Ireland in late July 2015 and began generating royalties to us during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P110_S3	Royalty revenues from licensees in Europe and other territories were relatively consistent at $2.7 million in Fiscal 2017 compared to $2.6 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	In addition, since the Hi-Tec Acquisition, we have been indirectly selling products bearing the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands to certain select wholesalers and government entities.
844161_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	In these arrangements, the purchasers of the products place their product orders directly with us, which we then forward to a manufacturer or distributor for the manufacture and delivery of the products directly to the original purchaser.
844161_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	The wholesalers and government entities that purchase products under these arrangements submit payments directly to us for their product orders, and we then remit a portion of these payments representing the product cost to the manufacturer or distributor of the purchased products.
844161_17_ITEM7_P111_S3	We began recording revenues from these relationships in December 2016 when we acquired these brands, and in Fiscal 2017, we recorded a total of $6.6 million in revenues from these indirect product sales.
844161_17_ITEM7_P111_S4	We maintain these indirect product sale relationships with a minimal portion of the customers of the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P111_S5	The indirect product sale arrangements subject us to certain risks, see item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	Cost of goods sold during Fiscal 2017 relates to payments remitted to manufacturers or distributors of purchased products that are sold to wholesalers and government entities as described earlier.
844161_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, were $35.2 million for Fiscal 2017, compared to $21.3 million for Fiscal 2016, representing an increase of $13.8 million.
844161_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	The increase in SG A was primarily due to the $11.5 million of additional legal, due diligence costs, integration and other costs related to the Hi-Tec acquisition and increased business development costs related to the identification and establishment of new brand licensees in the U.S. Selling, general and administrative expenses also included operating costs for Hi-Tec during the period from December 2016 through January 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	We also incurred restructuring charges of $3.8 million related to the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P115_S1	Restructuring charges consisted of severance, contract termination and other restructuring-related costs.
844161_17_ITEM7_P115_S2	Contract termination costs consist primarily of costs that will continue to be incurred under operating leases for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company, offset by any sublease income to be received thereafter.
844161_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	Our interest income and other income for Fiscal 2017 was $0.4 million, compared to $0.2 million for Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2017 was $1.7 million, compared to $0.7 million for Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	For Fiscal 2017, we recorded a tax provision of $3.3 million, compared to $4.4 million for Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P117_S1	Our effective tax rate was 69.8% for Fiscal 2017 and 34.1% for Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P117_S2	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 in comparison to Fiscal 2016 was primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs related to the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P117_S3	Since the transaction costs exceeded the Fiscal 2017 pretax book loss, the result was a significant fluctuation in the Fiscal 2017 effective tax rate.
844161_17_ITEM7_P117_S4	In addition, the Fiscal 2016 effective tax rate included a benefit for recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon the conclusion of certain income tax examinations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Our net loss for Fiscal 2017 was $7.9 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $8.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P118_S1	Our loss was primarily driven by acquisition costs and restructure charges incurred in connection with the Hi-Tec acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	In Fiscal 2016, our revenues totaled $34.7 million, compared to $35.0 million in Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P119_S1	Revenues for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 were primarily generated from licensing our trademarks to retailers and, to a lesser extent, to wholesalers, our share of licensing revenues from brand representation licensing agreements with other brand owners and, in the third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2016, franchise fees and royalty revenues received from franchisees of our Flip Flop Shops brand.
844161_17_ITEM7_P119_S2	The decrease in revenues was primarily related to the closing of Target Canada and the transition from Tesco to Argos, in addition to the effect of foreign exchange rates on international royalties.
844161_17_ITEM7_P119_S3	This decrease was partially offset by revenues from the October 2015 acquisition of Flip Flop Shops.
844161_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	Our Cherokee brand accounted for approximately 74% and 76% of our aggregate royalty revenues in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	Total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled $368.0 million and $381.0 million in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P120_S2	For Fiscal 2016, total worldwide retail sales of merchandise bearing the Cherokee brand totaled approximately $1.3 billion, versus $1.4 billion in total retail sales reported for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	The following table sets forth our revenues by brand for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015:
844161_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following table sets forth our geographic licensing revenues for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014:
844161_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Our largest licensees in the U.S. generally are Target and Kohl s, which together contributed 46% and 57% of our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and for Fiscal 2016, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	In Canada, we are transitioning from Target Canada to Sears Canada for our Cherokee and Liz Lange brands.
844161_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	As of the end of Fiscal 2016 Target had approximately 1,790 stores in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	Retail sales of Cherokee branded products at Target in the U.S. were flat in Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, at approximately $1.1 billion.
844161_17_ITEM7_P124_S2	In Fiscal 2016, Target reached the minimum annual royalty payment of $10.5 million during the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S., excluding sales of Cherokee branded products in Canada and Cherokee branded products sold in the school uniforms category, were $14.9 million in Fiscal 2016 and $15.0 million in Fiscal 2015, which accounted for 43%, and 43%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues during such periods.
844161_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	Target s U.S. retail sales of Cherokee branded products during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 totaled $296.8 million, compared to $314.1 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, decreasing by approximately 5.5%.
844161_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target U.S. were $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015, decreasing by approximately 2%.
844161_17_ITEM7_P126_S2	The revenues decreased slightly between periods due to a decline in retail sales for the quarter.
844161_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	As of the end of Fiscal 2016 Kohl s had approximately 1,200 stores in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	Retail sales of Hawk Signature or Tony Hawk branded products at Kohl s totaled $90.6 million in the Fiscal 2016 compared to $119.6 million in Fiscal 2015, decreasing approximately 24.2%.
844161_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	Because retail sales did not exceed the contractual minimum guarantees, royalty revenues from our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands at Kohl s remained flat between periods at $1.2 million and $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2016 respectively, which accounted for 15% and 14% of our consolidated revenues for such periods, respectively.
844161_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	Other international royalty revenues in Fiscal 2016 increased to $9.4 million from $8.9 million in Fiscal 2015, representing a 4.8% increase.
844161_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	This total includes licensees in Japan, China, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Israel, Chile, India and other territories.
844161_17_ITEM7_P128_S2	The increase was principally due to strength in Japan, China, India and South Africa, offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
844161_17_ITEM7_P128_S3	In local currencies, the majority of our international licensees had growth in retail sales for Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P128_S4	As the U.S. dollar strengthened between periods, the estimated cumulative effect on our revenues of changes to applicable foreign currency exchange rates during Fiscal 2016 in comparison to Fiscal 2015 was an approximate $0.8 million decrease.
844161_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	The following table sets forth additional detail regarding the components for selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, were $21.3 million for Fiscal 2016, compared to $19.6 million for Fiscal 2015, representing an increase of $1.7 million.
844161_17_ITEM7_P130_S1	The increase in SG A was primarily due to additional legal and due diligence costs related to potential and completed acquisitions, an increase in stock-based compensation, increased business development costs related to the identification and establishment of new brand licensees in the U.S. and the costs associated with Flip Flop Shops.
844161_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	Our interest income for Fiscal 2016 was $0 million, compared to $0 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	Our interest expense for Fiscal 2016 was $0.7 million, compared to $0.8 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	For Fiscal 2016, we recorded a tax provision of $4.4 million, compared to $4.7 million for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	Our effective tax rate was 34.1% for Fiscal 2016 and 32.4% for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	The difference in the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 in comparison to Fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits upon the conclusion during Fiscal 2016 of certain income tax examinations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Our net income for Fiscal 2016 was $8.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $9.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	On January 28, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.4 million.
844161_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	On January 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 million.
844161_17_ITEM7_P134_S2	On January 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.6 million.
844161_17_ITEM7_P134_S3	During Fiscal 2017, cash provided by operations was $12.1 million, compared to $11.9 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	During Fiscal 2017, cash used in investing activities was $73.8 million, compared to $13.4 million in Fiscal 2016.

844161_17_ITEM7_P137_S1	We had borrowings of $45 million, from a new credit facility with Cerebrus and $5 million from an unsecured receivables funding loan from Jess Ravich, the Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors incurred in connection with the Hi-Tec acquisition, and loan payments of $25 million in Fiscal 2017, compared to loan payments of $7.6 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_17_ITEM7_P137_S2	Also in connection with the Hi-Tec acquisition, in Fiscal 2017, we had net proceeds of $37 million from a public offering.
844161_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	During Fiscal 2016, cash received from financing activities was $0.5 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.8 million in Fiscal 2015.

844161_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	In September 2012, we entered into a credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	The terms of the JPMorgan credit facility included various restrictions and covenants regarding the operation of our business and financial covenants that set financial standards we must maintain.
844161_17_ITEM7_P139_S2	As collateral for the JPMorgan credit facility, we granted a security interest in favor of JPMorgan in all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness was guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiaries.
844161_17_ITEM7_P139_S3	See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information about our JPMorgan credit facility.
844161_17_ITEM7_P139_S4	As described below, as of the date of this report, all amounts owed under the JPMorgan credit facility have been repaid and the credit agreement, together with all term notes and the revolving line of credit thereunder, have been terminated and cancelled.
844161_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	On December 7, 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility with Cerberus, pursuant to which we are permitted to borrow (i) up to $5.0 million under a revolving credit facility, and (ii) up to $45.0 million under a term loan facility.
844161_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	Also on December 7, 2016, we drew down $45.0 million under the Cerberus term loan facility and have used a portion of such borrowings to fund the Hi-Tec Acquisition, including the repayment of the outstanding indebtedness of Hi-Tec, and to repay all amounts owed under our JPMorgan credit facility.
844161_17_ITEM7_P140_S2	We expect to use the remaining amount of borrowings under the Cerberus credit facility for general working capital.
844161_17_ITEM7_P140_S3	Our borrowings under the Cerberus credit facility are subject to certain maintenance and other fees.
844161_17_ITEM7_P140_S4	The terms of the Cerberus credit facility include financial covenants that set financial standards we will be required to maintain and operating covenants that impose various restrictions and obligations regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain Cerberus s consent before we can take certain specified actions.
844161_17_ITEM7_P140_S5	As collateral for the Cerberus credit facility, we granted a first priority security interest in favor of Cerberus in substantially all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by our subsidiaries.
844161_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash flow generated from operations, cash and cash equivalents currently on hand, and up to $5.0 million of funds available to us pursuant to the revolving credit facility with Cerberus.
844161_17_ITEM7_P141_S1	We believe our cash flow from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents currently on hand and access to funds pursuant to the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and other commitments and otherwise support our operations for the next twelve months.
844161_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	Our license agreement with Target for most Cherokee branded products expired on January 31, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	revenues through the end of Fiscal 2017 until its expiration.
844161_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category will expire at the end of its current term on January 31, 2018, and will continue to generate revenues until its expiration.
844161_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	Our ability to generate cash from our other licensees and franchisees in replacement of Target s royalty payments on a long-term basis is yet to be determined.
844161_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	During Fiscal 2017, we entered into nine new wholesale licensing arrangements covering sales of products bearing our Cherokee brand in the United States.
844161_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	We anticipate that these wholesale licensing arrangements may generate different trends in our liquidity after they become effective.
844161_17_ITEM7_P144_S2	For example, these wholesale arrangements do not have minimum annual royalty obligations to the magnitude of our license agreement with Target and are not subject to reducing royalty rates throughout the year based upon cumulative sales levels.
844161_17_ITEM7_P144_S3	Thus, as we begin to receive royalty payments from these wholesale licensees and to the extent we pursue similar wholesale arrangements in the future, their lower minimum royalty obligations and consistent royalty rates could cause our cash flows from operating activities to be more strongly influenced by the seasonality of the retail business and thus subject to more material fluctuations between periods and, if retail sales volume for the Cherokee brand decreases and we were to become dependent upon minimum royalty obligations, could also cause our cash flows from operating activities to decline.
844161_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	We cannot predict our revenues and cash flows that will be generated from operations in future periods, and our revenues and cash flows could be materially lower than we expect.
844161_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	If our revenues and cash flows are lower than we anticipate, or if our expenses are higher than we anticipate, then we may not have sufficient cash available to fund our planned operations and we could fail to comply with the terms of our credit facility with Cerberus or our other contractual commitments.
844161_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	In that case, we may need to take steps to reduce expenditures by scaling back operations and reducing staff related to these activities or seek funds from other sources, which may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_17_ITEM7_P145_S3	See Item 1A, Risk Factors , for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	As of January 28, 2017, we were not the guarantor of any material third party obligations and we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	Our cash requirements over the next twelve months are primarily to fund our operations and working capital, to make payments of principal and interest under our credit facility with Cerberus, at our discretion and subject to the terms of the credit facility, to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends as determined by our board of directors ( Board of Directors ), and, to a lesser extent, to fund capital expenditures.
844161_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately $44.6 million in principal amount of outstanding indebtedness owed under our credit facility with Cerberus, all of which is due in December 2021.
844161_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	We may seek to refinance all or a portion of this indebtedness before its maturity date.
844161_17_ITEM7_P148_S2	Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.
844161_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Pursuant to the approval of our Board of Directors, in June 2016 we repurchased and retired 60,082 shares of our common stock in open market transactions at a weighted average purchase price of $12.24 and for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $735,000.
844161_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	Further repurchases of our common stock or the declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock are subject to limited exceptions, subject to negative covenants contained in our credit facility and, assuming the satisfaction or waiver by Cerberus of such covenants, would be made solely at the discretion of our Board of Directors and would be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_17_ITEM7_P149_S2	Additionally, should an established and marketable brand or similar equity property become available on favorable terms, we would consider using our liquidity to fund such an acquisition opportunity, subject to obtaining any consent required under our credit facility with Cerberus.
844161_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	The following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of January 28, 2017:
844161_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	For purposes of the above table, yearly periods were calculated to coincide with our fiscal years, meaning, for example, that the period covered by the column captioned Fiscal 2018 starts on January 29, 2017 and ends on February 3, 2018.
844161_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	Represents future minimum non cancelable lease payments through the expiration date with respect to the lease of our office and warehouse facilities and other equipment leases.
844161_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Represents future interest (based on current interest rates) and principal payments with respect to our credit facility with Cerberus and our receivables funding loan with Jess Ravich.
844161_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	The rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a material effect on our revenues and profits.
844161_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	Since most of our future revenues will be based upon a percentage of sales by our licensees and franchisees of products bearing our owned or represented trademarks, we do not anticipate that short term future inflation will have a material impact, positive or negative, on future financial results.
844161_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In relation to our credit facility with JPMorgan and our credit facility with Cerberus, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have had an immaterial impact on interest expense for Fiscal 2017.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We conduct business in various parts of the world.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As most of our international licensees are required to pay the royalty revenues owed to us in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in countries in which our licensees do business when they are converted to the U.S. dollar, and significant fluctuations in exchange rates could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For Fiscal 2017, revenues from international licensing activities comprised 47% of our total revenues.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	For Fiscal 2017, a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where our licensees operate would have negatively affected our revenues by approximately $1.9 million, which represents 4.7% of our total revenues reported for the period.
844161_17_ITEM7A_P2_S4	This amount is not considered to represent a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
844161_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
844161_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
844161_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
844161_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
844161_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 18, 2017 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

844161_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
844161_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Cherokee Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Cherokee Global Brands or the Company ) is in the business of marketing and licensing the Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, and Sideout and related trademarks and other brands it owns or represents, as well as marketing and franchising the Flip Flop Shops brand and conducting indirect product sales to select retailers and government entities that are customers of its Hi-Tec family of footwear brands.
844161_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	Cherokee Global Brands is one of the leading licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home products and accessories.
844161_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	On December 7, 2016, the Company closed a Share Purchase Agreement ( Hi-Tec Acquisition or SPA ) with Hi-Tec International Holdings BV ( Hi-Tec ) and simultaneous Asset Purchase Agreements ( APAs ) with various third parties, pursuant to which Cherokee Global Brands acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Hi-Tec for $87,252 in cash, excluding non-interest bearing liabilities assumed and capitalized transaction costs.
844161_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	Cherokee Global Brands created a legal entity entitled Irene Acquisition Company B.V. (the buyer ) to execute the transaction.
844161_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
844161_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
844161_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated during the consolidation process.
844161_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	The Company s fiscal year comprises a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31.
844161_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	The fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 ( Fiscal 2017 ), January 30, 2016 ( Fiscal 2016 ), and January 31, 2015 ( Fiscal 2015 ) each represent a 52-week period.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S1	The standard creates a five-step model for revenue recognition that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering contract terms and relevant facts and circumstances.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S2	The five-step model includes (1) identifying the contract, (2) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and (5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation has been satisfied.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S3	The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S4	During Fiscal 2017, the FASB issued additional clarification guidance on the new revenue recognition standard which also included certain scope improvements and practical expedients.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S5	The standard (including clarification guidance issued) is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.
844161_17_ITEM8_P15_S6	Early adoption is permitted for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
844161_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	The Company is primarily engaged in the business of marketing and licensing the brands it owns or represents, as well as marketing and franchising the Flip Flop Shops brand.
844161_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	These royalty revenues are recognized when earned.
844161_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	To date, the Company has performed a preliminary detailed review of key contracts and compared historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard.
844161_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	The Company plans to adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 and is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
844161_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and requires additional disclosures if certain criteria are met.
844161_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods ending after December 15, 2016.
844161_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	The Company has adopted this guidance as of Fiscal 2017 and it did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
844161_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing guidance for off-balance sheet treatment of a lessees operating leases.
844161_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities related to long-term leases that were classified as operating leases under previous guidance in its balance sheet.
844161_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	An asset would be recognized related to the right to use the underlying asset and a liability would be recognized related to the obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease.
844161_17_ITEM8_P19_S3	The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding leases.
844161_17_ITEM8_P19_S4	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after January 1, 2019.
844161_17_ITEM8_P19_S5	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements is still being evaluated, but the Company expects there will be a significant increase in its long-term assets and liabilities resulting from the adoption.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	This guidance addresses the accounting for income tax effects at award settlement, the use of an expected forfeiture rate to estimate award cancellations prior to the vesting date and the presentation of excess tax benefits and shares surrendered for tax withholdings on the statement of cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	This guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S3	This is a change from the current guidance that requires such activity to be recorded in paid-in capital within stockholder s equity.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S4	This guidance will be applied prospectively and may create volatility in the Company s effective tax rate when adopted depending largely on future events and other factors which may include the Company s stock price, timing of stock option exercises, the value realized upon vesting or exercise of shares compared to the grant date fair value of those shares and any employee terminations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S5	This guidance also eliminates the requirement to estimate forfeitures, but rather provides for an election that would allow entities to account for forfeitures as they occur.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S6	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and will be adopted by the Company for Fiscal 2018.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S7	Upon adoption of the standard, the Company will record the tax effect of equity issuances within the income statement rather than paid-in capital.
844161_17_ITEM8_P20_S8	The Company expects the impact to the Company s results of operations to be immaterial.
844161_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that reduces the diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	This guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for early adoption.
844161_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which amends the accounting for income taxes on intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
844161_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	This guidance requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
844161_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	The income tax consequences on intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party.
844161_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
844161_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Early adoption is permitted at the beginning of a fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	On November 17, 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
844161_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	December 15, 2017 and allows for early adoption.
844161_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements is still being evaluated.
844161_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	On January 5, 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which modifies guidance for determining whether a transaction involves the purchase or disposal of a business or an asset.
844161_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	The amendments clarify that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets, the set of assets and activities is not a business.
844161_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted for transactions which have not been previously reported in consolidated financial statements that have been issued.
844161_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company has early adopted this guidance as of Fiscal 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Hi-Tec.
844161_17_ITEM8_P26_S4	Additionally, the Company currently anticipates that the guidance may result in future brand acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions instead of business combinations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P26_S5	Please refer to Note 3 for further information on the Hi-Tec acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify the testing for goodwill impairment by removing step two from the goodwill testing.
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Under current guidance, if the fair value of a reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount (step one), an entity would calculate an impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (step two).
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill was calculated by deducting the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the respective reporting unit from the reporting unit s fair value as determined under step one.
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	This guidance instead provides that an impairment charge should be recognized based on the difference between a reporting unit s fair value and its carrying value.
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S3	This guidance also does not require a qualitative test to be performed on reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S4	However, entities need to disclose any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts that have goodwill and the amount of goodwill allocated to each.
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S5	This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM8_P28_S6	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Receivables are reported at amounts the Company expects to be collected, net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
844161_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, such as historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company s licensees or franchisees, current economic conditions, bankruptcy, and other factors that may affect the Company s licensees or franchisees ability to pay.
844161_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	The allowance for doubtful accounts was $481 as of January 28, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	There was no allowance for doubtful accounts as January 30, 2016.
844161_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, deferred revenue, income taxes, valuation of intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation and stock-based compensation.
844161_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Management bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions about future events.
844161_17_ITEM8_P31_S3	These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
844161_17_ITEM8_P31_S4	By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_17_ITEM8_P31_S5	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased and money market funds purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents, if applicable.
844161_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	At January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, the Company s cash and cash equivalents exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) limits.
844161_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
844161_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	Revenues from royalty and brand representation agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractual royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data received from the Company s licensees.
844161_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company's royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royalties in the quarter earned, although a large portion of such royalty payments are actually received during the month following the end of a quarter.
844161_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Revenue from the indirect product sales are recognized when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, and the sales price is fixed or determinable.
844161_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Company s former license agreement with Target Corporation ( Target ) covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States accounted for a large portion of the Company s historical revenues.
844161_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	This agreement was structured to provide royalty rate reductions for sales of most products covered by the agreement after Target achieved certain cumulative sales volume thresholds, such that revenue was recognized by applying the reduced royalty rates prospectively to point of sale data for these products after the defined sales thresholds were exceeded for the remainder of applicable fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	Due to the terms of this license agreement, the amount of Cherokee brand royalty revenues earned by the Company from Target in any quarter has been dependent not only on Target s retail sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States in each quarter, but also on the royalty rate then in effect after considering Target s cumulative sales volume for most Cherokee branded products in the United States for the fiscal year.
844161_17_ITEM8_P35_S3	Historically, this has caused the Company to record its highest revenues and profits in its first quarter and its lowest revenues and profits in its fourth quarter.
844161_17_ITEM8_P35_S4	However, this trend did not continue in Fiscal 2017 and may not continue in future fiscal years due to the expiration of the Target license agreement at the end of Fiscal 2017.
844161_17_ITEM8_P35_S5	Any continuation of the Company s historical revenue and profit patterns or development of any new revenue or profit patterns will depend on, among other things, the terms of the Company s existing license and franchise agreements, excluding the Target license agreement, the terms of any new license or franchise agreements, and retail sales volumes achieved by the Company s licensees and franchisees.
844161_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Revenues from arrangements involving license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which are received or billable by the Company in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of the Company, are deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Deferred revenues also represent minimum licensee revenue royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non refundable to the licensee.
844161_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	Deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods in accordance with the license agreement.
844161_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Franchise revenues includes royalties and franchise fees.
844161_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Royalties from franchisees are based on a percentage of net sales of the franchisee and are recognized as earned.
844161_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	Initial franchise fees are recorded as deferred revenue when received and are recognized as revenue when a franchised location commences operations, as all material services and conditions related to the franchise fee have been substantially performed upon the location opening.
844161_17_ITEM8_P37_S3	Renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue when the franchise agreements are signed and the fee is paid, since there are no material services and conditions related to these franchise fees.
844161_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	In order to ensure that the Company s licensees and franchisees are appropriately reporting and calculating royalties owed to the Company, all of the Company s license and franchise agreements include audit rights to allow Cherokee Global Brands to validate the amount of the royalties paid.
844161_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently audited or reported as an adjustment to the amounts due from licensees or franchisees is recognized in the reporting period in which the differences become known and are determined to be collectible.
844161_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company is responsible for the enforcement of its intellectual property and for pursuing third parties that are utilizing its assets without a license.
844161_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	As a result of these activities, from time to time, the Company may recognize royalty revenues that relate to infringements that occurred in prior periods.
844161_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	These royalty recoveries may cause revenues to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and may not occur in subsequent periods.
844161_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Licensing and franchising revenue is recognized gross of withholding taxes that are remitted by the Company s licensees and franchisees directly to their local tax authorities.
844161_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Deferred financing costs and debt discounts are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the life of the debt.
844161_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
844161_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
844161_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or retired are written off, and the resulting gains or losses are included in current operations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset.

844161_17_ITEM8_P43_S3	The Company intends to renew these registrations, as appropriate, prior to expiration.
844161_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company monitors on an ongoing basis unauthorized uses of the Company s trademarks, and relies primarily upon a combination of trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect the Company s intellectual property rights domestically and internationally.
844161_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Trademark registration and renewal fees are capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
844161_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Trademark acquisitions are capitalized and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or are capitalized as indefinite-lived assets, if no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit their useful lives to Cherokee Global Brands.
844161_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Trademarks are evaluated for the possibility of impairment at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
844161_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	Franchise agreements have been treated as finite-lived and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the agreements.
844161_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Franchise agreements are evaluated for the possibility of impairment at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
844161_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
844161_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value.
844161_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	This determination is made at the reporting unit level which may be either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information is available.
844161_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	Two or more reporting units within an operating segment may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics.
844161_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Based on this analysis, the Company may determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
844161_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the amount of any impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit is determined using two steps.
844161_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	First, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the fair value hierarchy.
844161_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	These inputs include selection of an appropriate discount rate and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles over the implied fair value.
844161_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company has acquired material intangible assets in connection with business combinations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	These intangible assets consist primarily of brands and distributor relationships.
844161_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination.
844161_17_ITEM8_P53_S3	These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from intangible asset groupings and developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present value of cash flows.
844161_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of certain tangible assets such as inventory.
844161_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Company believes the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and other tangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.
844161_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
844161_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows:
844161_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments.
844161_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Long term debt approximates fair value due to the variable rate nature of the debt.
844161_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Long lived assets that will no longer be used in the business are written off in the period identified, since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the Company.
844161_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	Long-lived assets that will continue to be used by the Company need to be evaluated for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
844161_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	This evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections.
844161_17_ITEM8_P57_S3	These analyses involve management judgment based on various estimates and assumptions.
844161_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
844161_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The estimated undiscounted cash flows used for this nonrecurring fair value measurement are considered a Level 3 input, which consist of unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.
844161_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	These inputs would be based on the best information available, including the Company s own data.
844161_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	To date, there has been no impairment of long-lived assets.
844161_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
844161_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	A tax position is to be initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	Such tax positions are to be initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables.
844161_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	Cherokee Global Brands limits credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with quality financial institutions.
844161_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	At January 28, 2017, January 30, 2016 and January 31, 2015, the Company s cash and cash equivalents exceeded FDIC limits.

844161_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company is exposed to risks relating to maintaining foreign currencies.
844161_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	See Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are minimal due to the limited amount of open receivables and due to the nature of the Company s licensing business.
844161_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support licensee receivables.
844161_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	One licensee, Target, accounted for approximately 13% and 43%, respectively, of trade receivables at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 and approximately 39%, 53% and 53%, respectively, of revenues during Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	Another licensee, Kohl s, accounted for approximately 5% and 16% of trade receivables at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 and approximately 14% of revenues during Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015.
844161_17_ITEM8_P65_S4	Additionally, one Hi-Tec customer, Denstock Australia, accounted for approximately 17% of trade receivables at January 28, 2017.

844161_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company provides marketing expense money to certain large licensees based upon sales criteria to help them build the Company s licensed brands in their respective territories, thus providing an identifiable benefit to Cherokee Global Brands; the amounts paid for such marketing expenses during Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 were approximately $580, $389 and $222, respectively, and are included in the Company s total marketing, advertising and promotional costs.
844161_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
844161_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Diluted EPS is similar to the computation for basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
844161_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	However, nonvested restricted stock awards (referred to as participating securities) are excluded from the dilutive impact of common equivalent shares outstanding in accordance with authoritative guidance under the two class method, since the nonvested restricted stockholders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock as if the shares were fully vested and as a result, are deemed to be participating securities.
844161_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Under the two class method, earnings attributable to nonvested restricted stockholders are excluded from net earnings attributable to common stockholders for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share.
844161_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Shares of nonvested restricted stock have no material impact on the calculation under the two class method.
844161_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Authoritative guidance establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in consolidated financial statements.
844161_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	Comprehensive income (loss), as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period.
844161_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	For Fiscal 2017, the Company had a foreign currency translation adjustment of $33 included in comprehensive income.
844161_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	For Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, the Company had no comprehensive income components and accordingly, net income equaled comprehensive income.
844161_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	The local selling currency is typically the functional currency for all of the Company s international operations, and in certain cases the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
844161_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	In accordance with authoritative guidance, assets and liabilities of the Company s foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at period-end rates, while income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period.
844161_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currencies other than the Company s functional currency, including gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	Gains or losses related to transactions where settlement is anticipated, or those that result from the remeasurement of receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the Company s functional currency, are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	All long term assets are valued at their historical costs in U.S. dollars and therefore no gain or loss is recognized.
844161_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	All intercompany transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars and therefore there are no gains or losses recognized.
844161_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Repurchased shares of the Company s common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired.
844161_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	When the Company reissues treasury stock, and the proceeds from the sale exceed the average price that was paid by the Company to acquire the shares, the Company records such excess as an increase in additional paid in capital.
844161_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price the Company paid to acquire the shares, the Company records such difference as a decrease in additional paid in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded, with the balance recorded as a decrease in retained earnings.
844161_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Additionally, if treasury stock is retired, the excess of the repurchase price for the shares over their par value is recorded as a decrease in retained earnings.
844161_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	When a lease includes lease incentives (such as a rent abatement) or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, rental expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and amounts payable under the lease is included in deferred rent and lease incentives in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
844161_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	For leasehold allowances, the Company records a deferred lease credit on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred lease credit as a reduction of rent expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the term of the lease.

844161_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	The fair value of stock options and other stock-based awards is estimated using option valuation models.
844161_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	These models require the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend rate, estimated life and estimated forfeitures of each award.
844161_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	The fair value of stock-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award, and the Company has elected to use the graded amortization method.
844161_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Company makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
844161_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	Inventories acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value upon acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	Purchased inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using a standard cost method.
844161_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	Standard cost consists of the direct purchase price of merchandise inventory, in-bound freight-related costs and customs or duties.
844161_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	Inventory as of January 28, 2017 is comprised of finished goods.
844161_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Management regularly reviews inventories and records valuation reserves for damaged and defective merchandise, merchandise items with slow-moving or obsolescence exposure and merchandise that has a carrying value that exceeds net realizable value.

844161_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Cost of goods sold relates to payments remitted to manufacturers or distributors of purchased products that are sold to wholesalers and government entities through indirect product sales.
844161_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	The wholesalers and government entities that purchase products submit payments directly to us for their product orders, and we then remit a portion of these payments representing the product cost to the manufacturer or distributor of the purchased products.
844161_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Restructuring charges consist of severance, contract termination and other restructuring-related costs.
844161_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	A liability for severance costs is typically recognized when the plan of termination has been communicated to the affected employees and is measured at its fair value at the communication date.
844161_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Contract termination costs consist primarily of costs that will continue to be incurred under operating leases for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company, offset by any sublease income to be received thereafter.
844161_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	A liability for contract termination costs is recognized at the date the Company ceases using the rights conveyed by the lease contract and is measured at its fair value, which is determined based on the remaining contractual lease rentals reduced by estimated sublease rentals.
844161_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	A liability for other restructuring-related costs is measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred.
844161_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company issued warrants to purchase 120,000 shares of Cherokee Global Brands common stock in connection with the Hi-Tec customer license agreement with Carolina Footwear Group, LLC (see Note 3).

844161_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	The Company accounts for these warrants under ASC 505-50 Equity-based payments to non-employees .
844161_17_ITEM8_P89_S3	Because the warrants are assessed to be equity in nature, they are measured at fair value at inception.
844161_17_ITEM8_P89_S4	The warrants are recognized in APIC and contra revenue over the period the related revenue from the license is expected to be recognized, in accordance with ASC 605-60-25 and ASC 505-50-S99-1.
844161_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	For the year ended January 28, 2017, the Company determined the fair value of the stock warrants to be $567.
844161_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	During the year ended January 28, 2017, the Company recognized contra-revenue and additional paid in capital of $7, related to the amortization of the deferred warrant expense.

844161_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	Assembled work force was valued by estimating the value of the employees in place as of the date of valuation.
844161_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	This estimation was performed by determining on a replacement cost basis, the costs to locate, screen, interview, hire and train new employees in their new positions.
844161_17_ITEM8_P108_S2	Fair value amounts for the intangible assets were determined using inputs observed at the level 3 fair value hierarchy, and leases and inventory were observed at level 2.

844161_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 28, 2017, as a result of the material weaknesses described under Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting below.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadwa y Commission (2013).
844161_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their evaluation of internal control over financial reporting during the first year after the acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	As described elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are in the process of integrating the newly acquired Hi-Tec, Magnum and other associated footwear brands into our operations, including our overall internal control over financial reporting.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	As a result, management excluded Hi-Tec Sports International Holdings B.V. ( Hi-Tec Holdings ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cherokee Inc. that was acquired in December 2016 in the Hi-Tec Acquisition (as defined in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), from the scope of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and from this management report on the effectiveness of such internal controls.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Hi-Tec Holdings represented 16% and 19% of our total assets and total revenues, respectively, at the end of and for Fiscal 2017.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P3_S4	See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	In conducting the evaluation described above, management concluded that, as of January 28, 2017, the matters described below represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	The material weaknesses identified in management s evaluation are as follows:
844161_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Management concluded there was a material weakness in the design and operation of controls over our closing processes in connection with the consolidation of the newly acquired Hi-Tec operations.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P6_S0	In the Hi-Tec Acquisition, we acquired Hi-Tec Holdings, a private Netherlands company, along with its operating subsidiaries, which are organized in a number of other jurisdictions.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Neither Hi-Tec Holdings nor any of its subsidiaries has been required to file reports with the SEC or any equivalent international agency or prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) in any prior reporting period.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P6_S2	As a result, these entities lacked sufficient internal personnel and other resources with relevant experience and expertise to prepare financial statement in conformity with US GAAP.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	oversight of the Hi-Tec financial reporting personnel in time to meet its external financial reporting deadlines.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Application of Purchase Accounting Rules .
844161_17_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management also concluded there was a material weakness in controls over our application of purchase accounting principles under US GAAP in connection with the Hi Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P8_S2	As described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, the Hi-Tec Acquisition was a complex transaction involving our acquisition of the equity of Hi-Tec Holdings and the contemporaneous sale of a substantial majority of Hi-Tec Holdings operating assets.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P8_S3	The nature and the complexity of the series of contemporaneous transactions that constituted the Hi-Tec Acquisition resulted in difficulties applying the applicable purchase accounting rules and therefore affected our business combination controls, which was a significant contributing factor to the delay in the Company s finalization of its consolidated financial statements for the period.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P9_S0	As a result of these material weaknesses and based on the evaluation described above, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 28, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, however, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with US GAAP.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Our management, with the oversight of our Audit Committee, has developed and initiated a plan to enhance our control procedures with respect to the material weaknesses described above.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P10_S1	This remediation plan includes the following:
844161_17_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We believe our material weaknesses are largely due to a lack of appropriate personnel and other resources dedicated to our Hi-Tec operations.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P11_S1	As a result, our remediation plan commenced with an assessment of the financial and accounting resources for these operations in order to identify the areas and functions that lack sufficient personnel and other resources.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P12_S0	We intend to hire additional personnel, located in the Netherlands, to be dedicated to the implementation, maintenance and monitoring of disclosure and financial controls for our Hi-Tec operations, including our current efforts to recruit a US GAAP-trained controller for the Hi-Tec operations.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Increased Use of Third-Party Advisors .
844161_17_ITEM9A_P13_S1	We have engaged third-party advisors with appropriate expertise to assist with establishing and implementing financial and disclosure controls that are appropriate for our Hi-Tec operations and consistent with our obligations as a U.S. publicly traded company.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P13_S2	These third-party advisors include accounting experts and consultants with internal control expertise.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P14_S0	Completion of Post-Acquisition Integration Efforts .
844161_17_ITEM9A_P14_S1	Since completion of the Hi-Tec Acquisition, we are making significant post-acquisition integration efforts to convert the acquired assets to our brand licensing model.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P14_S2	For financial and accounting purposes, these efforts involve converting Hi-Tec Holdings financial, accounting and reporting controls and other related procedures to reflect the sale and separation of this entity s former operating assets and to integrate the acquired entity and the retained assets into our existing procedures for a brand licensing business.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P14_S3	We expect these financial and accounting integration efforts to be completed by the end of Fiscal 2018, and we anticipate the control deficiencies relating to this integration to be remediated in connection with the integration process and upon its completion.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Although we believe the steps we have already taken to date to implement this remediation plan have improved the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we have not completed these corrective processes and procedures.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P16_S0	fairly stated in all material respects.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P16_S1	If the remedial measures described above are insufficient to address any of the identified material weaknesses or are not implemented effectively, or if additional deficiencies or weaknesses arise in the future, there could be material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements or we could be delinquent in filing additional reports with the SEC.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P16_S2	The existence of material weaknesses and any failure to timely and effectively remediate them could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our reported financial information, adversely affect our reputation, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, and have the other effects described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P17_S0	Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm that has audited the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included on the following page of this Annual Report.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P18_S0	Except for those matters discussed in this Item 9A, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P19_S0	We have audited Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
844161_17_ITEM9A_P19_S1	Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P19_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P20_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
844161_17_ITEM9A_P20_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P20_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P20_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P21_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P21_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P22_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P22_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P23_S0	As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Hi-Tec International Holdings BV ( Hi-Tec ) and its subsidiaries, which was acquired during the year and constituted $27.2 million and $1.0 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of January 28, 2017 and $7.8 million and $4.1 million of revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P23_S1	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Hi-Tec and its subsidiaries.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P24_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P24_S1	The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P25_S0	Management has identified a material weakness in the Company s internal controls over the consolidation of the newly acquired Hi-Tec business.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P25_S1	Management also identified a material weakness in the Company s internal controls over the business combination process related to the application of purchase accounting principles under US GAAP in connection with the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P26_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2017.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P26_S1	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2017 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated May 18, 2017, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
844161_17_ITEM9A_P27_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.

844161_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	This certification has not been, and shall not be deemed, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
844161_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Cherokee Global Brands is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns, licensing Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, Sideout and others, which are licensed in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	As part of our business strategy, we also regularly evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	We believe the strength of our brand portfolio and platform of design, product sourcing and marketing capabilities has made us one of the leading global licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home products and accessories.
844161_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	We have licensing relationships with recognizable retail partners in their global locations to provide them with the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands, and we also have licensing relationships with manufacturers and distributors for the manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	In addition, we have relationships with franchisees that operate Flip Flop Shops retail stores located worldwide.
844161_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	As a brand marketer and manager, we do not directly sell product ourselves.
844161_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	Rather, we earn royalties when our licensees and franchisees sell licensed products bearing the trademarks that we own.
844161_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	We provide our licensees with access to our proprietary 360-degree platform and believe that our retail responsiveness process and 360-degree value proposition have allowed Cherokee Global Brands to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of the wholesalers and retailers that sell our portfolio of lifestyle brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that we continually measure, evaluate and incorporate into our 360-degree platform, we believe Cherokee Global Brands has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.
844161_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	We believe our licensing partners rely on our vision , which defines the growth potential and trajectories of our brands, the agility we afford to them through our 360-degree platform, which is designed to quickly seize opportunities and integrate new innovations, and the opportunity to realize global, multi-channel, multi-category scale through our portfolio of lifestyle brands and our platform capabilities.
844161_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	As of February 3, 2018, we had 54 continuing license agreements in approximately 80 countries, 42 of which pertained to brands in our Cherokee Global Brands segment and 12 of which pertained to our recently acquired Hi-Tec portfolio of brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P3_S4	These arrangements include relationships with Walmart, Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Nishimatsuya, Big 5, Academy, JD Sports, Black s and Lidl.
844161_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	In Direct to Retail licensing, or DTR licensing, we grant retailers a territory or channel-specific license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.
844161_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	We collaborate with our licensees product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or expand the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.
844161_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	In several cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although many products are subject to our pre approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards and many of our licensees marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.
844161_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	We plan to continue to solicit new licensees using our DTR licensing model in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand this part of our business.
844161_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	We believe that the DTR licensing model generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering licensees the ability to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over competing retailers.
844161_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	The licensees generally directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating the licensor s exposure to inventory and manufacturing risk while allowing the licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
844161_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Many of the world s largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands based on the DTR licensing model.
844161_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	Examples of retailers participating in the DTR licensing model include Walmart, Target, Carrefour, Lidl, Kohl s and C A, among others.
844161_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our DTR licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that, for many retailers worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, accessory, footwear and home categories, including product development, design, merchandising, sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers themselves, who typically command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with their end consumers.
844161_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	We believe many of these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than by carrying only private label goods or by carrying only branded products obtained from third party vendors.
844161_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	We also believe many retailers may be able to achieve enhanced profitability with our DTR licensing model because it allows them to avoid the substantial marketing costs associated with establishing and maintaining an in store brand.
844161_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	We also license our brands to manufacturers and distributors based on wholesale arrangements.
844161_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Wholesale licensing arrangements generally involve licensing to manufacturers and distributors that produce and/or import various categories of apparel, accessories, footwear and home products under our trademarks and trademarks owned by third parties and sell the licensed products to retailers, which then resell the products to consumers.
844161_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Although our strategy has historically been focused primarily on the DTR licensing model, we have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands, and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements for the Cherokee, Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk and Liz Lange brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	In addition, we are primarily pursuing a wholesale licensing strategy for global sales of our recently acquired Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks and Interceptor brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	We believe these arrangements signal a significant shift in our business strategy, from our historical focus on DTR licensing for all of our brands to a substantially greater focus on wholesale licensing for many of our key brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P10_S3	We believe these wholesale licensing arrangements may help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and may provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, including an opportunity to further expand the reach of our brands in markets where a DTR licensing model may not be the most effective approach.
844161_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our franchise business involves licensing our Flip Flop Shops brand to third-party franchisees that operate retail stores under this brand name.
844161_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	In our franchising operations, we typically specify the products and services that will be offered by the franchisees, and also provide them with an operating system and other operational support.

844161_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Historically, the Cherokee brand s most significant licensee was Target, Corporation ( Target ), which licensed the Cherokee brand almost two decades ago and had exclusive rights in the United States to its multi category product offering that encompassed kid s apparel, accessories, footwear and school uniforms.
844161_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category expired on January 31, 2018, and our license agreement with Target covering sales of all other Cherokee branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2017.

844161_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Before the acquisition, these brands were owned and operated under a distribution model whereby the products bearing these brands were designed, contracted for manufacture, sold and distributed by the brand owner through retailers, independent distributors, licensees, government contracts and directly to consumers via e-commerce.
844161_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	We acquired the Hi-Tec brands with the objective of converting these operations to a brand licensing model that aligns with our operations.
844161_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	To accomplish this objective, we have sold all of the former sales and distribution operations for the Hi-Tec brands to third parties and entered into new wholesale licensing arrangements with these third parties, and we have retained all of the intellectual property for the Hi-Tec brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	We believe this brand licensing model conversion will allow us to better access the markets we think are best addressed by the Hi-Tec brands, more efficiently leverage cross-selling opportunities with our other brands, and more effectively expand the Hi-Tec brands into other product categories, such as apparel and accessories.

844161_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary depending on the terms of each licensing agreement.
844161_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	Generally, our DTR license agreements include royalty rates based on a percentage of the retailer s sales of licensed products.
844161_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	Some of our DTR license agreements provide for fixed royalty rates, and other DTR license agreements provide for royalty rates that may decrease or otherwise fluctuate during a year as the retailer achieves sales volume thresholds.
844161_18_ITEM1_P35_S4	For wholesale license agreements, royalty rates are generally based on a fixed percentage of wholesale sales from the wholesaler to the retailer or a fixed percentage of manufacturing costs.
844161_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	In some cases, we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum royalty payment to us each year, although the amount of this minimum payment can vary significantly from licensee to licensee and is typically lower for wholesale licensees than for DTR licensees.

844161_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period as defined in the applicable license agreement.
844161_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	To ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license agreements grant us the right to audit our licensees royalty reports to validate the amount of sales or purchases reported and royalties paid.
844161_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Each franchisee who operates a Flip Flop Shops retail location in the United States has a franchise agreement with us that generally provides franchise rights for each location for an initial term of 10 years and typically includes a 10-year renewal provision, subject to certain conditions as specified in the franchise agreement.
844161_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	The agreements provide the franchisee the rights to use the Flip Flop Shops brand name, trademarks and know-how in the operation of a Flip Flop Shops retail store.
844161_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Franchisees typically pay us an initial franchise fee and royalties based on a percentage of gross sales at each retail store.
844161_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	In certain non-U.S. markets, we may grant a master franchisee exclusivity to develop or sub-franchise a territory for a specified number of new Flip Slop Shops locations in the territory based on a negotiated schedule.
844161_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	In these instances, the master franchisee pays an initial master franchise fee, a per-location opening fee and a royalty fee based on a percentage of gross sales at the retail stores.
844161_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	We hold various trademarks, including Cherokee , Hi-Tec , Magnum , 50 Peaks , Interceptor , Hawk Signature , Tony Hawk , Liz Lange , Completely Me by Liz Lange , Flip Flop Shops , Everyday California , Carole Little , Saint Tropez-West , Chorus Line , All That Jazz , Sideout , Sideout Sport and others for numerous categories of apparel and other goods.
844161_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and we also hold trademarks or trademark applications for each of these brand names and others with similar government agencies in a number of other countries.
844161_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	Our trademark registrations typically expire after seven to ten years depending on the jurisdiction, although we intend, and expect to be able, to renew these trademarks for as long as we continue to use them.
844161_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	Our business is dependent on our trademarks, and we monitor unauthorized uses of these trademarks on an ongoing basis.
844161_18_ITEM1_P40_S4	In addition to trademarks, we also rely on know how, trade secrets and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights domestically and internationally.
844161_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Merchandise bearing our brand names and goods that are carried by Flip Flop Shops retail stores are subject to intense competition.
844161_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Competing brands with respect to our Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona and Route 66, and competing brands with respect to the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands include Columbia, Merrell, Keen, North Face, Timberland, Bates, Wolverine and other private label brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our other brands also face competition from these and other numerous brands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	Factors that shape the competitive environment for our brands include quality of garment or accessory construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to retailer and consumer demand.
844161_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers and wholesalers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers, engaging wholesalers to manufacture and distribute products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers, and entering into franchise relationships with Flip Flop Shops retail store owners.
844161_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of our brands, our licensees ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our franchisees ability to sell products in their stores, all of which is dependent on the ability of us, our licensees and our franchisees to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.
844161_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	In addition, we compete with companies that own other brands and trademarks, as these companies could enter into similar licensing arrangements with retailers and wholesalers in the United States and internationally.
844161_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	These arrangements could be with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention and limited floor or rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold, and vying with us for the time and resources of the retailers and wholesale licensees that manufacture and distribute our products.
844161_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Historically, our business and performance have been subject to certain seasonality trends, particularly due to our former license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand, which had a royalty rate that, for most product categories, reduced after Target achieved specified cumulative sales volume thresholds during each fiscal year, therefore resulting in higher revenues in the first part of our fiscal year and lower revenues in the latter part of our fiscal year.
844161_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	With the expiration of the Target license agreement at the end of Fiscal 2017, our business and performance no longer reflect this seasonality trend.
844161_18_ITEM1_P43_S2	Furthermore, if and to the extent royalty revenues grow from our new wholesale licensees, we expect our revenues may shift toward the latter half of our fiscal year, which would be consistent with the normal, holiday-based seasonal pattern of retail sales.
844161_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ) and various state laws regulate our Flip Flop Shops franchising activities.
844161_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	For instance, the FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement, and several states require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offerings and sales.
844161_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ) and any applicable foreign anti-bribery laws.
844161_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	We are also subject to various laws that are generally applicable to businesses in our industry, such as work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations.
844161_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	Our violation of any of these laws could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	As of February 3, 2018, we employed 60 persons.
844161_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
844161_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	After the Hi-Tec Acquisition, our reportable segments consist of Cherokee Global Brands and Hi-Tec.

844161_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause our stock price to decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our business is subject to intense competition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Merchandise bearing our brand names and goods that are carried by Flip Flop Shops retail stores are subject to intense competition.

844161_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We cannot control the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and changing preferences and trends may lead customers to purchase other products.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Further, we cannot control the level of resources that our licensees or franchisees commit to supporting our brands, and our licensees may choose to support products bearing other brands to the detriment of our brands because our agreements generally do not prevent them from licensing or selling other products, including products bearing competing brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, we compete with companies that own other brands and trademarks, as these companies could enter into similar licensing arrangements with retailers and wholesalers in the United States and internationally.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	These arrangements could be with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention and limited floor or rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold, and vying with us for the time and resources of the retailers and wholesale licensees that manufacture and distribute our products.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These companies may be able to respond more quickly to changes in retailer, wholesaler and consumer preferences and devote greater resources to brand acquisition, development and marketing.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We may not be able to compete effectively against these companies.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If we or our brands are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to sustain or increase demand for products bearing our brands, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, prospects, performance and financial condition.

844161_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There are numerous risks and other factors applicable to the businesses of retailers (including our DTR licensees and franchisees and retailers to which our wholesale licensees distribute products) that can impact the sale of products that bear our brands and, with respect to our franchisees, the sale of products bearing other brands that are sold in their stores.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Any decline in sales of our branded products by retailers could adversely affect our revenues.

844161_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If an event of default occurs under the credit facility that is not forborne, cured or waived in accordance with the terms of the credit facility, Cerberus has the right to terminate its obligations under the credit facility, accelerate the payment on any unpaid balance of the credit facility and exercise any other rights it may have, including foreclosing on our assets that serve as collateral for the loan.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As of the end of the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2018, we had failed to comply with certain of the financial and other covenants in the Cerberus credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Although Cerberus agreed to forbear from exercising its rights or remedies under the Cerberus credit facility with respect to these events of default for specified periods and ultimately agreed to waive these events of default, Cerberus may not agree to forbear or waive any future failure by us to fully comply with the terms of the credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	For instance, based on our current forecasts, we anticipate that we will violate certain of our financial covenants in the Cerberus credit facility (specifically, our covenant to maintain certain liquidity levels) within the next twelve months without an infusion of cash or an increase in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, which has caused an explanatory paragraph to be included in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in this Annual Report describing an uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The inclusion of this explanatory paragraph itself results in noncompliance with covenants in the Cerberus credit facility, and as a result, we are not in compliance with this credit facility as of the date of this Annual Report.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Additionally, in connection with Cerberus agreement to waive our prior events of default, Cerberus required that the credit facility be amended to, among other things, add new financial and other covenants with which we must comply, including maintaining certain liquidity levels, obtaining specified amounts of proceeds from equity financings and arranging for and effecting purchases by one or more third parties of participation interests in the credit facility, and Cerberus could again impose additional or more burdensome covenants or requirements in connection with any amendment or waiver we may be able to obtain related to our current and potential future compliance failures.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	These failures to comply with the Cerberus credit facility subject us to significant risks, including Cerberus s ability to exercise any of its rights upon the occurrence of an event of default.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	If any of these rights were to be exercised, our financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected and our ability to continue operations could be materially jeopardized.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Further, even if a waiver or amendment with respect to any future event of default could be obtained, we may be required to comply with more new covenants or other requirements as a condition to the waiver or amendment, which could impose burdensome obligations on our operations and financial condition that we may not be able to satisfy.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may seek to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness in the future.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and the state of our industry, business and financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms if or when desired or at all.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The amount of our outstanding indebtedness, which is substantial, could have an adverse effect on our operations and liquidity, including by, among other things: (i) making it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions, because we may not have sufficient cash flows to make our scheduled debt payments; (ii) causing us to use a larger portion of our cash flows to fund interest and principal payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, product development, capital expenditures and other business activities; (iii) making it more difficult for us to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities or other strategic transactions, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and (iv) limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund the activities and expenditures described above and for other general corporate purposes as and when needed, which could force us to suspend, delay or curtail business prospects, strategies or operations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our future capital needs may be uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, but such funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our capital requirements in future periods may be uncertain and could depend on many factors, including, among others: (i) acceptance of, and demand for, our brands; (ii) the extent to which we invest in our existing brand portfolio or any new brands; (iii) the number and timing of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions; (iv) the costs of developing new brands; (v) the costs associated with our efforts to expand our business; and (vi) the costs of litigation and enforcement activities to protect and defend our trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may need to raise additional funds to meet our capital requirements.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	For example, we expect to seek an increase in our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility with Cerberus or additional liquidity from other lenders in light of our current and forecasted compliance failures under the credit facility and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	However, these or any other necessary funds may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, as we did with our public offering of our common stock in December 2016 and our private placement equity financing with certain of our directors, officers and large stockholders in August 2017, our existing stockholders would experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If we incur additional debt to raise funds, as we did with our Cerberus credit facility established into in December 2016, we may become over-leveraged and we may become subject to restrictive financial or operating covenants that could limit our ability to operate our business and expose us to significant risks in the event of any compliance failure.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Moreover, in light of our current level of indebtedness, which is significant, and our current noncompliance with our indebtedness with Cerberus, additional debt or equity capital may not be available on terms we consider advantageous or favorable to us.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In addition, we may seek equity and/or debt financing from sources that expose us to additional risks or negative effects, such as, for example, obtaining funding from related parties in transactions that create conflicts of interest between us and the related party, as we did with our private placement in August 2017 mentioned above and our arrangement of purchases by certain of our directors, officers and large stockholders of participation interests in our Cerberus credit facility in December 2017.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital-raising transactions, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Moreover, our late filing of our annual report for Fiscal 2017 and our quarterly report for the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 renders us ineligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3, and we will not regain such eligibility until we have timely filed all of our periodic reports with the SEC for 12 consecutive calendar months.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We do not know when we will meet this requirement, which depends on our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we seek to raise capital through an offering of our securities while we remain ineligible to use Form S-3, our inability to use this form could limit our financing alternatives, reduce our ability to access capital in a timely manner and increase our transaction costs, any of which could make it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and could have an adverse effect on our prospects and financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we cannot raise funds when needed, on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to develop or enhance our brand portfolio or marketing initiatives, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or customer requirements.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any of these outcomes may materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our wholesale licensing arrangements subject us to a number of risks.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements in connection with a significant shift in our business strategy, from our historical focus on a DTR licensing model for all of our brands to a substantially greater focus on wholesale licensing for many of our key brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Although we believe our new wholesale licensing arrangements may have certain benefits, these arrangements are subject to a number of risks and our beliefs could turn out to be wrong.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If any of these risks occur and we do not achieve the intended or expected benefits of our strategy shift toward wholesale arrangements, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Moreover, we have less experience with the wholesale licensing model than the DTR licensing model and we may find it difficult to develop reliable forecasts and expectations regarding royalty revenues from these arrangements, either of which could harm our business and our operating results.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The terms of our wholesale licensing arrangements differ in certain important ways from the terms of our DTR licensing arrangements.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For instance, the minimum annual royalty obligations under our wholesale licensing arrangements are significantly smaller than the minimum annual royalty obligations in some of our DTR licensing arrangements, including our former license agreements with Target and Kohl s.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Also, our new wholesale license agreements for the Cherokee brand and the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands are not subject to reducing royalty rates based on cumulative sales levels, as was our former license agreement with Target for the Cherokee brand.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	These different terms could have a material impact on our performance.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	For example, the consistent royalty rates of these wholesale licensing arrangements could cause our performance and cash flows to be more strongly influenced by the seasonality of the retail business and thus subject to more material fluctuations between periods, and the lower minimum royalty obligations could cause our aggregate annual royalty revenues to decline if retail sales volume for our brands decreases and we become dependent on minimum royalty obligations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	These effects on our performance could become increasingly significant in future periods, to the extent our new wholesale licensees gain traction over time with new retailers and consumer bases and the proportion of our royalty revenues from these licensees increases, or if we pursue similar wholesale arrangements in the future.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Additionally, in wholesale licensing arrangements, we have limited ability to control various aspects of the manufacturing process, including access to raw materials, the timing of delivery of finished products, the quality of finished products and manufacturing costs.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our wholesale licensees may not be able to produce finished products of the quality or in the quantities that are sufficient to meet retailer and consumer demand in a timely manner or at all, which could result in an inability to generate revenues from any such products and loss of confidence in our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Interruptions or delays in the manufacturing process can occur at any time and for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control, including, among others, unforecasted spikes in demand, shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, backlogs, insufficient devotion of resources to the manufacture of products bearing our brands, or problems that may arise with manufacturing operations or facilities or our wholesale licensees businesses generally.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	On the other hand, our wholesale licensees may produce inventory in excess of retailer and consumer demand, in which case over-supply may cause retail prices of products bearing our brands to decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Further, we compete with other brand owners for the time and resources of our wholesale licensees, which could curtail or limit our ability to engage new or maintain relationships with existing wholesale licensee partners on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Further, the unplanned loss of any of our wholesale licensees could lead to inadequate market coverage for retail sales of products bearing our brands, create negative impressions of us and our brands with retailers and consumers, and add downward pricing pressure on products bearing our brands as a result of liquidating a former wholesaler s inventory of such products.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	The occurrence of any of these risks could adversely impact our reputation, performance and financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands and conversion of these brands to a new business model is subject to significant risks.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We recently acquired the Hi-Tec, Magnum and other associated footwear brands and completed our conversion of these brands from their former distribution model to a brand licensing model that aligns with our operations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Although we believe the acquisition of these brands and our conversion of their selling model may have certain benefits, the acquisition and conversion of these brands are subject to a number of risks and our beliefs could turn out to be wrong.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If any of these risks occur and we do not achieve the intended or expected benefits of our acquisition and conversion of these brands, we may never generate sufficient revenues from these brands to recoup their costs and our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Hi-Tec, Magnum and other associated footwear brands have not historically been marketed, distributed or sold under a brand licensing model, and it is uncertain whether this model will be effective for these brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, we may not be able to reliably forecast or predict the impact of these brands on our revenues or other aspects of our results of operations until they have been operated under a licensing model for some time.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Further, the roles and responsibilities of the various parties in the distribution chain for these products, including our Company, as the licensor of the brands and overseer of high-level marketing strategies, the wholesalers we engage to manufacture and distribute products bearing these brands, and the retailers to which the wholesalers sell these products for resale to consumers, are different as a result of our conversion of these brands to a brand licensing model.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Further, as we make efforts to expand these brands to new geographic and consumer markets, we expect to pursue new arrangements with additional wholesale licensees for these brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	However, any such efforts are subject to risks, including risks associated with engaging new licensees, which may not be willing or able to operate within a brand licensing model or generate material revenues to us under this model, and risks associated with expanding to new markets, which may consist of retailers and consumers who are unfamiliar with or unwilling to accept our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Any such outcome could result in failures to sell products bearing these brands in volumes and at prices that generate expected revenue levels to us.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Most of our royalty revenues are generated from retailers that manufacture and sell products bearing our brands in their stores and on their websites, and from wholesalers that manufacture and distribute products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, we generate royalty revenues from franchisees of the Flip Flop Shops brand based on sales of products in their stores.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Under our existing agreements, our licensees and franchisees pay us fees based on their sales of products or, for some of our wholesale licensees, based on their manufacturing costs.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As a result, we rely on our licensees and franchisees to accurately report their sales or costs in collecting our license and franchise fees, preparing our financial reports, projections and budgets and directing our sales and marketing efforts.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Although all of our agreements permit us to audit our licensees and franchisees, if any of them understate their sales or costs, we may not collect and recognize the royalty revenues to which we are entitled on a timely basis or at all, or we may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We utilize various licensing and selling models in our operations, and our success is dependent on our ability to manage these different models.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In addition to our historical focus on a DTR licensing model, we are shifting our focus for some of our key brands to a wholesale licensing strategy and we use a franchising model for our Flip Flop Shops brand.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Although we believe these various licensing and selling models could have certain benefits, these models could themselves be unsuccessful and our beliefs could turn out to be wrong.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Moreover, our pursuit of these different models could divert management s attention and other resources, including time and capital, from our historical focus on a DTR licensing strategy.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	As a result, our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully manage these multiple licensing and selling models.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If we are unable to do so, our performance, financial condition and prospects could be materially harmed.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our business continues to depend in part on the success of our Direct to Retail licensing model.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our DTR licensing model has been our historical focus and it continues to be an important part of our operations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We believe the DTR licensing model has become more widely accepted by many retailers worldwide, and our business plan is based in part on the success of this model with our existing retail licensees and with new retailers we may solicit to license our brands under this model in new territories and additional product categories.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	However, our beliefs regarding the DTR licensing model may turn out to be wrong, and it may not achieve or sustain increased acceptance or its use by retailers could decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If our existing or potential future retail licensees do not perceive the DTR licensing model to be advantageous to them, which could occur for a variety of reasons, they may move away from this model and pursue alternatives, such as purchasing from wholesalers or manufacturing private label products.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	In that event, this aspect of our business may prove unsuccessful and our financial condition and performance could suffer material adverse effects.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business has historically been largely dependent on royalties from Target and Kohl s, which no longer sell products bearing any of our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the past, Target has had exclusive rights to sell Cherokee and Liz Lange branded products for all product categories in the United States, and royalty revenues from Target s sales of these products accounted for a large portion of our revenues during Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and other historical periods.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	to sell Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products in all product categories in the United States, and royalty revenues from Kohl s sales of these products also accounted for a significant portion of our revenues during Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and other historical periods.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	However, our license agreements with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category and Liz Lange products expired on January 31, 2018, our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in all other categories expired on January 31, 2017, and our license agreement with Kohl s covering sales of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products expired on January 31, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	As a result, after January 31, 2018, Target and Kohl s no longer sell products bearing any of our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Replacing the royalty revenues received from Target and Kohl s is a significant challenge, due in part to the large size of these former licensees businesses and the significant amount of royalty revenues they have historically contributed to our results, as well as the difficulties of establishing relationships with new licensees generally, as they may have no prior experience with us or our brands and they may need to generate demand for our brands among entirely new retailer and consumer bases, which could take many years and involve significant costs.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Even though it is a normal part of our business to replace licensees whose arrangements with us have expired without renewal or have otherwise terminated, and even though we have entered into several new wholesale licensing agreements that are intended to replace, over time, the royalty revenue generated by our former license agreements with Target and Kohl s, the royalty revenues we receive from the new licensees may not in the near term, or ever, reach or exceed the royalty revenues earned under the previous relationships.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As a result, the expiration of these license agreements has had an adverse effect on our royalty revenues for these brands and our overall business and results in Fiscal 2018, and this effect could continue or worsen in future periods as the transition to our new licensees for these brands remains ongoing.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Moreover, as with all licensee replacements, the royalty revenues we receive from the new licensees may not in the near term, or ever, reach or exceed the royalty revenues earned under the previous relationships, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations over the long term.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The failure of our licensees or franchisees to sell products that generate royalties to us, to pay us royalties pursuant to their license or franchise agreements with us, or to renew these agreements could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our revenues are dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license and franchise agreements.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Although some of our license agreements guarantee a minimum royalty payment to us each year, the failure of our licensees or franchisees to satisfy these or the other obligations under their agreements with us, their decision to not renew their agreements with us or their inability to grow or maintain their sales of products bearing our brands or their businesses generally could cause our revenues to decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These events or circumstances could occur for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside our control, including business and operational risks that impact our licensees and franchisees ability to make payments and sell products generally, such as obtaining and maintaining desirable store locations and consumer acceptance and presence; retaining key personnel, including the specific individuals who work on sales and marketing for products bearing our brands; and liquidity and capital resources risks.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Further, while we historically have been dependent on our relationships with Target and Kohl s, the failure by any of our other key licensees or franchisees or the concurrent failure by several licensees or franchisees to meet their financial obligations to us or to renew their respective license or franchise agreements with us could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our franchise business exposes us to numerous risks.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In connection with our acquisition of the Flip Flop Shops brand in October 2015, we acquired, and became the franchisor under, a number of franchise agreements with franchisees of this brand.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Flop Shops retail stores located across the globe, including in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South Africa.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	inabilities to obtain adequate financing, attract qualified operating personnel or other factors; (iii) the third-party brands that are sold at Flip Flop Shops stores could decline in popularity or decide to stop selling their merchandise at some or all Flip Flop Shops store locations; (iv) neighborhood or economic conditions or other demographic patterns where existing or new Flip Flop Shops stores are located could decline or otherwise change in a negative way; and (v) our franchise business is subject to complex and varying franchise laws and regulations imposed by the U.S. federal and state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including regulation by the FTC, and we may need to devote significant costs and other resources to comply with these laws and regulations and we may be subject to various penalties, including monetary fines or other sanctions, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If any of these risks were to materialize, the reputation of the Flip Flop Shops brand and our other brands could suffer, sales volume at one or more Flip Flop Shops store locations could decline, existing store locations may close or new store locations may fail to open at expected rates or at all, or our franchise revenues relating to this brand could be limited, curtailed or reduced, any of which could harm our performance and prospects.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our business may be negatively impacted by general economic conditions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and the corresponding impact on levels of consumer spending, which may affect our licensees and franchisees retail sales.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	It is difficult to predict future levels of consumer spending, and any such predictions are inherently uncertain.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the industry in which we operate, including, among others, prevailing economic conditions; levels of employment, salaries and wage rates; energy costs; interest rates; the availability of consumer credit; tax rates; and consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Further, our industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles, as purchases of apparel, footwear, accessories and home products tend to decline in periods of economic uncertainty, slowdown or recession because disposable income typically declines during these periods.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	As a result, the risks associated with our business are generally more acute in these periods.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	For instance, general uncertainty in U.S. economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions has increased following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election due to the unpredictability of the policies and direction of the current administration, and these uncertainties may result in decreased confidence in the U.S. or global economy and decreased levels of consumer spending.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	In addition to decreased consumer spending generally, periods of uncertainty, slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for, or additional downward pricing pressure on, the products carrying our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	Accordingly, any prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or any other negative trend in the U.S. or global economy would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We are subject to additional risks associated with the international scope of our operations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Many of our licensees and franchisees are located outside the United States, and we aim to expand our international revenues.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, our business associated with our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands is managed and operated by our Dutch subsidiary.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	or region, particularly in emerging markets; (xii) potentially adverse tax consequences from the several U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation; and (xiii) cultural differences in the conduct of business.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Any one or more of these factors could cause our international revenues to decline or could cause us to fail to execute on our business strategy involving international expansion.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the FCPA and applicable foreign anti-bribery laws, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our international royalty revenues are typically denominated in U.S. dollars.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	However, because our international licensees and franchisees operate in other currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies have an impact on our royalty revenues, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The primary foreign currencies in which our licensees operate are the Euro, the Great British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Some of our licensees have contracts with government entities that are subject to unique risks.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Some of our licensees for our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands have, and expect to maintain, long-term contracts with various foreign government entities.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition to normal business risks, including the other risks discussed in these risk factors, our licensees contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our or their control.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	For instance, long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	As a result, the termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our licensees government contracts could result in a loss of anticipated future revenues from that contract, which could have a negative impact on our operations because our royalty revenues from the licensee attributable to the government contract would also cease.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In periods of global or local political tension or unrest or decreased spending, these risks could be amplified.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	In addition, government entities are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts at their convenience and without prior notice and would only be required to pay for work completed and commitments made at the time of the termination.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P52_S6	Any such modification, curtailment or termination of significant government contracts products bearing our Hi-Tec family of footwear brands could have a material adverse effect on our licensees sales of these products, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the strength of our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our success is dependent on the strength of our brands.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changes to consumer preferences and demands, which are subject to significant fluctuations, the strength of our brands may be impaired.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Even if we do react timely and appropriately to these changes, consumers may still consider one or more of our brands to be outdated or associated with styles that are no longer popular.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In the past, many companies in our industry have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and revenues followed by periods of declining sales and losses.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our business may be similarly affected.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We are dependent on our intellectual property rights, especially our trademarks, and we may not be able to successfully protect our rights or we may become involved in costly legal proceedings relating to these rights or the intellectual property rights of third parties.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our trademarks are vital to our business.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We hold various trademarks for our brand names, which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We also hold trademarks or trademark applications for our brand names with similar government agencies in a number of other countries, although the laws of many countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, adequate protection in these jurisdictions may be unavailable or limited in spite of our efforts to safeguard these rights.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, our efforts to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights might not prevent imitation of our brands or products bearing our brands, other infringement of our rights, challenges to our intellectual property ownership, the loss of license or franchise revenues or other negative effects.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	ability of our licensees and franchisees to effectively compete for market share.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	If any of these events were to occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In addition, in the future, we may decide to assert infringement claims against third parties, and one or more parties may assert infringement claims against us.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management and other personnel, whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Further, any adverse ruling in any such matter could reduce the value of our intellectual property assets and our licenses, which could result in limitations on our ability to market and license our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We may become involved in other litigation or government or administrative proceedings that may materially affect us.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action and other litigation and claims.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We may also be the subject of government and other regulatory investigations, audits and proceedings, including in connection with any claim of our violation of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business, such as federal, state and foreign franchise laws, anti-bribery laws and work safety and labor laws, among others.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	These matters can be time-consuming, divert management s attention and resources and result in significant legal and other expenses.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Furthermore, because litigation and administrative or government proceedings are inherently unpredictable, any of these proceedings could result in unfavorable outcomes, which could include monetary damages or fines and other sanctions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Any such result could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	We are dependent on our key management and other personnel.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our key executives, including of Henry Stupp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We have a relatively small number of employees, and the leadership and experience of Mr. Stupp and our other executives and key employees are important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategies.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our executives or other employees.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The loss of the services of Mr. Stupp or our other executives or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may encounter risks and difficulties in connection with acquisitions or other strategic transactions, and we may not realize the expected benefits of these transactions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire or represent new brands, and we have completed several such acquisitions during the past several years.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other brands or to engage in other strategic transactions that could enhance our portfolio or enable us to expand to new markets.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Our experience integrating acquired assets and businesses is limited, and we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits of any acquisition we may pursue.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage an expanding portfolio of brands, which could involve significantly increased costs and pose substantial challenges for management.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	assets or businesses turn out to be wrong; (vi) diversion of management s attention from our existing brand portfolio; (vii) adverse effects on existing business relationships; (viii) risks associated with foreign acquisitions or otherwise entering new geographic or customer markets, including regional differences in consumer preferences, branding standards and the general conduct of business, less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign jurisdictions and the other risks related to doing business outside the United States discussed elsewhere in these risk factors; and (ix) risks associated with new types of business arrangements in which we have no or limited prior experience.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Accordingly, our recent acquisitions and any future strategic transactions we pursue may not result in the anticipated benefits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In addition, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available when needed, on favorable terms or at all.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	If we seek to finance future acquisitions or other strategic transactions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities or by incurring other types of indebtedness, we may experience the risks associated with these transactions that are described elsewhere in these risk factors.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our strategic and marketing initiatives may not be successful.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We have invested significant funds and management time in furtherance of our global strategic and marketing initiatives, which are designed to strengthen our brands, assist our licensees in generating increased sales of products bearing our brands and build value for our stockholders over the long term.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We expect to continue and, in some cases, expand these initiatives in future periods.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	While we are hopeful that our efforts in executing these initiatives will grow our business and build stockholder value, we may not be successful in doing so and these initiatives may not result in the intended or expected benefits.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Any failure by us to execute our strategic initiatives, or the failure of these initiatives to cause our revenues to grow, could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results and financial performance.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We rely on our information technology systems, and our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches or other system failures.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We, as well as our licensees and franchisees, rely on various information technology systems to manage our respective operations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Our reliance on these systems exposes us to inherent costs and risks, including the time and capital resources required to maintain, upgrade, replace or otherwise change these systems or integrate new systems as and when needed, as well as the risks associated with any failure of these systems, which could result from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication or electrical failures.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Despite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and those of our licensees and franchisees are vulnerable to failures or other damage from these or other causes.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Although we have not experienced any material cybersecurity or system failure, accident or breach, some of our current and former licensees have experienced such events in the past.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S4	If such an event were to occur to our systems, it could result in a material disruption of our operations and internal controls and processes; substantial costs to rectify or correct the failure, if correction is possible; significant demands on management time; loss of or damage to our data or applications; inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information; or the incurrence of other material liabilities.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S5	If such an event were to occur to our licensees or franchisees systems, our royalty revenues could be reduced or disrupted due to decreased product sales, including sales of our branded products, as a result of reputational damage; diversion of costs and other resources from product sales; or inability of our licensees or franchisees to calculate royalties or generate royalty reports.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P71_S6	If any of these risks were to materialize, our business, prospects, performance and financial condition could be materially harmed.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Changes in our effective tax rates or tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our financial results.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We are subject to income tax in the United States, California and certain other state jurisdictions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In addition, following our acquisition of the Hi-Tec family of footwear brands, we are also subject to taxation in several foreign jurisdictions, which may have unusual, unfamiliar or particularly burdensome tax laws.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our new global tax structure could be negatively impacted by various factors, including changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions in which we earn income or changes in tax laws or interpretations of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, any of which could impact our future effective income tax rates.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as has been the case in Fiscal 2018 as a result of significant changes to U.S. federal tax laws.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Any increase in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, as there are many transactions and calculations in the ordinary course of our business that involve uncertain tax determinations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	If we are audited by tax authorities, these authorities could disagree with our judgments about our tax provisions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax authorities in the event of such an audit could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Any adverse result in such an audit or related litigation could materially negatively affect our income tax provision and results of operations in the period or periods for which the determination is made.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Moreover, any such audits or litigation, regardless of its outcome, could distract management and be expensive to defend, which could negatively affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business and reputation and could, if repeated, result in material misstatements in our financial results.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	However, our management previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of the last day of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P77_S3	As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 28, 2017, the last day of Fiscal 2017, and that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date or as of the last day of each of our first three fiscal quarters during Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Although our management has determined that these material weaknesses have been remediated and that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the last day of Fiscal 2018, as described in Item 9A of this Annual Report, these previously identified material weaknesses and conclusions of ineffective controls could continue to cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our reported financial and other information, adversely affect our reputation with lenders, retailers, investors, securities analysts and others, and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Moreover, these or other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could develop or be discovered in the future, and management could determine that our controls and procedures have again become inadequate.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In that event, we may be required to develop and implement remediation measures to address any weaknesses or deficiencies that are identified, as we did throughout Fiscal 2018 with respect to our previously identified material weaknesses, and any such measures could involve significant time and costs, distract management from our core business operations and ultimately be insufficient to address any weaknesses that are identified.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P78_S3	If any of these risks were to occur, there would be a greater likelihood that our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, in which case we could be required to restate our financial results.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Any such restatement could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees, litigation, significant reputational harm and material declines in our stock price.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Compliance with securities laws, regulations and financial reporting standards could increase our costs and pose challenges for our management team, and any compliance failures could materially harm our business.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Existing laws, regulations, listing requirements and other standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure significantly increase the costs and risks associated with operating as a publicly traded company in the United States.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Our management team devotes significant time and financial resources to try to comply with existing and evolving standards for public companies.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	Notwithstanding our efforts, we failed to comply with the SEC s reporting deadlines applicable to our annual report for Fiscal 2017 and our quarterly report for the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, and we have been forced to incur increased costs and divert time and other resources to hire personnel, engage consultants and change certain of our internal practices and policies in order to regain compliance with our public reporting requirements.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	we are obligated to file in the future also may not be considered timely, accurate or complete, in which case we may be forced to devote additional time and capital resources to further improve our public reporting systems and processes.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	In addition, any future noncompliance with public reporting requirements could subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, which could involve fines or other penalties, and could also adversely affect our financial results, result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial information and other public disclosures and jeopardize the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, as described elsewhere in these risk factors.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	If any of these risks were to occur, our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could materially decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Further, the SEC has passed, promulgated or proposed new rules on a variety of subjects, including, for example, preparing and filing financial statements, establishing and disclosing clawback and hedging policies and disclosing additional executive compensation information.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The existence of new and proposed laws and regulations relating to financial reporting or other disclosure obligations or that impose additional or more stringent compliance requirements could create uncertainties for public companies, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees, and generate significantly increased costs if we are required to add additional accounting or other staff, engage consultants or change our internal practices in order to comply with the new requirements.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	The occurrence of any of these outcomes could significantly harm our business, financial condition and performance.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and shares of our common stock are relatively illiquid.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to material fluctuations.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	These fluctuations can be caused by various factors, including, among others: (i) our financial results and financial condition, including our liquidity; (ii) our ability to maintain compliance with our obligations, including our credit facility with Cerberus; (iii) the successful completion of any acquisition or strategic transaction, including the integration of the acquired assets or businesses and realization of the intended or expected synergies and other benefits; (iv) any announcements by us, our retail partners or our competitors regarding or affecting the retail environment, the reputation of our brands, our existing or any new license agreements and brand representations, or acquisitions, strategic alliances or other transactions; (v) recruitment or departure of key personnel; (vi) changes in our financial guidance, if any, expectations for our financial results in the investment community, or the recommendations of any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; (vii) any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or any failures to comply with our public reporting requirements; (viii) market conditions in the retail industry and the economy as a whole; and (ix) the other risks described in these risk factors.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Further, as a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid, and the trading price for our common stock may be more affected by relatively small volumes of trading, than is the case for the common stock of companies with broader public ownership.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	If we are not able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq s requirements for continued listing, our common stock may be delisted from trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We received two deficiency letters from The Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq ) in Fiscal 2018, each of which indicated that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market because we failed to file certain of our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Although we have since filed these reports and regained compliance with this Nasdaq rule, we could fail to comply with this or other Nasdaq rules or requirements again in the future due to failures to file our periodic reports in a timely manner or other matters.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In such a case, we would receive further deficiency letters from Nasdaq and our common stock could be delisted from trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P87_S3	Any additional deficiency letters or any delisting event could severely limit the liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We may fail to meet publicly announced financial guidance or other expectations about our business, which would cause our common stock to decline in value.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	From time to time, we may provide forward-looking financial guidance regarding our performance.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Any such guidance would be based on our then-current views, expectations and assumptions and could be materially different than our actual results.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Additionally, securities analysts or others in the investment community may publish expectations for our financial results, which also could be materially different than our actual results.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P89_S3	These differences could occur for a variety of reasons, such as, for instance, changes to the assumptions used to forecast or calculate the financial guidance or expectations, or the occurrence of risks related to our performance and our business, including those discussed in these risk factors, among others.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P89_S4	Any failure to meet any financial guidance or expectations regarding our future performance could harm our reputation and cause our stock price to decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We may not pay dividends regularly or at all in the future.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Determinations regarding the payment of dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	As a result, we may not pay any dividends in future periods, whether or not we generate sufficient cash to do so.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	In addition, pursuant to our credit facility with Cerberus, subject to limited exceptions, we are prohibited from paying dividends or making other distributions to our stockholders without Cerberus s consent.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	As a result, any return on an investment in our common stock may be limited to an appreciation in the value of our common stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Offers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	The sale by our stockholders of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, such as under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, upon expiration of any lock-up periods applicable to outstanding shares, or upon our issuance of new shares as a result of the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or the vesting of restricted stock units, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	The availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock without any action by our stockholders.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Subject to the restrictions under our new credit facility with Cerberus, such shares of preferred stock may be issued on terms determined by our board of directors in its discretion, and may have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our common stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P95_S2	For instance, such shares of preferred stock could have liquidation preferences that are senior to the liquidation rights applicable to our common stock, could have superior voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or could have other terms that negatively impact the voting control or other rights of our common stockholders.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Additionally, the ownership interest of holders of our common stock would be diluted following the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Further, the preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, even at a time or under circumstances when you or other stockholders may prefer such a change in control.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	A small number of our stockholders beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock and therefore are able to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions, including the election of directors and a change of control.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The interests of these stockholders may differ from yours.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	A small number of stockholders beneficially own a significant portion of our common stock.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	As a result, these parties may be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P97_S2	These parties may have interests that differ from ours or yours, and they may vote in ways with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock as part of a sale of our Company.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Conversely, this concentration of ownership may facilitate a change of control at a time or under circumstances when you and other stockholders may prefer not to sell.
844161_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Further, this concentration of ownership could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.
844161_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease an 11,000 square foot office facility in Sherman Oaks, California, which serves as our corporate headquarters.
844161_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The lease for this facility will expire on October 31, 2021, subject to our option to renew the lease for an additional five years thereafter.
844161_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	We lease a 24,000 square foot office facility in Amsterdam, Netherlands since the completion of the Hi-Tec Acquisition, a portion of which is subleased to one of our licensees.
844161_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	The lease for this facility expires in December 2026.
844161_18_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also leased a 112,000 square foot warehouse facility in Modesto, California from the completion of the Hi-Tec Acquisition until the expiration of the lease in December 2017.
844161_18_ITEM2_P1_S3	This facility was subleased to and used by one of our licensees.
844161_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
844161_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that could harm our business.
844161_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	We are not currently aware of any such legal proceedings or claims to which we are a party or to which our property is subject that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

844161_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Due to the nature of our business, we do not believe a published industry or line-of-business index or a comparable peer group of publicly traded licensing companies exists.
844161_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	As a result, we have compared the return on investment in our common stock to the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S P 100 Stock Index.
844161_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	The table and graph below compare the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S P 100 Stock Index for the period commencing on February 2, 2013 and ending on February 3, 2018.

844161_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following financial information has been derived from our consolidated financial statements.
844161_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	Our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 and for each of the three years ended February 3, 2018 are included in this Annual Report and have been audited by our independent registered public accounting firms.
844161_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	You should read this information together with Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .
844161_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income and other income, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) intangible asset impairment loss, (vi) restructuring charges, (vii) business acquisition and integration costs and (viii) stock-based compensation and stock warrant charges.
844161_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

844161_18_ITEM6_P2_S1	We believe it is useful to investors for the same reasons.
844161_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a profitability measure in that it does not include the interest expense on our long-term debt, our provision for income taxes, the effect of our expenditures for capital assets and certain intangible assets, or the costs of acquiring businesses and restructuring our operations, or our non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and stock warrants.
844161_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	A reconciliation from net (loss) from continuing operations as reported in our consolidated statement of operations to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:
844161_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	Computed based on selling, general and administrative expenses divided by revenues.
844161_18_ITEM6_P5_S0	Computed based on net (loss) income from continuing operations divided by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity.

844161_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Fiscal 2018 refers to our fiscal year ended February 3, 2018; Fiscal 2017 refers to our fiscal year ended January 28, 2017; and Fiscal 2016 refers to our fiscal year ended January 30, 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	We have a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January 31.
844161_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	This results in a 53 week fiscal year approximately every four or five years.
844161_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year, while each of Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 were 52 week fiscal years.
844161_18_ITEM7_P0_S5	This discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on Form 10 K.
844161_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
844161_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical facts that relate to future events or circumstances or our future performance.
844161_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	The words anticipates , believes , estimates , plans , expects , objectives , goals , aims , hopes , may , might , will , likely , should and similar words or expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

844161_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	Forward-looking statements are based on our current views, expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, achievements or stock prices to be materially different from any future results, performance, achievements or stock prices expressed or implied by the forward looking statements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others, those described in Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report.
844161_18_ITEM7_P2_S5	In addition, we operate in a competitive and rapidly evolving industry in which new risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of the risks we may face, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors could cause actual results to differ from our expectations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P2_S6	As a result of these and other potential risks and uncertainties, forward-looking statements should not be relied on or viewed as predictions of future events because some or all of them may turn out to be wrong.

844161_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Cherokee Global Brands is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands it owns, including Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops, Everyday California, Carole Little, Sideout and others, which are licensed in multiple consumer product categories and sectors.
844161_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	As part of our business strategy, we also regularly evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.
844161_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	We believe the strength of our brand portfolio and platform of design, product sourcing and marketing capabilities has made us one of the leading global licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, home products and accessories.
844161_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We have licensing relationships with recognizable retail partners in their global locations to provide them with the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands.
844161_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	We refer to this strategy as our Direct to Retail or DTR licensing model.
844161_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	We also have license agreements with manufacturers and distributors for the manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands, which we refer to as wholesale licensing.
844161_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	In addition, we have relationships with franchisees that operate Flip Flop Shops retail stores located worldwide.
844161_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	As a brand marketer and manager, we do not directly sell product ourselves.
844161_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Rather, we earn royalties when our licensees and franchisees sell licensed products bearing the trademarks that we own.
844161_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	For certain of our key legacy brands, including Cherokee, Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk and Liz Lange, we are shifting our strategy for U.S. sales from DTR licensing to wholesale licensing.
844161_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition, we are primarily pursuing a wholesale licensing strategy for global sales of our recently acquired Hi-Tec, Magnum, Interceptor and 50 Peaks brands.
844161_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	We believe these arrangements signal a significant shift in our business strategy, from our historical focus on DTR licensing for all of our brands to a substantially greater focus on wholesale licensing for many of our key brands.
844161_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	Although we believe these new wholesale licensing arrangements may help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships, and may provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, this shift in our strategy also exposes us to a number of risks, and it has had a negative effect on our results of operations in Fiscal 2018 as we transition to our new licensees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	This effect could continue or worsen, particularly in the near-term.
844161_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We derive revenues primarily from licensing our trademarks to retailers and wholesalers all over the world, and we are continually pursuing relationships with new retailers, wholesalers and others in order to expand the reach of our existing brands into new geographic and customer markets and new types of stores and other selling mediums.
844161_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	As of February 3, 2018, we had 54 continuing license agreements in approximately 80 countries, 42 of which pertained to brands in our Cherokee Global Brands reportable segment and 12 of which pertained to our recently acquired Hi-Tec portfolio of brands, which are included in our Hi-Tec reportable segment.
844161_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	These arrangements include relationships with Walmart, Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Nishimatsuya, Big 5, Academy, JD Sports, Black s and Lidl.
844161_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	As of February 3, 2018, we had contractual rights to receive over $64.5 million forward facing minimum royalty revenues over the next ten years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with contract renewals.
844161_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The terms of our royalty arrangements vary for each of our licensees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	We receive quarterly royalty statements and periodic sales and purchasing information from our licensees and franchisees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	However, our licensees and franchisees are generally not required to provide, and typically do not provide, information that would enable us to determine the specific reasons for period to period fluctuations in sales or purchases.
844161_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	As a result, we do not typically have sufficient information to determine the effects on our operations of changes in price, volume or mix of products sold.
844161_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern in its report contained in this Annual Report.
844161_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for more information.
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, we acquired Hi-Tec Sports International Holdings BV and subsidiaries ( Hi-Tec ) and simultaneously sold certain sales and distribution operations of Hi-Tec to third parties along with the related assets and liabilities (the Hi-Tec Acquisition ).
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	These third parties became our licensees at that time and include Carolina Footwear Group, LLC ( Carolina ), Batra Limited ( Batra ) and Sunningdale ( South Africa ).
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we sold the remaining Hi-Tec sales and distribution operations to International Brands Group ( IBG ).
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	The business sold to IBG is reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	We do not have any ownership interests in Carolina, Batra, South Africa or IBG.
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	After these transactions and consistent with our planned conversion of Hi-Tec, we continue to own the intellectual property of Hi-Tec.
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S6	We can now access markets addressed by Hi-Tec with its Hi-Tec, Magnum, Interceptor and 50 Peaks brands, and we have multiple cross-selling opportunities with our other brands.
844161_18_ITEM7_P10_S7	In addition, we have various opportunities to expand Hi-Tec into other product categories, such as apparel and accessories.
844161_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Hi-Tec was a Dutch footwear business that designed, marketed and sold footwear globally through major retailers, independent distributors, licensees, government contracts and directly to consumers via ecommerce.
844161_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Prior to our acquisition, Hi-Tec operated under a distribution model whereby they designed, contracted for the manufacture of, sold and distributed their products.
844161_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our acquisition of the Hi-Tec and conversion of these brands to a new business model is subject to significant risks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
844161_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	We funded the purchase price of the Hi-Tec Acquisition through (i) cash on hand, (ii) proceeds from simultaneously selling certain Hi-Tec operating assets to Carolina, Batra and South Africa, (iii) the prepayment of certain guaranteed minimum royalties under license agreements with Carolina, Batra and South Africa, (iv) the net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock, (v) proceeds from a new credit facility and (vi) proceeds from a receivables funding loan extended by one of our directors.
844161_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Our license agreement with Target covering sales of most Cherokee branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2017, and our license agreement with Target covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category expired on January 31, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our license agreement with Kohl s covering sales of Tony Hawk branded products in the United States expired on January 31, 2018, and our license agreement with Target covering sales of Liz Lange branded products in the United States also expired on January 31, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Replacing terminated licensees is a normal part of our business, and we have entered into new wholesale licensing agreements that are intended to replace over time the royalty revenue related to our former relationships with Target and Kohl s.
844161_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	However, replacing these revenues is a significant challenge due to the size of these businesses, and the expiration of these license agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business.
844161_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
844161_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We typically enter into license agreements with retailers, manufacturers and distributors for a certain brand in specific product categories over explicit territories, which can include one country or groups of countries and territories.
844161_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Over the last three years, our revenue mix has changed from 71% in the U.S. and Canada in Fiscal 2016 down to 47% in the U.S. and Canada in Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	This change is a result of the expiration and transition of our license agreements with Target in the United States and our Hi-Tec Acquisition in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, which generates a higher portion of its revenues in Europe in comparison to our other brands.
844161_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Our revenues b y geographic territory are as follows:
844161_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Our largest licensees in the United States have historically been Target and Kohl s, which together contributed 22%, 53% and 66% of our revenues for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	One of our license agreements with Target expired at the end of Fiscal 2017, and the rest of our license agreements with Target and our license agreement with Kohl s expired at the end of Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Target had the exclusive rights to sell Cherokee branded products for all product categories in the United States through Fiscal 2017, and in the school uniforms category through Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Royalty revenues from our Cherokee brand at Target in the United States were $0.9 million, $11.3 million and $15.8 million in Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, which accounted for 3%, 33% and 46% of our revenues for these respective periods.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The decrease in royalties over this period was due to a decline in retail sales of Cherokee branded products and the expirations of the Target license agreements as Target began to transition away from selling these products as the end of the license agreements approached.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	Under a separate license agreement that terminated on January 31, 2018, Target paid us a fixed percentage of sales of products bearing our Liz Lange brand in the United States.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	Royalty revenues from our Liz Lange brand at Target in the United States were $1.0 million, $2.1 million and $2.4 million in Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, which accounted for 3%, 6% and 7% of our revenues for these respective periods.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	We are replacing our Target license with various other licensees for the sale of Cherokee branded products in the United States, and we have entered into a master license agreement with a third party for Liz Lange branded maternity products beginning in Fiscal 2019.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S5	Our ability to generate royalty revenues from other licensees sufficient to replace our historical royalty revenues from Target is yet to be determined, particularly in the near term as our wholesale arrangements intended to replace our license agreement with Target for the Cherokee and Liz Lange brands begin to gain traction with new retailers and their customers.
844161_18_ITEM7_P18_S6	Our royalty revenues from Target are expected to decline further in Fiscal 2019, but to a lesser extent than the decline in Fiscal 2018 due to the expiration of these licenses with Target.
844161_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Kohl s had exclusive rights to sell Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products for all product categories in the United States through Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Kohl s is obligated to pay royalties to us based on a percentage of their sales of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products.
844161_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	However, because retail sales did not exceed the contractual minimum guarantees in any of the periods presented, we earned the minimum royalties of $4.6 million, $4.8 million and $4.8 million for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, which accounted for 15%, 14% and 14% of our revenues for these respective periods.
844161_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	While we have entered into agreements with new licensees for the sale of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products, our ability to generate royalty revenues from other licensees sufficient to replace Kohl s historical royalty payments to us is yet to be determined, and we may experience decreased revenue levels result from the expiration of this relationship, particularly in the near term as our wholesale arrangements intended to replace our license agreement with Kohl s begin to gain traction with new retailers and their customers.
844161_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	Our royalty revenues from Kohl s are expected to decline significantly in Fiscal 2019 due to the expiration of this license with Kohl s at the end of Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our royalty revenues from Asia and Latin America primarily resulted from licensees in Japan, China, Mexico, Peru, Chile and India.
844161_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	Royalty revenues from these territories totaled $6.7 million in Fiscal 2018, compared to $7.3 million in Fiscal 2017 and $6.4 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	Revenues from our Japanese licensees grew in Fiscal 2017, but was partially offset by a decline in revenues during Fiscal 2018 from our Chinese licensee.
844161_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	United Kingdom, Europe and Others .
844161_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Revenues from our licensees in Europe and other territories were generally consistent from Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2017, but grew significantly in Fiscal 2018 as the impact of Hi-Tec and its portfolio of brands is included since its acquisition in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The table below contains certain information about our continuing operations from our consolidated statements of operations along with other data and percentages.
844161_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.
844161_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	These results include the operations of Hi-Tec since its acquisition on December 7, 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income and other income, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) intangible asset impairment loss, (vi) restructuring charges, (vii) business acquisition and integration costs and (viii) stock-based compensation and stock warrant charges.
844161_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
844161_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	We use Adjusted EBITDA, along with other GAAP measures, as a measure of profitability, because Adjusted EBITDA helps us compare our performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impact of our capital structure, the effect of operating in different tax jurisdictions, the impact of our asset base, which can differ depending on the book value of assets and the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization, and the cost of acquiring businesses and restructuring our operations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	We believe it is useful to investors for the same reasons.
844161_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a profitability measure in that it does not include the interest expense on our long-term debt, our provision for income taxes, the effect of our expenditures for capital assets and certain intangible assets, or the costs of acquiring businesses and restructuring our operations, or our non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and stock warrants.
844161_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	See a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to our consolidated statement of operations in Item 6. of this Annual Report.
844161_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	The decrease in royalty revenues in Fiscal 2018 was primarily due the decrease in Cherokee royalties as we transition from Target to our new wholesale licensing partners for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States.
844161_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	This decrease was substantially offset by having the operations of Hi-Tec in our results for the full year of Fiscal 2018 versus only a portion of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 since we acquired Hi-Tec in December 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our royalty revenues from sales of Liz Lange product at Target also declined in Fiscal 2018 as Target began to transition away from Liz Lange branded product in the latter half of fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cherokee branded products are now distributed in the United States under wholesale licensing arrangements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	In the past, sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States were governed by our DTR license agreement with Target.
844161_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	These new wholesale arrangements consist of multiple license agreements with different distributors that include higher royalty rates but lower minimum annual royalty obligations, as compared to our license agreement with Target.
844161_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Our overall royalty revenues from our licensees sales of Cherokee branded products decreased 52% to $11.1 million in Fiscal 2018 from $23.0 million in Fiscal 2017 primarily due to the termination of our license agreements with Target and the ongoing transition to other Cherokee brand licensees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	Even though our license agreements with Target have expired, our Fiscal 2018 year-end forecast of estimated future cash flows from our other licensees of Cherokee branded products indicates that the fair value of the underlying trademark exceeds its carrying values and accordingly, is not impaired.
844161_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	In December 2016, we completed the Hi-Tec Acquisition whereby we acquired the intellectual property of Hi-Tec, including the Hi-Tec, Magnum, Interceptor and 50-Peaks brands and related trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	At that time, we also entered into wholesale license agreements with certain of Hi-Tec s operating partners and/or distributors to sell Hi-Tec, Magnum, Interceptor and 50 Peaks branded products in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, Asia Pacific, South Africa and other territories.
844161_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	These arrangements are structured similarly to our other wholesale licensing arrangements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Our royalty revenues from our licensees sales of Hi-Tec, Magnum, Interceptor and 50-Peaks branded products totaled $9.7 million for Fiscal 2018 compared to $1.2 million for Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Fiscal 2018 represents a full year of royalty revenues, while Fiscal 2017 represents a partial period since we acquired Hi-Tec during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our royalty revenues from our license agreements for the sale of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products increased 8% to $5.5 million in Fiscal 2018 from $5.1 million in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	These revenues primarily represent contractual minimum guarantees with Kohl s through the termination of the Kohl s licensee agreement on January 31, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	At the end of Fiscal 2018, we have new license agreements for the sale of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products in the United States, but we do not currently expect our Fiscal 2019 royalty revenues from these new licensees to meet the previous level of the Kohl s minimum guarantees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S3	While replacing expiring license agreements with new license agreements is a normal part of our business and may result in a temporary decline in revenues, our royalty revenues from our licensee s sales of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products in future periods will depend on the ability of these new licensees to gain traction with new retailers and their customers.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S4	The transition from our license agreement with Kohl's to new licensees has taken longer than previously estimated, and accordingly, our revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2018 were significantly lower than our revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S5	Although our revenues from these new license agreements increased in Fiscal 2018 in comparison to Fiscal 2017, our Fiscal 2018 year-end forecast of estimated future cash flows from these agreements indicates that the fair value of the underlying trademarks is less than their carrying values.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S6	Accordingly, we recorded a $12.2 million intangible asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 related to the Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S7	In conjunction with this impairment assessment, we concluded that the competitive and economic environment for the use of our Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk trademarks no longer supported an indefinite life.
844161_18_ITEM7_P29_S8	Accordingly, these trademarks will be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Our royalty revenues from our licensees sales of Liz Lange branded products decreased 55% to $1.1 million in Fiscal 2018 from $2.4 million in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	A large majority of this revenue was generated from our license agreement with Target that terminated on January 31, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	At the end of Fiscal 2018, we have a new master license agreement with a third party for Liz Lange branded maternity products beginning in Fiscal 2019, but we do not currently expect our Fiscal 2019 royalty revenues from this new licensee to meet the previous level of the Target minimum guarantees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	and may result in a temporary decline in revenues, our royalty revenues from our licensee s sales of Liz Lange branded products in future periods will depend on the ability of new licensees to gain traction with new retailers and their customers.
844161_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The transition from our license agreement with Target to new licensees has taken longer than previously estimated, and accordingly, our revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2018 were significantly lower than our revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Our Fiscal 2018 year-end forecast of estimated future cash flows from this new master license agreement and our other Liz Lange license agreements indicates that the fair value of the underlying trademarks is less than its carrying value.
844161_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	Accordingly, we recorded a $14.0 million intangible asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 related to the Liz Lange trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P31_S4	In conjunction with this impairment assessment, we concluded that the competitive and economic environment for the use of our Liz Lange trademarks no longer supported an indefinite life.
844161_18_ITEM7_P31_S5	Accordingly, these trademarks will be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our franchise agreements typically have a 10-year initial term and require our franchisees to pay us an initial franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on retail sales.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Franchisees of Flip Flop Shops retail stores outside the United States typically cover multiple store locations within a specified territory and may also include an initial master franchisee fee.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	As of February 3, 2018, we have franchise agreements with Flip Flop Shops franchisees that encompass 43 retail stores in the United States and 13 retail stores in international markets.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our royalty revenues decreased 14% to $2.1 million in Fiscal 2018 from $2.4 million in Fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of our franchisees closing approximately 20 under-performing retail stores during the year.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	This decrease in royalty revenues was reflected in our revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2018, which were significantly lower than our revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	Our Fiscal 2018 year-end forecast of estimated future cash flows from our franchise agreements and the projected growth from new store openings indicates that the fair value of the underlying trademark is less than its carrying value.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S5	Accordingly, we recorded a $8.4 million intangible asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 related to the Flip Flop Shops trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S6	Our Fiscal 2018 year-end forecast also estimated that an $0.9 million impairment loss was necessary related to our Every Day California trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S7	In conjunction with these impairment assessments, we concluded that the competitive and economic environment for the use of our Flip Flop Shops and Every Day California trademarks no longer supported indefinite lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P33_S8	Accordingly, these trademarks will be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses, increased 33% to $25.4 million in Fiscal 2018 from $19.1 million in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Including Hi-Tec in our results for the full year of fiscal 2018 versus only a partial quarter in Fiscal 2017 since the Hi-Tec Acquisition increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $7.2 million.
844161_18_ITEM7_P34_S2	These ongoing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, marketing, sales, legal, rent, information systems and other administrative costs that are part of our ongoing operations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	We acquired Hi-Tec in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017 and continued to integrate Hi-Tec into our operations during Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	The legal, due diligence and other costs related to business acquisition and integration were $7.5 million in Fiscal 2018 and $11.5 million in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	While estimates of future costs are inherently subject to uncertainty, we expect these costs to be significantly less in Fiscal 2019.
844161_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	We also incurred restructuring charges of $1.1 million in Fiscal 2018 and $3.8 million in Fiscal 2017 to consolidate Hi-Tec into our ongoing operations, and we incurred a restructuring charge of $1.0 million in Fiscal 2018 in our Cherokee Global Brands segment as we aligned our management and staff to appropriately support our current operations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P35_S4	Restructuring charges consist of employee severance, contract termination and other restructuring-related costs.
844161_18_ITEM7_P35_S5	Contract termination costs consist primarily of costs that will continue to be incurred under operating leases and other agreements for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company, offset by any sublease income to be received.
844161_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Stock-based compensation and stock warrant charges in Fiscal 2018 include stock warrant charges of $1.3 million in connection with the issuance of stock warrants relating to the amendments to the Cerberus credit facility with no comparable expense in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We own various trademarks that are considered to have indefinite lives, while others are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	being amortized over their useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	Depreciation and amortization expenses remained relatively constant when comparing Fiscal 2018 to Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Our interest expense increased significantly when we entered in the Cerberus credit facility and completed the Hi-Tec acquisition during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	We anticipate that this higher level of interest expense will continue in Fiscal 2019 and beyond until our cash flows from operations can be used to reduce our debt levels.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	In Fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate was negative 5.7%, while our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 was negative 59.6%.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Even though we generated pretax losses in both Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, we did not recognize tax benefits in either of those years.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	Rather, we recorded income tax provisions of $3.0 million and $3.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	As a result of cumulative losses in our U.S. tax jurisdication primarily caused by trademark impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred taxes of our U.S. operations to zero.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	In addition, the benefits of the deferred tax assets of the foreign subsidiaries acquired in the Hi-Tec Acquisition are not being recognized due to the cumulative losses generated by those foreign subsidiaries.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S5	In Fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate was different from the federal statutory rate primarialy due to valuation allowances established in the U.S. during Fiscal 2018, changes in the enacted federal statutory tax rate as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( Tax Act ) that was enacted in December 2017, and non-deductible stock-based compensation.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S6	In Fiscal 2017, our effective tax rate was negative primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs incurred for the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P40_S7	For further information on the effective tax rate and Tax Act s impact, see Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our net loss from continuing operations increased to a loss of $55.9 million in Fiscal 2018 from a loss of $8.7 million in Fiscal 2017 as a result of the above factors, which equated to a loss of $4.16 per share on a diluted basis in Fiscal 2018 and a loss of $0.93 per share on a diluted basis in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased 74% to $3.9 million in Fiscal 2018 from $14.9 million in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The decrease in royalty revenues from Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in North American royalties as we transitioned from Target to our new wholesale licensing partners for sales of Cherokee branded products in the United States.
844161_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	This decrease was partially offset by an increase in royalties from our licensees in South America, India, the Middle East, South Africa and Asia as the demand for Cherokee-branded and other products grew in these regions.
844161_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	Flip Flop Shops royalty and franchise fee revenues also increased due to the inclusion of a full year of these revenues in Fiscal 2017 compared to a partial quarter of these revenues in Fiscal 2016 after Flip Flop Shops was acquired in October 2015.
844161_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	Royalties from Hi-Tec after its acquisition in December 2016 added $1.2 million of royalty revenues in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% to $19.1 million in Fiscal 2017 from $16.6 million in Fiscal 2016 as additional costs were added as a result of the Hi-Tec Acquisition during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	These ongoing selling, general and administrative costs increased to 56.2% of revenues in Fiscal 2017 from 47.8% of revenues in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	Business acquisition and integration costs, which includes legal, due diligence, integration and other costs were $11.5 million in Fiscal 2017 and $1.2 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	We incurred restructuring charges of $3.8 million in Fiscal 2017 related to the Hi-Tec Acquisition, which consists of employee severance, contract termination and other restructuring-related costs.
844161_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	operating leases and other agreements for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company, offset by any sublease income to be received.
844161_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our interest expense increased to $1.7 million in Fiscal 2017 from $0.7 million in Fiscal 2016 primarily due to the debt we incurred to acquire Hi-Tec in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our effective tax rate was negative 59.6% in Fiscal 2017 versus 34.1% in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	This significant fluctuation in our effective tax rate was primarily due to nondeductible transaction costs related to the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Since the transaction costs exceeded the Fiscal 2017 pretax book loss, the result was a negative effective tax rate.
844161_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $8.7 million in Fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of business acquisition and integration costs and restructuring charges that we incurred in connection with the Hi-Tec acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Our net income from continuing operations was $8.4 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	This equated to a loss from continuing operations of $0.93 per share on a diluted basis in Fiscal 2017 versus earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.95 per share on a diluted basis in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased 18% to $14.9 million in Fiscal 2017 from $18.1 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	We generally finance our working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and lines of credit.
844161_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Terms loans are used to supplement these lines of credit and finance the acquisition of businesses and trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	In December 2016, we entered into a $50.0 million credit facility with Cerberus that replaced our previous credit facility with JPMorgan and was used to partially fund the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	As of February 3, 2018, we had $49.5 million in outstanding indebtedness under this credit facility with Cerberus, all of which is due no later than December 2021.
844161_18_ITEM7_P49_S4	We may seek to refinance all or a portion of this indebtedness before its due date.
844161_18_ITEM7_P49_S5	Any such refinancing would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time, which could affect our ability to obtain attractive refinance terms when desired, or at all.
844161_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We used $11.7 million of cash in our operating activities related to our continuing operations in Fiscal 2018 compared to cash provided by operating activities related to our continuing operations of $10.4 million in Fiscal 2017 and $11.9 million in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The $22.1 million decrease in cash flow from continuing operations in Fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from the $10.8 million increase in our loss from operations after adding back noncash expenses.
844161_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	In addition, the fluctuation in our accounts payable used an additional $11.2 million of cash primarily as a result of paying service providers and vendors in Fiscal 2018 for costs incurred in Fiscal 2017 in connection with the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	We generated $0.7 million of cash from our investing activities in Fiscal 2018 compared to $73.8 million used in Fiscal 2017 and $13.4 million used in Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	We sold the remaining sales and distribution operations of Hi-Tec to International Brands Group in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, which generated $1.3 million of cash.
844161_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	An additional $1.8 million of cash was received in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 related to this sale.
844161_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	We did not acquire any businesses in Fiscal 2018, but we used $73.3 million of cash in Fiscal 2017 to acquire Hi-Tec, and we used $12.9 million of cash in Fiscal 2016 to acquire intangible assets relating to Everyday California and Flip Flop Shops.
844161_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	We also use cash to continually invest in the maintenance of our trademarks around the world, and we make recurring capital investments in property and equipment.
844161_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	We used $1.1 million of cash in our financing activities in Fiscal 2018 as we made payments on our outstanding accounts receivable financing obligations directly related to the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The Cerberus credit facility was amended twice during Fiscal 2018 after we failed to maintain the financial and reporting covenants as required.
844161_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	In connection with the first amendment in August 2017, we issued 947,870 shares of our common stock at $4.22 per share in a private place to several investors, including certain of the Company s directors, officers and large stockholders, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $3.9 million.
844161_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	In connection with this private placement, the Company issued warrants to these investors to purchase 326,695 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $4.22 per share.
844161_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	As part of the second amendment of the Cerberus credit facility in December 2017, we also issued warrants to purchase 511,111 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.25 per share to certain investors, including one of our significant shareholders and two members of our board of directors, as an inducement for their participation in the Cerberus credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	We will not receive cash from these warrants until, and if, they are exercised.
844161_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our financing activities provided cash of $63.5 million in Fiscal 2017, which were primarily used to fund the Hi-Tec Acquisition in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Hi-Tec Acquisition was financed with various sources of cash.
844161_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	One component was a public offering of 4,237,750 shares of our common stock at $9.50 per share, which resulted in net proceeds to us of $36.9 million.
844161_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	Further, we borrowed $45.0 million under the Cerberus credit facility, a portion of which was used to repay our previous credit facility with JPMorgan and a portion of which was used for the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	In addition, we borrowed $5.0 million on an unsecured basis from Jess Ravich, the Chairman of the Company s Board of Directors, and $8.7 million from one of our licensees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	During Fiscal 2016, our financing activities provided $0.5 million of cash.
844161_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	We borrowed $6.0 million under our JP Morgan credit agreement to finance our acquisition of Flip Flop Shops, and we used $7.6 million to repay a portion of the JPMorgan indebtedness.
844161_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	In December 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit facility with Cerberus, which was amended in August 2017 and November 2017 and provided a $45.0 million term loan and a revolving credit facility up to $5.0 million.
844161_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	We used a portion of the term loan proceeds to fund the Hi-Tec Acquisition, including the repayment of substantially all the outstanding indebtedness of Hi-Tec, and to repay all amounts owed under its previous credit facility with JPMorgan.
844161_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	We used the proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility for working capital purposes in Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Cerberus credit facility expires in December 2021 and bears interest based either on LIBOR or an alternate base rate plus a margin.
844161_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	The weighted-average interest rate at February 3, 2018 was 11.0%.
844161_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	The Cerberus credit facility contains customary restrictive covenants for facilities and transactions of this type, including, among other things, the maintenance of certain financial covenants, limitations on the payment of dividends, the requirement to meet certain revenue standards after the expiration or termination of any material contracts, and the requirement to obtain Cerberus s consent before the Company can take certain specified actions.
844161_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Events of default include, among other things, the occurrence of a change of control of the Company.
844161_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	The Cerberus credit facility also imposes various restrictions and obligations on us regarding the operation of our business, including covenants that require us to obtain Cerberus s consent before we can take certain specified actions.
844161_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	As collateral for the Cerberus credit facility, we granted a first priority security interest in favor of Cerberus in substantially all of our assets (including trademarks), and our indebtedness is guaranteed by our subsidiaries.
844161_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	At February 3, 2018 we had $49.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Cerberus credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The primary financial covenants in our Cerberus credit facility are (i) quarterly cumulative minimum levels of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement), (ii) a quarterly leverage ratio that begins at the end of Fiscal 2019, (iii) a quarterly fixed charge coverage ratio that also begins at the end of Fiscal 2019 and (iv) a continual $2 million liquidity covenant based on our cash balances and availability under the revolving credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	Based on our current forecasts, we anticipate that we will achieve the quarterly cumulative minimum levels of EBITDA and Fiscal 2019 leverage and fixed charge coverages ratios, but that we will violate the liquidity covenant within the next twelve months without an infusion of cash or an increase in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	firm describing the uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern, which itself results in noncompliance with covenants in the Cerberus credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and the compliance failure, and potential failure, subject us to significant risks, including Cerberus s right to terminate its obligations under the Cerberus credit facility, declare all or any portion of the borrowed amounts then outstanding to be accelerated and due and payable, and/or exercise any other rights or remedies it may have under applicable law, including foreclosing on our assets that serve as collateral for the borrowed amounts.
844161_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	If any of these rights were to be exercised, our financial condition and ability to continue operations would be materially jeopardized.
844161_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	We plan to address these issues by seeking an increase in our borrowing capacity under the Cerberus credit facility and amending existing covenants, or by seeking additional liquidity from other lenders with Cerberus consent.
844161_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	We will further evaluate our ability to meet our obligations as they come due over the next twelve months, and we believe the successful amendment of the Cerberus credit facility is a critical part of our plans to meet our obligations as they come due.
844161_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to execute these plans.
844161_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Pursuant to the approval of our Board of Directors, in June 2016 we repurchased and retired 60,082 shares of our common stock in open market transactions at a weighted average purchase price of $12.24 and for an aggregate purchase price of $0.7 million.
844161_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	Further repurchases of our common stock or the declaration and payment of any future dividends or repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations in our credit facility and would be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, and other factors that may be deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
844161_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	We lease certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through 2027.
844161_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	We also have long-term debt that we incurred related to business and trademark acquisitions, and we have certain long-term consulting and other agreements that expire at various dates through 2022.
844161_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	As of February 3, 2018, we were not the guarantor of any material third party obligations and we did not have any irrevocable repurchase obligations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P63_S3	Our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of February 3, 2018 for the years following our Fiscal 2018 are summarized in the following table:
844161_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Represents estimated future interest payments (based on current interest rates) related to our credit facility with Cerberus, which bears interest at floating rates.
844161_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	Actual interest payments will be based on future interest rates and may vary significantly from these estimates.
844161_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
844161_18_ITEM7_P65_S1	To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
844161_18_ITEM7_P65_S2	Judgment is also required about the disclosure of contingent liabilities and other matters.
844161_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty by their nature, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	We believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results.
844161_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	We recognize revenue under our various license and franchise agreements as services are rendered, or are otherwise earned in accordance with the underlying agreements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Royalties are typically earned based on the licensees retail or wholesale sales of licensed products, or based on the cost of producing the licensed goods.
844161_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	Revenues from license fees, up-front payments and milestone payments, which we receive in connection with other rights and services that represent continuing obligations of ours, are deferred and recognized in accordance with the license agreements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	Minimum guaranteed royalties paid in advance of the culmination of the earnings process, the majority of which are non refundable to the licensee, are deferred and recognized as revenues when earned.
844161_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Initial franchise fees are recognized as revenue when a franchised location opens, since the services and conditions related to the franchise fee have generally been performed at that point.
844161_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	Renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue when the renewal agreements are signed and the fee is paid since there are no material services and conditions related to these franchise fees.
844161_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Our license and franchise agreements typically include audit rights to allow us to validate the amount of royalties received.
844161_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently determined under audit are recognized when the differences become known and are considered collectible.
844161_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	We regularly enforce our intellectual property rights and pursue third parties that are utilizing our trademarks without a license.
844161_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	Royalties generated from these enforcement proceedings are recognized when they are determined and considered collectible.
844161_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	We consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenues to our operating results.
844161_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	We hold various trademarks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and similar government agencies in a number of other countries.
844161_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Acquired trademarks are either capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, or classified as an indefinite-lived asset and not amortized if no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit their useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	We routinely evaluate the remaining useful life of trademarks that are not being amortized to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life.
844161_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations and is not amortized.
844161_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the asset s carrying amount or the reporting unit s book value exceeds its fair value.
844161_18_ITEM7_P74_S2	We estimate these fair values based on discounted cash flow models that include assumptions determined by us regarding projected revenues, operating costs and discount rates.
844161_18_ITEM7_P74_S3	Our expectations regarding license agreement renewals are also considered, along with forecasts of revenues from replacement licensees for those that have terminated.
844161_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	In determining if there was an impairment of the goodwill associated with the Hi-Tec reporting unit during our annual impairment testing for Fiscal 2018 that occurs during our year-end close process, we used the discounted cash flow method (income approach) and the market multiples method (market approach) to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit.
844161_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	We assigned a 50% weighting to the income approach and a 50% weighting to the market approach.
844161_18_ITEM7_P75_S2	The results of our annual impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our Hi-Tec reporting unit was 22% higher than the book value of the reporting unit.
844161_18_ITEM7_P75_S3	The income approach is affected by, among other things, our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations and the estimated weighted average cost of capital.
844161_18_ITEM7_P75_S4	Changes in the business plan, operating results, or changes in the weighted average cost of capital may materially impact the estimated value of the Hi-Tec reorting unit under the income approach.
844161_18_ITEM7_P75_S5	Changes in marketplace multiples may materially impact the estimated value of the Hi-Tec reporting unit under the market approach.
844161_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	In connection with our Fiscal 2018 annual impairment testing of our indefinite lived trademarks, our discounted cash flow model indicated that indefinite lived trademarks related to four of our brands were impaired, and we recognized an impairment charge of $35.5 million related to our Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Flip Flop Shops and Every Day California trademarks.
844161_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	These impairment charges resulted primarily from significant changes to our cash flow projections to reflect lower revenue expectations in the future and to align the resulting estimates of fair value with the fair value indicated by our then current market capitalization.
844161_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	In conjunction with these impairment assessments we concluded that the competitive and economic environment for the use of these trademarks no longer supported indefinite useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	Accordingly, these trademarks will be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	and our latest discounted cash flow model indicates that they are not impaired and have an excess of fair values over carrying values.
844161_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	The discounted cash flow model used in determining the fair values of our indefinite-lived trademarks requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates.
844161_18_ITEM7_P78_S1	Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist, and therefore our trademarks could be further impaired.
844161_18_ITEM7_P78_S2	The valuation of our trademarks is affected by, among other things, our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P78_S3	Changes in the business plan, operating results, or application of alternative assumptions that are different than the estimates used to develop the valuations of the assets may materially impact their valuation.
844161_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_18_ITEM7_P80_S2	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income during the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_18_ITEM7_P80_S3	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Beginning with Fiscal 2018, we record the tax effect of equity issuances within the income statement rather than paid-in capital.
844161_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	We account for uncertainty in income taxes based on financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	A tax position is initially recognized in our financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_18_ITEM7_P82_S3	Such tax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon final settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_18_ITEM7_P82_S4	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, and when our uncertain tax positions are resolved or our judgment about these tax positions change, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, which could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.
844161_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We do not have off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	From time to time we invest our excess cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity, these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets and do not represent a material interest rate risk to us.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	In relation to our credit facility with Cerberus, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have increased our interest expense for Fiscal 2018 by approximately $0.5 million.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Although we conduct business in various parts of the world, our international royalty revenue is typically denominated in U.S. dollars.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	However, because our international licensees operate in other currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies have an impact on our royalty revenues, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The primary foreign currencies that our licensees operate in are the Euro, the Great British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the South African Rand, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan, the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Our revenues from international licensing activities comprised 55% of total revenues during Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM7A_P2_S4	A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies of countries where our licensees operate would have theoretically reduced our revenues by approximately $1.6 million.
844161_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cherokee Inc.
844161_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February 3, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows, for the year ended February 3, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").

844161_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April 19, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
844161_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
844161_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company anticipates that it will violate the liquidity covenant of its debt agreement during the upcoming twelve months and does not currently have sufficient capital to repay such debt, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
844161_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
844161_18_ITEM8_P3_S3	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

844161_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
844161_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

844161_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which assumes the Company will continue to operate as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
844161_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	As described in Note 7., the Company has $49.5 million of outstanding indebtedness under its Cerberus Credit Facility.
844161_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Based on the Company s current forecasts, the Company anticipates that it will violate the liquidity covenant included in the Cerberus Credit Facility within the next twelve months, which requires the Company to maintain liquidity of $2.0 million, comprising either cash balances or borrowing capacity under the revolving credit component of the Cerberus Credit Facility.
844161_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	As a result of the forecasted noncompliance, there is an explanatory paragraph included in the report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm describing the uncertainty about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, which itself results in noncompliance with covenants in the Cerberus Credit Facility.
844161_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, and the compliance failure, and potential failure, subject the Company to significant risks, including Cerberus s right to terminate its obligations under the Cerberus Credit Facility, declare all or any portion of the borrowed amounts then outstanding to be accelerated and due and payable, and/or exercise any other rights or remedies it may have under applicable law, including foreclosing on the Company s and/or its subsidiaries assets that serve as collateral for the borrowed amounts.
844161_18_ITEM8_P21_S3	If any of these rights were to be exercised, the Company s financial condition and ability to continue operations would be materially jeopardized.
844161_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	Management plans to address the Company s ability to continue to continue as a going concern by seeking an increase in its borrowing capacity under the Cerberus Credit Facility and amending existing covenants, or by seeking additional liquidity from other lenders with Cerberus consent.
844161_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	obligations as they come due over the next twelve months, and the successful amendment of the Cerberus Credit Facility is a critical part of the management s plans to meet its obligations as they come due.
844161_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	There is no assurance that management will be able to execute these plans.
844161_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

844161_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations and is not amortized.
844161_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	Indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
844161_18_ITEM8_P28_S4	The Company estimates these fair values based on discounted cash flow models and market place multiples that include assumptions determined by the Company s management regarding projected revenues, operating costs and discount rates.
844161_18_ITEM8_P28_S5	Management s expectations regarding license agreement renewals are also considered, along with forecasts of revenues from replacement licensees for agreements that have terminated.

844161_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	Differences between amounts initially recognized and amounts subsequently determined under audit are recognized when the differences become known and are considered collectible.
844161_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company regularly enforces its intellectual property rights and pursues third parties that are utilizing its trademarks without a license.

844161_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Tenant improvements allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit in the balance sheets and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease.
844161_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Stock option grants and restricted stock awards to employees and directors are measured and recognized as compensation expense based on estimated fair values, which are determined using option valuation models.
844161_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	These models are based on assumptions about stock price volatility, interest rates, dividend rates and other factors.
844161_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	The estimated fair value is amortized over the vesting period of the award using the graded amortization method.
844161_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Restructuring charges consist of severance, lease termination, contract termination and other restructuring-related costs.
844161_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	A liability for severance costs is recognized when the plan of termination has been communicated to the affected employees and is measured at its fair value at the communication date.
844161_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Lease and contract termination costs are recognized at the date the Company ceases using the rights conveyed by the lease or contract and are measured at fair value, which is determined based on the remaining contractual lease obligations reduced by estimated sublease rentals, if any.
844161_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
844161_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
844161_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
844161_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income during the period that includes the enactment date.
844161_18_ITEM8_P42_S3	Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
844161_18_ITEM8_P42_S4	In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
844161_18_ITEM8_P42_S5	Beginning with Fiscal 2018, the Company records the tax effect of equity issuances within the income statement rather than paid-in capital.
844161_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes based on financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return.
844161_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	A tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.
844161_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Such tax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.
844161_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Basic earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, while diluted EPS additionally includes the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and warrants as if such securities had been exercised at the beginning of the period.
844161_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	For Fiscal 2016, the weighted-average common shares outstanding includes 0.2 million shares of dilutive stock options.
844161_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	The computation of diluted common shares outstanding excludes outstanding stock options and warrants that are anti dilutive.
844161_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company has issued warrants to purchase shares of its common stock to one of its Hi-Tec licensees and to certain of its lenders and investors.
844161_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Because the warrants are assessed to be equity in nature, they are measured at fair value at inception.
844161_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	The warrants issued to the Company s licensee are recognized as additional paid-in capital and contra revenue over the period the revenue from the license is expected to be recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605-60-25 and ASC 505-50-S99-1.
844161_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	The warrants issued to the Company s lenders and investors are recognized as additional paid-in capital and charged to operating expenses in the Company s statements of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The carrying value of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their short term nature.
844161_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The carrying value of the Company s long term debt approximates fair value as these borrowings bear interest at floating rates.
844161_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
844161_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	While management bases its estimates on assumptions it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, these estimates by their nature are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
844161_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
844161_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 financial statements in order to conform to the current year presentation.
844161_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard which will supersede previous existing revenue recognition guidance.
844161_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	The standard creates a five-step model for revenue recognition that requires companies to exercise judgment when considering contract terms and relevant facts and circumstances.
844161_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The five-step model includes (1) identifying the contract, (2) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and (5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation has been satisfied.
844161_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	The standard also requires expanded disclosures surrounding revenue recognition.
844161_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	guidance issued in Fiscal 2017) is effective for the Company s fiscal year ending February 2, 2019 ( Fiscal 2019 ) and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption.
844161_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	The Company plans to adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective method beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 and estimates that the cumulative effect on adoption will be a $0.4 million charge to accrued revenue with a corresponding credit to retained earnings.
844161_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Minimum guaranteed royalties under the Company s agreements with its licensees have historically been recognized as earned in accordance with the underlying license agreements, while under this new standard, such royalties will generally be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement.
844161_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Accordingly, for license agreements with escalating minimum guaranteed royalties, revenues will generally be higher during the early years of the license agreement than they would have been under the previous guidance.
844161_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which modifies existing guidance for off-balance sheet treatment of a lessee s operating leases.
844161_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	The standard requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities related to long-term leases that were classified as operating leases under previous guidance.
844161_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	An asset would be recognized related to the right to use the underlying asset, and a liability would be recognized related to the obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease.
844161_18_ITEM8_P52_S3	The standard also requires expanded disclosures about leases.
844161_18_ITEM8_P52_S4	This guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year ending February 1, 2020 ( Fiscal 2020 ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P52_S5	The anticipated impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company s financial statements is still being evaluated, but the Company expects there will be a significant increase in its long-term assets and liabilities resulting from adoption.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation, which was adopted by the Company for Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	This guidance addresses the accounting for income tax effects at award settlement, the use of an expected forfeiture rate to estimate award cancellations prior to the vesting date and the presentation of excess tax benefits and shares surrendered for tax withholdings on the statement of cash flows.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	This guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	This is a change from the current guidance that requires such activity to be recorded in paid-in capital within stockholder s equity.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S4	This guidance will be applied prospectively and may create volatility in the Company s effective tax rate when adopted depending largely on future events and other factors which may include the Company s stock price, timing of stock option exercises, the value realized upon vesting or exercise of shares compared to the grant date fair value of those shares and any employee terminations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S5	This guidance also eliminates the requirement to estimate forfeitures, but rather provides for an election that would allow entities to account for forfeitures as they occur.
844161_18_ITEM8_P53_S6	The company has elected to continue to estimate forfeitures.
844161_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that reduces the diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows.
844161_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	This guidance is effective for the Company s Fiscal 2019.
844161_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	This guidance was adopted by the Company in Fiscal 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which modifies guidance for determining whether a transaction involves the purchase or disposal of a business or an asset.
844161_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	This standard was early adopted by the Company in Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The amendments clarify that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar assets, the set of assets and activities is not a business.
844161_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to simplify the testing for goodwill impairment by removing step two from the goodwill testing.
844161_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Under previous guidance, if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount (step one), an entity would calculate an impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (step two).
844161_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	The implied fair value of goodwill was calculated by deducting the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the reporting unit s fair value as determined under step one.
844161_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	This new guidance instead provides that an impairment charge should be recognized based on the difference between a reporting unit s fair value and its carrying value.
844161_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	This guidance was adopted by the Company in Fiscal 2018 and did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to stock-based compensation.
844161_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	value of the award does not change, the vesting conditions remain the same and the classification of the award as an equity or a liability instrument does not change.
844161_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	This standard is effective for Fiscal 2019 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	On December 7, 2016, the Company acquired Hi-Tec and simultaneously sold certain sales and distribution operations of Hi-Tec to third parties along with the related assets and liabilities (the Hi-Tec Acquisition ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	These third parties became licensees of the Company at that time and include Carolina Footwear Group, LLC ( Carolina ), Batra Limited ( Batra ) and Sunningdale ( South Africa ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	On January 31, 2018, the Company sold its remaining Hi-Tec sales and distribution operations to International Brands Group ( IBG ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S3	The business sold to IBG is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S4	The Company does not have any ownership interests in Carolina, Batra, South Africa or IBG.
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S5	After these transactions and consistent with the Company s planned conversion of Hi-Tec, the Company continues to own the intellectual property of Hi-Tec.
844161_18_ITEM8_P61_S6	The Company completed the Hi-Tec Acquisition to access markets addressed by Hi-Tec with its Hi-Tec, Magnum, Interceptor and 50 Peaks brands, and provide cross-selling opportunities with the Company s other brands.
844161_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company s core business is marketing and managing its portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands.
844161_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	Accordingly, the Company s Hi-Tec sales and distribution business, which operates in Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and Asia Pacific was sold to IBG during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 for $3.1 million.
844161_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	Cash proceeds of $1.3 million were received during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, and $1.8 million of cash proceeds were received by the Company in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019.
844161_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	The operating assets and liabilities of this business were sold to IBG in conjunction with the execution of a separate license agreement that grants IBG certain sales and distribution rights for Hi-Tec products in those territories.
844161_18_ITEM8_P62_S4	The discontinued sales and distribution business was previously included in the Company s Hi-Tec reporting segment.
844161_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The net (loss) income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations includes the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities included in discontinued operations comprise the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company incurred restructuring charges of $3.8 million in Fiscal 2017 and an additional $1.1 million in Fiscal 2018 related to the Hi-Tec Acquisition and its integration into the Company s ongoing operations (the Hi-Tec Plan ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	In addition, restructuring charges of $1.0 million were incurred in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 as the Company s staff was realigned to appropriately support its current business (the Cherokee Global Brands Plan ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Payments against the restructuring plan obligations were as follows:
844161_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Hi Tec Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method and Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, and the financial statements of the Company include the operating results of Hi-Tec as of the acquisition date, December 7, 2016.
844161_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	The following table presents the allocation of purchase price to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
844161_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	have been adjusted based on additional information the Company has obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.
844161_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The intangible assets acquired comprise trademarks of $53.4 million and distributor relationships of $0.5 million, which were valued using the income approach using various methods.
844161_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	Under the income approach, an intangible asset's fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset.
844161_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Indications of value are developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of return.
844161_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	T he fair value of the trademarks was determined using discounted cash flows, which is an income approach to fair value measurement that requires a specific intangible asset to be valued from the asset grouping s overall cash flow stream.
844161_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	The fair value of distributor relationships was determined using the lost profits method.
844161_18_ITEM8_P72_S3	The fair value of acquired leasehold agreements was determined based on the differences between the contract rent and market rent for each remaining year of the leases, discounted to present value at an appropriate rate of return.
844161_18_ITEM8_P72_S4	The fair value of acquired finished goods inventories was determined based on the net retail value of the inventory less operating expenses and a reasonable profit allowance, determined on an aggregate basis.
844161_18_ITEM8_P72_S5	The fair value amounts for the intangible assets were determined using inputs observed at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, while leases and inventory were observed at Level 2.
844161_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	G oodwill primarily resulted from the synergies the Company expects to realize from the combination of Hi-Tec with Cherokee Global Brands, the assembled workforce and the deferred tax liability related to the intangibles acquired.
844161_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The fair value of assets acquired that were simultaneously sold to third parties was $11.1 million.
844161_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Accounts receivable of $8.7 million were sold to Carolina with recourse and required the Company to pay Carolina a 10% premium for amounts collected during the 210 days following the acquisition date.
844161_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	The uncollected accounts are included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheet, and a liability for the remaining amounts due to Carolina is included within other current liabilities, amounting to $0.8 million and $6.8 million at February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM8_P74_S3	The premiums for amounts collected were $0.2 million and $0.6 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively, and are included as other expense in the statement of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P74_S4	Proceeds and payments pertaining to this arrangement are included as financing activities in the statement of cash flows.
844161_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The subsidiaries acquired in the Hi-Tec Acquisition contributed $7.8 million to consolidated revenue and generated a net loss of $4.1 million during Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The Company further acquired $1.4 million of goodwill deductible for tax purposes, which is reported at the Hi-Tec segment.
844161_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	Please see Note 13 for Segment Reporting.
844161_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Business acquisition and integration costs totaled $7.5 million and $11.5 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively, consisting of legal, due diligence, integration and other costs and are classified as business acquisition and integration costs in the operating expenses section of the statement of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company assessed the acquisition under both Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) and US GAAP accounting guidance, and treated the transaction as an asset acquisition under SEC Regulation S-X-3-05 and as a business combination under Accounting Standards Update 2017-01.
844161_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined historical results of operations as if the Company had consummated the Hi-Tec Acquisition as of February 1, 2015:
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information set forth above is derived from the Company s historical financial information and the financial information of Hi-Tec for the portion of the periods presented in which Hi-Tec was a subsidiary of the Company, consisting of the period from December 7, 2016 to January 28, 2017 (the Post-Acquisition Period ).
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	The Company calculated the pro forma amounts for Hi-Tec by applying the Company s accounting policies and retroactively forecasting and pro-rating for the periods presented the results of Hi-Tec during the Post-Acquisition Period.
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	For purposes of these adjustments, non-recurring expenses, consisting of restructuring and other transaction costs, were removed.
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	The amounts of such non-recurring adjustments are $3.8 million and $10.6 million for restructuring costs and other transaction costs, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S4	In addition, Hi-Tec s financial results during the Post-Acquisition Period reflect the Company s transition of Hi-Tec s business from a full spectrum distribution model, in which one group of affiliated companies owned the Hi-Tec brands and manufactured the Hi-Tec products prior to completion of the Hi-Tec Acquisition, to a brand licensing model consistent with the Company s business.
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S5	As a result, the above pro forma financial information applies royalty rates from Hi-Tec s current license agreements to historical wholesale product sales to calculate licensing revenues, and excludes Hi-Tec s historical operating costs relating to its former distribution business, including its product sales, marketing, purchasing and distribution costs.
844161_18_ITEM8_P79_S6	Additionally, interest expense included in the above pro forma financial information is based upon the Company s current debt agreements and excludes any interest based upon the Company s former debt agreements.
844161_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	The unaudited pro forma information of the Company is presented for informational purposes only, as an aid to understanding the entities combined financial results.
844161_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	This unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should not be considered a substitute for the historical financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company s reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC.
844161_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information disclosed in this report is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of results of operations that would have been achieved had the pro forma events taken place on the dates indicated, or of the Company s future consolidated results of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Accounts receivable consists of the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for based on the Company s assessment of various factors that may affect the Company s licensees or franchisees ability to pay, such as historical experience, age of accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company s licensees or franchisees, current economic conditions and bankruptcy.
844161_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	Property and equipment consist of the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	Intangible assets consist of the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	The transition from the Company's license agreements with Target Corporation and Kohl's Illinois, Inc. in the United States to new licensees has taken longer than previously estimated.
844161_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	As a result, the Company's revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2018 were significantly lower than its revenue projections at the end of Fiscal 2017, and during its annual impairment testing for Fiscal 2018, the Company determined that projected cash flows for certain indefinite lived trademarks in its Cherokee Global Brands reportable segment indicated that the fair values of these trademarks were not in excess of their carrying values.
844161_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	Accordingly, an impairment charge of $35.5 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 to adjust the impaired trademarks to their estimated fair value of $10.3 million, which is reported as a component of operating expenses in the statement of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	Fair value was determined using level 3 measurements using the discounted cash flow method (income approach).
844161_18_ITEM8_P85_S4	In conjunction with this impairment assessment, the Company concluded that the competitive and economic environment for the use of these trademarks no longer supported an indefinite life.
844161_18_ITEM8_P85_S5	Accordingly, these trademarks will be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful lives.
844161_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Hi-Tec Acquisition during Fiscal 2017 resulted in trademarks valued at $53.4 million, including $52.4 million that are classified as indefinite lived and not subjected to amortization.
844161_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	In addition, distributor relationships were valued at $0.5 million but were sold in Fiscal 2018, and the amortization thereof is presented in the statements of operations as a component of discontinued operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	The distributor relationships are presented as noncurrent assets of discontinued operations in the balance sheet for Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company has acquired other trademarks and franchise agreements that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives with no residual values.
844161_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	The weighted-average amortization period for trademarks and franchise agreements was 10.0 and 11.0, respectively, at February 3, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	The trademarks are being renewed on a continuing basis.
844161_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Amortization of intangible assets was $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $0.9 million for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	Expected amortization of intangible assets for fiscal years ending in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 is approximately $1.1 million, $0.9 million, $0.9 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	Trademark registration and renewal costs capitalized during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 totaled $0.1 million in both periods.
844161_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	Goodwill arose from historical acquisitions and the Hi-Tec Acquisition that occurred during Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	Additional goodwill of $0.9 million was recorded during Fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of finalizing the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired during the Hi-Tec Acquisition that were simultaneously sold to third parties.
844161_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	A portion of goodwill was allocated based on fair value to the sales and distribution business that was sold during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Other current liabilities consists of the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	On December 7, 2016, in connection with the closing of the Hi-Tec Acquisition, the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC ( Cerberus ), which was amended in August 2017 and November 2017 (the Cerberus Credit Facility ) and provides a $45.0 million term loan and a revolving credit facility up to $5.0 million.
844161_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	The Company used a portion of the term loan proceeds to fund the Hi-Tec Acquisition, including the repayment of substantially all the outstanding indebtedness of Hi-Tec, and to repay all amounts owed under its previous credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	Proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used for working capital purposes.
844161_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Principal repayments of the term loan are required quarterly and interest is payable monthly.
844161_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	During the year ended February 3, 2018, the Company drew down $5.0 million under its revolving credit facility.
844161_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Cerberus Credit Facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and is guaranteed by the Company s subsidiaries.

844161_18_ITEM8_P119_S3	The compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures over the award s service period.
844161_18_ITEM8_P119_S4	The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period as a component of operating expenses in the statements of operations, and amounted to $1.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 respectively.
844161_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	The estimated fair value of stock options granted was estimated using the following assumptions:
844161_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	The expected dividend yield is based on past dividends paid and the current dividend yield at the time of grant, and the expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock price.
844161_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term.
844161_18_ITEM8_P121_S2	The expected life of the stock options is based on historical experience of similar options, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
844161_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	Changes in shares under options are summarized as follows:
844161_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted under the 2013 Plan was $1.51, $3.82 and $6.35 for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 respectively.

844161_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	The average share price is calculated as the average of all market closing prices during the January preceding the applicable fiscal year end.
844161_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	If a target is met at the end of a fiscal year, one third of the shares subject to the award will vest.
844161_18_ITEM8_P128_S2	If the stock price target is not met at the end of a fiscal year, the relevant portion of the shares subject to the award will not vest but will roll over to the following fiscal year.

844161_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	The target average share price was not achieved for Fiscal 2018 or 2017.
844161_18_ITEM8_P129_S1	Since the vesting of these performance based equity awards is subject to market-based performance conditions, the fair value of these awards was measured on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model for each vesting tranche.
844161_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions and the resulting fair value of the award.
844161_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	In June 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted restricted stock units and stock options to each member of the Board of Directors and to each of the Company s executive officers under the 2013 Plan.

844161_18_ITEM8_P153_S0	Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within the provision for income taxes in the statements of operations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P153_S1	The total amount of interest recognized related to unrecognized tax benefits was $0.1 million for Fiscal 2018, and was insignificant for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016.
844161_18_ITEM8_P154_S0	Although we cannot predict the timing of resolution with taxing authorities, if any, we believe it is reasonably possible that $3.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in the next twelve months due to change in the composition of a consolidated tax filing group or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P154_S1	At February 3, 2018, approximately $1.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits would, if recognized, impact the Company s effective tax rate.
844161_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, California and certain other state jurisdictions.
844161_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	For federal income tax purposes, the Fiscal 2015 and later tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal three-year statute of limitations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P155_S2	For state tax purposes, the Fiscal 2014 and later tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under a four-year statute of limitations.
844161_18_ITEM8_P156_S0	The Company maintains a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, under which the Company makes contributions to match the contributions made by employees participating in the plan.
844161_18_ITEM8_P156_S1	These matching contributions were approximately $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017, and Fiscal 2016, respectively.
844161_18_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company identifies its reportable segments based on how management internally evaluates financial information, business activities and management responsibility.
844161_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	Beginning in Fiscal 2017, the Company s reportable segments are Cherokee Global Brands and Hi-Tec.
844161_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	Prior to the Hi-Tec Acquisition, the Company s business activities comprised one reportable segment.
844161_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	Financial information for the Company s reportable segments is as follows:
844161_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	Revenues by geographic area based upon the licensees country of domicile comprise the following:
844161_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	Long lived assets located in the United States and outside the United States amount to $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at February 3, 2018, $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, at January 28, 2017, and $0.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at January 30, 2016.
844161_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	A summary of quarterly financial data (unaudited) is presented below.
844161_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company disposed of a sales and distribution business, which has been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented below because the business was acquired in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	Quarterly computations of per share amounts are made independently and, as a result, the sum of per share amounts for the four quarters in any one fiscal year may not add to the per share amount for such fiscal year.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of February 3, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013) ( COSO ).
844161_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on this assessment under the COSO framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 3, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	During Fiscal 2018, our management, with the oversight of our Audit Committee, developed and implemented a plan to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified as of January 28, 2017 and described in our annual report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2017.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	These material weaknesses related to the design and operation of controls over our closing processes in connection with the consolidation of the operations we acquired in the Hi-Tec Acquisition, and our controls over the application of applicable purchase accounting principles in connection with the Hi-Tec Acquisition.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	We completed our remediation plan during fiscal 2018.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	As part of our remediation plan, we took certain actions to enhance our controls over the financial closing and reporting process and consolidation of Hi-Tec, and we believe that these controls have been appropriately designed and are operating effectively as of February 3, 2018.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Specifically, we have remediated the design and operating effectiveness deficiencies around the controls over our closing process in connection with the consolidation of the Hi-Tec operations by hiring internal personal at Hi-Tec that have the relevant experience and expertise to prepare financial statements in conformity with US GAAP and that provide additional financial oversight to meet reporting deadlines.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	With respect to our controls over the application of purchase accounting principles under US GAAP, we have remediated the design of these controls as of February 3, 2018 by hiring additional personnel who have sufficient knowledge of US GAAP and who can exercise adequate oversight of third-party advisors who have the appropriate expertise to assist with the application of purchase accounting principles or other complex transactions.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Because this control operates on an infrequent basis and did not operate during fiscal 2018, we have determined that deficiency in the design of the controls over the application of purchase accounting principles under US GAAP has been remediated.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Deloitte Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm that has audited the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included on the following page of this Annual Report.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Except for the matters discussed in this Item 9A above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P8_S0	In designing our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P8_S1	In addition, the design of our controls and procedures must reflect that resource constraints exist, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Because of these inherent limitations, our disclosure and internal controls may not prevent or detect all instances of fraud, misstatements or other control issues.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P8_S3	In addition, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure or internal controls to future periods are subject to risks, including, among others, that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P9_S0	To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cherokee Inc.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Cherokee Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of February 3, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
844161_18_ITEM9A_P10_S1	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P11_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 3, 2018, of the Company and our report dated April 19, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to going concern due to an anticipated violation of a debt covenant during the upcoming twelve months.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P12_S0	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P12_S1	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P12_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P13_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P13_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P13_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P13_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P14_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P15_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
844161_18_ITEM9A_P15_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
844161_18_ITEM9B_P0_S0	On April 13, 2018, Frank Tworecke a member of our Board of Directors, notified the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board that he will not stand for re-election as a director of the Company at the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
